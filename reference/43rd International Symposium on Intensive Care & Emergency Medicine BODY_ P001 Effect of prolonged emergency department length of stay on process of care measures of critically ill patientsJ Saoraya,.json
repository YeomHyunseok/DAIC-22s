However, whether this association would exist in settings that have implemented a critical care consultation model in the ED remains unknown. We thus sought to explore the association between prolonged ED length of stay (LOS) and the deployment of evidence-based processes of care measures for critically ill patients in hospitals implementing a critical care consultation model in the ED.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study including eight academic intensive care units (ICUs) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (i.e., Toronto Intensive Care Observational Registry: iCORE) from June 2014 to February 2023. We included adult patients who were directly admitted to the ICU from the ED. Patients with ED LOS for more than 24 h were excluded. The cohort was divided into an acceptable ED LOS group (LOS < 6 h) and a long ED LOS group (LOS 6–24 h). We explored the association between long ED LOS and processes of care measures on day 2 after admission to the ICU using logistic regression. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, severity, study site, and diagnosis.Results:We included 7072 patients, of whom 1462 (20.7%) patients had long ED LOS. Both groups had comparable severity at baseline. In the long ED LOS group, more patients had cardiovascular, chronic respiratory, and chronic kidney disease as comorbidities and fewer patients were admitted due to trauma. There was no difference in the deployment of processes of care measures on day 2 after admission to the ICU between the two groups, as shown in the Table.Conclusions:In this multicenter study of ICUs in Toronto where a critical care consultation model has been implemented in the ED, long ED LOS was not associated with a decrease in the deployment of evidence-based processes of care measures for critically ill adult patients.Table (abstract P001)Process of care measures on day 2Process outcomesLong ED LOS; N = 1462Acceptable ED LOS; N = 5610Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI)Low tidal volume ventilation174/281 (61.9%)643/979 (65.7%)0.84 (0.62–1.13)Spontaneous breathing trial among those eligible245/575 (42.6%)950/2493 (38.1%)1.09 (0.90–1.33)Extubation among those eligible116/179 (64.8%)480/685 (70.1%)0.76 (0.52–1.11)DVT prophylaxis among those eligible751/968 (77.6%)2353/3225 (73%)1.15 (0.96–1.37)Continuous sedation723/1186 (61%)3002/4609 (65.1%)0.92 (0.80–1.06)Physical restraints503/1184 (42.5%)1979/4590 (43.1%)1.08 (0.93–1.25)P002 Development of intensive medicine in the emergency department: 1 year"

This article aims to present and analyse the results of the first year of ICS support to the ED in a central hospital in this region.Methods:The analysis of records was conducted using the ED application, covering the period from June 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022. Records made in the ED were considered, as well as data related to all patients transferred to intensive care units (ICU).Results:During this period, the ED admitted a total of 155,786 patients, with 69,290 triaged (Manchester’s triage) as yellow priority, 10,750 as orange priority, and 721 as red priority. Out of 873 patients evaluated by the intensivist in the ED, 804 were admitted in the ICU, while 47 died in the ED, 28 of which did not require admission to ICU. ICS support was primarily provided to medical patients (52%), followed by trauma patients (18.9%) and surgical patients (13.7%). ICS conducted observations within the first 2 h of stay in the ED in 39.4% of cases and after 12 h in 15% of cases. Written records on-site were made in 56% of patients evaluated by ICS in the ED, making it difficult to define the moment of intervention due to posthumous records in critical patients.Conclusions:The shortage of requests for collaboration in trauma patients can be attributed to the traditional management of such patients by surgical specialties and anesthesia. These initial results provide valuable insights to plan the restructuring of teams and training of intensivists in approaching these critical patients in the context of the ED.P003 Leveraging routinely collected data and large language models to inform patients about their emergency department stay: a feasibility studyD von Wedel1, M Thiele2, D Shay3, R Leuner1, SF Bigdon4, F Balzer1, N Rutsch41Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Medical Informatics, Berlin, Germany,2Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany,3Harvard T.H.

This study complies with the Swiss Human Research Act. Medical history, diagnoses, and interventions of the ED-stay, alongside physicians’ recommendations on next steps after discharge were extracted from patient charts using GPT-4 through the Application Programming Interface (Figure). Then, the LLM was prompted to combine information into an easily understandable summary. Two clinicians independently assessed completeness in the LLM’s reporting of a priori-defined items, which included aspects a patient must be informed about by a physician before being discharged. They further checked for the introduction of medical errors in LLM-generated summaries.Results:The median (interquartile range) proportion of a priori-defined items reported in LLM-generated summaries was 75.0% (57.3–100). 8/30 (26.7%) summaries included all items. No medical errors were introduced by the LLM.Conclusions:After prompt refinement and validation in external cohorts, LLMs may be an effective tool to create individualized ED-patient discharge summaries. Furthermore, LLM’s ability to easily translate texts to other languages might help communicate information to patients with limited proficiency in the local language. Inclusion of interactive elements, allowing for patient-chatbot interaction, could reduce follow-up questions, readmissions, and workload.ReferencesAyers JW et al.

Overall, the BV score was lower in patients for whom no antibiotics were prescribed (n = 95; median = 8 [2–31]) compared to patients receiving antibiotics (n = 90; median = 96 [2–31]). In patients where the decision was changed in favor of giving antibiotics, the BV score was higher (n = 12; median = 72 [49–97]) compared to patients not given antibiotics (n = 95; median = 8 [2–31]) (Figure). In patients where the decision was changed in favor of not giving antibiotics, the BV score was lower (n = 3; median = 4 [2–31]) compared to patients given antibiotics (n = 90; median = 96 [2–31]).

Previous research has shown that the advanced alert monitor (AAM), an automated early warning score (EWS) based on electronic medical records (EMR) data, improved patient outcomes in an American multicenter trial [1, 2]. The objective of this study is to determine if the AAM can achieve the same performance outside its original population in a Dutch hospital.Methods:Data was extracted from the EMR for all patients admitted to the Catharina Hospital (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) from December 2018 till January 2023. The data was preprocessed similar to the original study [1]. The data was divided into hospital admissions episodes with and without adverse events. Events were defined based on IC admissions, mortality, and acute surgeries. The AAM was evaluated and compared to the national early warning score (NEWS) as a baseline.

We recently implemented a novel sepsis diagnostic (IntelliSep, Cytovale, SanFrancisco, USA) into the sepsis process of a large US academic medical center. Using a pre-post analysis, we studied the impact of this implementation on the efficiency of sepsis care.Methods:In the pre-implementation (control) cohort, IntelliSep was performed but not released to clinicians in Jun-2023. For the post-implementation (intervention) cohort, IntelliSep was performed and released as standard care from Aug through Sept-2023.

Furthermore, type and number of organ failures were estimated.Methods:A register-based cohort study including all acute patients with a contact to an emergency department (ED) from 1 January 2016 to 19 March 2018. Sepsis patients were identified based on fulfilling following criteria: (1) blood culture performed within 48 h of arrival, (2) antibiotic(s) administered within 48 h of arrival, and (3) 1 organ failure(s) based on a SOFA-score modified for the ED. An increase of 2 point for an organ at the modified SOFA-score was considered equivalent to one organ failure. We calculated 7-, 30-, and 90-days mortality rates.

Poster (Figure) was drawn to illustrate differences between both conditions, followed by second-round survey to access level of understanding.Results:There were 101 participants in first survey. 69% had post diploma education. 42% were not aware of differences between cardiac arrest and heart attack. Participants that said were aware of differences, only 63% knew cardiac arrest had no pulse and breathing. 51% mistakenly expressed shortness of breath as a symptom. For heart attack, 51% mistook speech difficulty and 12% mistook no pulse as symptoms. 18% would perform CPR and 14% would retrieve AED for someone with chest pain. 38% stated lack of confidence as barrier to performing CPR, and 37% stated fear of prosecution for unsuccessful CPR. 50% expressed making CPR an educational requirement for students, and 16% stated more campaigns to raise awareness could increase bystander CPR. There were 62 participants in the second survey on poster feedback. 42% did not know there was difference between cardiac arrest and heart attack. 70% understood the poster content, while 10% stated poster should be simplified more. While 97% stated the poster could help raise awareness between both conditions and importance of CPR, only 79% understood the differences after reading the poster.Conclusions:Significant proportion of public confuses cardiac arrest and heart attack, despite from high education background.

The purpose of our case–control study is to determine whether history of parental heart disease was associated with OHCA incidence, and the effect of parental history is affected by the own heart disease history.Methods:We conducted a multicenter prospective case–control study in 17 University hospitals in Korea from September 2017 to December 2020. Cases were EMS-treated OHCA patients age 19–79 with presumed cardiac etiology. Community-based controls were recruited at a 1:1 ratio after matching age, sex, and urbanization level of residence. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis were conducted to estimate the risk of parental heart disease including coronary artery disease (CAD), non-CAD, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) on OHCA. Interaction analysis between parental heart disease and own heart disease were also performed.Results:A total 948 OHCA cases and 948 community-based controls were analyzed. Compared to the no parental SCD group, the risks of OHCA increased in the parental SCD group [aOR (95% CI): 2.67 (1.65–4.30)]. Parental history of SCD had interaction effects with own non-coronary heart disease for OHCA incidence: 2.60 (1.45–4.66) for no heart disease and 2.08 (0.43–10.07) for heart disease (pfor interaction < 0.05).Conclusions:In our study, parental history of SCD increased the incidence of OHCA and the effect of parental history for SCD was maintained in patients without own heart disease.P012 Intra-arrest transport and good neurological recovery among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with refractory ventricular fibrillation: a nationwide observational studyJ Lee, H Ryu, J Lee, C ParkChonnam National University, Emergency Department, Gwangju, South KoreaCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P012Introduction:This study analyzes the impact of on-scene resuscitation and intra-arrest transport on survival outcomes for patients with recurrent ventricular fibrillation (rVF) following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Here we performed RNAseq analysis of circulating monocytes and identified 38 genes differentially expressed between patients with and without massive vascular leakage after cardiac arrest. Among them, a gene coding for a protein P (ongoing patent protection) had a 56-time higher expression in patients with massive leakage. In accordance, plasma levels of P-protein strongly associated with the level of fluid requirements in a validation cohort of 52 post-cardiac arrest patients. The objective of the study was to characterize P-protein effects on post-cardiac arrest vascular leakage.Methods:Effects of P-protein was analyzed in a model of resuscitated cardiac arrest in mice, with a no-flow and a low-flow time of 8 min each.Results:In vivo, we confirmed an important vascular leakage in all organs after the return of spontaneous circulation"

Consistent with less myocardial edema, left ventricular ejection fraction was also significantly improved in rmP-protein-injected mice. Finally, survival significantly increased in mice injected with the protein versus controls (Figure).Conclusions:These results demonstrate that P-protein, identified from human samples, is a key regulator of post-cardiac arrest vascular leakage, and a promising new treatment during this condition.

It is a well-known fact that hypoxemia correlates to higher mortality in the ICU; however, hyperoxemia could be related to similarly negative outcomes [1]. Patients suffering from acute brain injury, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), post cardiac arrest (PCA), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or stroke, may be particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of oxygen [2]. The primary objective of our study was to determine if arterial hyperoxia correlates with higher mortality in patients with acute brain injury.Methods:We performed a systematic review in a number of databases for studies on the relationship between hyperoxia and mortality in adult intensive care unit (ICU). The definition of hyperoxia used the arterial PO2stated by each independent study. Studies including paediatric patients, patients with neurological or respiratory disease, or hyperbaric oxygenation were excluded. We evaluated risk of bias through the ROBINS-I tool.

This study aimed to assess the impact of CI at intensive care unit (ICU) admission on regional and global cerebral oxygen metabolism in ABI patients.Methods:We prospectively analyzed consecutive ABI patients requiring invasive monitoring of regional partial brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and global cerebral oxygen metabolism in two academic ICUs. The first available PbtO2measurement was categorized based on CI (< 2.4 vs. ≥ 2.4 L/min), ICP (< 20 vs. ≥ 20 mmHg), and CPP (< 65, 65–80, and > 80 mmHg). Regional hypoxia was defined as PbtO2< 20 mmHg, and global anaerobic metabolism was assessed by SvjO2< 60%, oxygen glucose index (OGI < 6), lactate glucose index (LGI < 0), lactate oxygen index (LOI < 0), or cerebral lactate > 2 mmol/L.Results:We included 51 patients (median age 56.0 years, IQR [44.0–65.0]), most of them (n = 31, 61%) suffered spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients with low CI (1.8 L/min [1.7–2.1]) exhibited significantly lower PbtO2 compared to those with higher CI (12 mmHg [9–20] vs. 24 mmHg [19–32];p= 0.004). Similar associations were observed with elevated ICP (12 mmHg [6–19] vs. 24 mmHg [18–32];p= 0.006) and low CPP (10 mmHg [8–16] vs. 24 mmHg [12–27] vs. 24 mmHg [18–34];p= 0.016). Notably, CI displayed a significant positive correlation with PbtO2(r = 0.3; 95% CI 0.01–0.52;p= 0.03). Interestingly, only low CPP levels were associated with elevated cerebral lactate levels (2.65 mmol/L [1.58, 3.88] vs. 2.10 mmol/L [1.65–5.95] vs. 1.20 mmol/L [0.98–1.53];p= 0.02).Conclusions:Low CI at ICU admission significantly impacts regional cerebral oxygenation in ABI patients, independent of ICP and CPP levels.

The viral load of SARS-CoV-2, which can be identified using the Ct value [2], can also be a risk factor for ECP. In the study, we investigated the probable risk factors for encephalitis in patients with COVID-19. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 viral load at ICU admission may predict COVID-19-induced ECP.Methods:This was a single-center retrospective study between May 2020 and August 2022. Patients older than 18 years with COVID-19 whose length of ICU stays (LOS-ICU) was over one week were included. Patients were divided into ECP + and ECP − groups. In the patients’ weaning period, ECP was diagnosed by altered mental status or presence of seizure and positive CSF and MRI findings. Patients' characteristics, laboratories, and the Ct values at the ICU admission and outcomes were recorded.Results:ECP was diagnosed in 38 (39.6%) of 96 patients. Seizure was observed in 10 (27%) patients with ECP. In the ECP + group, age, d-dimer levels, MV duration, and LOS-ICU were significantly higher, whereas Ct levels were significantly lower than in the ECP-group (p= 0.006,p< 0.001,p= 0.006,p= 0.009 andp< 0.001 respectively). For ECP + , the AUC values of age (> 70), Ct (≤ 26.2) and D-dimer (> 2.3) were 0.67 (0.56–0.79), 0.71 (0.60–0.82) and 0.78 (0.68–0.88) (p= 0.004,p= 0.001 andp< 0.001). In the Cox regression analysis, the risk of ECP + was 1.9-fold (1.1–4.4) and 2.9-fold (1.3–6.6) increased by only Ct ≤ 26.2 and D-dimer > 2.3 at the ICU admission (p= 0.032,p= 0.010).Conclusions:The viral load at ICU admission is an important risk factor for COVID-19-induced ECP. This risk is increased by an especially high viral load combined with high D-dimer. Moreover, the existence of ECP results in increased MV duration and LOS-ICU.ReferencesPilotto A et al.

Descriptive statistics of the variables were performed, followed by an analysis of the medians and difference in the sum of ranges of hospital stay. In addition, Spearman or Pearson’s correlations were performed, as appropriate. The definition of anemia was adjusted for height in mSNM (hemoglobin males < 14.3 and females < 13.3 g/dL).Results:A total of 201 patients were included in the analysis: 41.29% men and 58.71% women. Mean age 53.38 years (sd:13.96). The prevalence of anemia was 35.32%. The mean hemoglobin level was 14.3 Â g/dL (sd 1.55); in the anemia group it was 12.7 (sd 1.02) versus 15.13 (sd 1.11) (p= 0.00001). More complications were found in patients with PA, which were statistically significant for operative site infections (p= 0.043). PA was associated with a higher LOS because of the difference between the sum of the ranks (p= 0.003). An inverse correlation was found between hemoglobin levels and hospital stay (⍴:− 0.2;p= 0.004). The Table shows the behavior of the LOS and its variables. It can be seen that LOS was associated with PA and a higher rate of reoperation and readmission to the intensive care unit.Conclusions:PA was frequent in our STTR population and associated with a higher LOS and incidence of operative site infection.Table (abstract P024)Relationship between anemia, quartiles of median hospital stay, and postoperative complications in patients undergoing supratentorial tumor resection at 2600 m above sea leveln = 201Length of stay (days) M(p25–p75)IQRpvalueAge (years) < 60 versus ≥ 60(4 vs. 4)(3–5 vs. 3–5)(2 vs. 2)0.8 uRenal failure No versus Yes(4 vs. 3)(3–5 vs. 3–3)(2 vs. 0)0.5 uPreoperative anemia* No versus Yes(4 vs. 4)(3–5 vs. 3–5)(2 vs. 2)0.03 uTransfusion requirement No versus Yes(4 vs. 11)(3–5 vs. 5–45)(2 vs. 40)0.007 uSurgical site infection No versu Yes(4 vs. 45)(3–5 vs. 3–92)(2–88)0.1 uICU readmission No versus Yes(4 vs 26.5)(3–5 vs. 4–92)(2 vs. 88)0.03 uReoperation No versus Yes(4 vs 11)(3–5 vs. 6–45)(2 vs. 39)0.000 uuMann Whitney U test + Kruskal Wallis test *There were significant differences between the two groups; however, this was due to the length of stay of the patients in the extreme preoperative anemia category.P025 A rare complication of a trans-thoracic core biopsyD Correia1, J Gonçalves2, P La Feria3, G Nobre de Jesus1, C Candeias1, JM Ribeiro11Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte, Intensive Care Medicine Department, Lisboa, Portugal,2Centro Hospitalar do Oeste, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Caldas da Rainha, Portugal,3Hospital Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Amadora, PortugalCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P025Introduction:Percutaneous CT-guided biopsies are recommended for suspicious lung lesions.

Median duration of mechanical ventilation was 35 days and median ICU length of stay (LOS) was 42 days. The majority of cEEG (61.1%) was performed due to medical reasons (ichaemic stroke, septic shock, status epilepticus); 25.9% of cEEG was conducted in neurosurgical patients (both post traumatic acute brain injury and malignancy) whereas 13% was carried out in post-anoxic comatose patients. Patients who started anticonvulsant therapy after EEG examination had higher mortality rate than patients who had already received anticonvulsant medications (x2= 8.077,p= 0.004). In more than half of the patients encephalopathic EEG pattern was observed in comparison with a lower percentage of patients who had lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs); one patient had burst suppression and one patient had electrocerebral inactivity (ECI) or silence (ECS).

Furthermore as statistical reports showed that the country with the highest rates of new strokes and deaths due to stroke is Romania. According to studies, the time elapsed from onset to reperfusion treatment is very important, and according to the current protocol, only those with onset up to 4.5 h can perform thrombolytic therapy and/or up to 6 h, mechanical reperfusion therapies such as thrombectomy.Methods:The study was carried out in the Emergency Municipal Clinical Hospital, the second-largest hospital with about 30,000 annual ED patient visits.

Of the factors that contribute to the delay in admission to the ED after the onset of stroke symptoms, most can be overcome. To improve community awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke, health promotion campaigns are needed, and timely transfer to hospitals with thrombolysis facilities and effective use of the ambulance service are strategies that help early presentation to reperfusion treatment after stroke onset.Table (abstract P027)Characteristics of patientsRisk factorsFull sample, n = 202Under 4.5 h, n = 98Over 4.5 h, n = 104pvalueObesity12 (5.94%)8 (8.16%)4 (3.84%)0.120Smoking37 (18.31%)25 (25.51%)12 (11.53%)0.005*Alcohol31 (15.34%)16 (16.32%)17 (16.34%)0.986Dyslipidemia22 (10.89%)8 (8.16%)14 (13.46%)0.7Arterial hypertension164 (81.18%)73 (74.48%)91 (87.5%)0.670Diabetes mellitus53 (26.23%)27 (27.55%)26 (25.0%)1.00Atrial fibrillation40 (19.80%)15 (15.30%)25 (24.03%)0.752Anticoagulant treatment34 (16.63%)16 (16.32%)18 (17.30%)0.950P028 Analysis of inflammatory biomarkers in predicting delayed cerebral ischemia in non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)S Serra Soler1, M Sánchez Satorra2, MT Misis del Campo2, M Alcalde-Herraiz3, M Català4, J Ferrés Llach2, I Selva Armadans1, M Bauçà Socías2, T Pons Lopez2, D Mota Montané21Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Medicina Intensiva, Badalona, Spain,2Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Intensive Care Unit, Badalona, Spain,3Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain,4Oxford University, Oxford, UKCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P028Introduction:Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents a neurological emergency.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of TEG-PM in SEA patients with sICH on aspirin and/or clopidogrel.Methods:This is a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to a SEA intensive care unit from August 2022 to June 2023 with sICH. Patients were divided into two groups: those taking aspirin, and/or clopidogrel, and a control group. Patients on anticoagulants were excluded. TEG-PM was performed within 6 h after symptom onset. Computed tomography head (CTH) was obtained on admission and at 24 ± 12 h.Results:Thirty-four patients with sICH were included. 14 were on aspirin or clopidogrel, and 20 were controls. Patients on antiplatelet had higher mean arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibition than controls. Mean (SD) AA inhibition was 88.5%(13.4) in the antiplatelet group, and 54.4%(38.2) in the control group (p< 0.001). Mean maximum amplitude was higher in controls than the antiplatelet group (36.7 vs. 24.1,p= 0.025). Platelet dysfunction was observed in 7 controls; the dysfunction was not accounted for by antiplatelet therapy. Haemorrhagic expansion on CTH was not associated with increase or decrease in AA inhibition (p= 0.29).Conclusions:This is the first prospective study in SEA patients. TEG-PM is able to detect platelet inhibition in SEA patients with sICH on antiplatelet. However, the overlap in platelet inhibition values between the antiplatelet and control group may confound its clinical usefulness and defining suitable transfusion thresholds.

Detection and management of DIND after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) are very heterogeneous. Our study aims to provide a description of DIND episodes and applied therapeutic strategies, comparing them with functional outcomes.Methods:A 7-year monocentric observational retrospective study of a total 270 consecutive aSAH treated patients to describe the deficit and compare only medical therapy and rescue therapy.Results:Through electronic medical records, it was found that 27.8% experienced DIND, typically around the 6.5th day, documented at discharge as clinical/angiographic evidence of vasospasm, requiring specific treatment (Table). All patients with DIND received hemodynamic therapy; in 18 of them the deficit resolved (average saline bolus = 1.26 L/24 h; maximum mean dose of norepinephrine = 0.18 mcg/kg/min; ∆mean arterial pressure = 24 mmHg). No episodes of rebleeding after the increased pressure. 57 patients required rescue therapy, with all of them receiving intra-arterial nimodipine; 57.9% underwent angioplasty. 87.7% needed external ventricular drainage. Episodes of high-ICP occurred in 63.2% of this group. The mean ICP value that triggered therapy was 24.5 mmHg; treatment involved hypertonic (47.4%), mannitol (36.8%) and decompressive craniectomy (10.7%). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of in-hospital mortality (23.5% vs. 17.9%). However, comparing the overall population with DIND patients, a significant difference was found in the functional outcome at discharge: respectively, went home 139 (52.1%) versus 23 (31.5%).Conclusions:The difficulty with DIND remains early recognition and the high functional impact among people in their working years.

SIs, specifically hypoxemia and hypotension, aggravate brain damage following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are associated with injury severity, treatment intensity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and patient outcomes.Methods:We extracted data from ICU patients recruited for the CENTER-TBI study and divided them into four groups according to the occurrence of SIs in the prehospital setting: hypoxemia (SpO2< 90%), hypotension (SBp< 90 mmHg), both, no SIs. We then compared neuronal (expressed by the release of UCH-L1 and t-Tau) and glial (expressed by the release of GFAP) injury and the biomarker ratios among the groups.Results:A total of 1695 patients were included in the analysis. The impact of SIs on neuronal and glial injury showed significant differences among the four groups (Table). UCH-L1 and t-Tau levels were higher in the presence of hypotension and both SIs compared to the no-SIs group, whereas they showed only a slight increase in the case of hypoxemia alone. Conversely, GFAP values did not differ significantly among the four groups. Additionally, the UCHL-1/GFAP and t-Tau/GFAP ratios displayed higher values in hypotension and both SIs groups and minimum values in patients without SIs or with hypoxemia only.Conclusions:Early SIs led to the release of brain injury biomarkers, with a more significant increase in biomarkers of cell body and axonal injury than of glial injury. Moreover, there was a clear hierarchy among the four groups, with patients affected by hypotension and both SIs showing the highest values. This was further confirmed by the rise in the two ratios. These findings could have potential implications for the management of hypotension and hypoxemia in the prehospital setting.Table (abstract P032)ResultsNo SIsHypoxemiaHypotensionBothN (%)1280 (75.5)158 (9.3)142 (8.4)115 (6.8)UCH-L1***245.90 (108.8, 531.7)344.50 (182.5, 717.9)362.71 (177.8, 849.4)449.03 (240.1, 887.9)t-Tau***6.29 (3.0, 13.4)7.90 (4.1, 18.6)9.43 (4.6, 20.7)10.43 (5.5, 19.3)GFAP°14.66 (4.8, 36.7)17.63 (7.5, 41.2)15.92 (5.7, 42.7)17.18 (6.0, 50.8)RatiosUCH-L1/GFAP***16.86 (11.9, 26.7)17.44 (11.95, 33.3)20.38 (14.4, 30.4)23.19 (15.2, 53.1)t-Tau/GFAP*0.47 (0.3, 0.8)0.43 (0.3, 0.96)0.56 (0.3, 1.1)0.62 (0.4, 1.4)Data are median (IQR); first value; Abbreviations: GFAP = glial fibrillary acidic protein (mcg/L), UCH-L1 = ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (pg/mL), t-Tau = total Tau (pg/mL).

There is wide intra-patient LLA and ULA variability. Perioperative exposure to mean arterial pressure (MAP) outside of these limits is presumably linked to postoperative complications. We have developed a novel index, the Cerebral Adaptive Index (CAI), which quantifies the effectiveness of CA in real-time on a 0–100 scale. CAI is derived from MAP and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (StO2) measurements based on modified coherence analysis. We sought to validate the capability of CAI to characterize the status of CA against CA labels obtained from simultaneous measurements of MAP and transcranial doppler (TCD) CBF velocity (CBFV).Methods:We conducted a prospective observational study in 50 surgical patients to simultaneously collect MAP, cerebral StO2, and CBFV data. Individual plots of CBFV versus MAP were constructed and the LLA and ULA determined. CAI values were generated by postprocessing MAP and cerebral StO2data through the CAI algorithm. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was then conducted to assess the capability of CAI to discriminate the two classes: 1. The dysfunctional autoregulation class, where MAP is beyond the individual LLA/ULA limits; 2. The functional autoregulation class, where MAP is within the LLA/ULA limits.Results:Enrolled patients (12 females, 38 males; mean ± SD age, 63 ± 14 years), underwent cardiac (n = 27) or non-cardiac (n = 23) surgeries. The ROC analysis (Figure) shows area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.94, 0.85, and 0.954, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of CAI to discriminate the state of functional autoregulation from the state of dysfunctional autoregulation.Conclusions:Real-time monitoring of cerebral autoregulation based on MAP and regional cerebral StO2is feasible. The proposed CAI index may allow for personalized CA-oriented MAP targets.Figure (abstract P033)ROC curve for CAI. The reported values of sensitivity and specificity are obtained with a CAI threshold value of 45, chosen in order to minimize false positive (FP) rate while preserving true positive (TP) rate.

The inflammatory response after TBI might play a major role in healing and recovery. However, a dysregulated inflammatory response could be deleterious. A better understanding of these dynamics could improve TBI outcomes.Methods:From December 2019 to August 2023, we conducted a prospective cohort in a single Colombian center. Patients older than 17 y, admitted to the ICU for moderate and severe TBI, and an mRS < 3 were enrolled. Data was collected in RedCap, including demographics, the severity of the injury, lab tests, and hospital variables. Blood samples were drawn at 72 h post-injury. IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were measured. Outcomes at 6 months were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). The unfavorable outcome was defined as GOSE < 4. Univariate and multivariate analysis assessed the association between inflammatory cytokines and GOSE. RStudio was used for the analysis.Results:During the study, 96 patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 35.5 (24.2–53.7), and the most frequent cause was road traffic accidents (58%). 83/96 patients (86%) had severe TBI (AIS head ≥ 3). At 6-month follow-up, 41/96 (42%) had GOSE < 4. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between unfavorable outcomes and age, head AIS, APACHE II, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 at 72 h. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted by age, head trauma severity, and systemic compromise, yielded three models for each cytokine. Following adjustment, IL-1β and TNF-α showed significant association (Table).Conclusions:In this cohort, higher levels of IL-1B and TNF-α measured at 72 h post-injury were positively correlated to fatality and disability. Further research is needed to understand the role of inflammation after TBI and its use as a potential therapeutic target.Table (abstract P034)Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinical variables and cytokines with a 6-month unfavorable outcome in patients with TBI admitted to ICUVariablesUnivariate analysis (OR [95% CI];pvalue)IL-1β Multivariate analysis (OR [95% CI];pvalueTNF-α Multivariate analysis (OR [95% CI];pvalue)Age1.04 [1.01–1.07]; 0.011.06 [1.02–1.11]; < 0.011.04 [1.01–1.09]; 0.03Admission GCS0.77 [0.68–0.88]; < 0.01AIS head3.10 [1.67–5.76]; < 0.012.63 [1.08–6.36]; 0.032.77 [1.07–7.16]; 0.03APACHE II1.21 [1.10–1.33]; < 0.011.21 [1.05–1.38]; 0.011.21 [1.05–1.40]; < 0.01Interleukin-1β at 72 h of admission1.35 [0.93–1.95]; 0.111.48 [1.01–2.18]; 0.04Interleukin 6 at 72 h"

The motor component of the GCS appears to be the most powerful predictor of outcome. Recently, some studies suggested a new model by adding the pupil reactivity score to the motor component of GCS creating the Motor Score-Pupils (MS-P). We aimed to evaluate if MS-P could have a higher impact on the mortality rate than the Glasgow Coma Scale in TBI admitted to the ED.Methods:This observational prospective and analytical cohort study was conducted over 3 years in an universal hospital including patients admitted to the ED for traumatic brain injury. MS-P was calculated at admission by subtracting 0, 1, 2 points of the better motor response evaluated using GCS when pupils were bilaterally responsive, only one responsive and bilaterally irresponsive respectively with a variation of − 1 to 6 points. The primary end-point was the mortality at the ED. ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality.Results:One hundred and fifty six patients were included in our study. The mean age was 39 years [15–88] with a sex ratio of 4.8. The mean GCS was 12.95 [3–15]. The mean motor response was 5.37 [1–6]. The mean MS-P was 5.02 [-1–6]. For the pupils reactivity: 140 (89%) patients had bilateral response, 4 (2.6%) had only one response and 12 (7.7%) had bilateral irresponsive. The mortality at the ED was shown in 12 patients (7.7%). The GCS and MS-P area under the curve for the mortality at the ED were respectively (p= 0.000; AUC = 0.883; 95% CI [0.810–0.957]) and (p= 0.000; AUC = 0.943; 95% CI [0.902–0.983]).Conclusions:GCS and MS-P calculated on admission to the ED could both identify patients with traumatic brain injury at high risk of death. However, MS-P demonstrated useful discrimination and higher AUC value than the GCS for predicting mortality. This funding deserves more research in multicentre studies to be useful.P036 Treatment following intracranial pressure monitoring improves outcome but extends the length of stay: a retrospective analysis of a single centerR Antolini1, G Perini2, F Violini2, A Raponi3, C Pacini2, F Santoni2, E Vitali2, A Salvucci Salice4, A Donati5, A Carsetti51UNIVPM, Ancona, Italy,2UNIVPM, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy,3UNIVPM, Emergency Medicine Residency Program, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy,4UNIVPM, Medicina"

The severity of the head trauma TBI is assessed using the GCS score and it is classified as: severe ≤ 8, moderate 9–13, mild ≥ 14. Treatments include: antiepileptic prophylaxis, management of intracranial hypertension in order to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and ensuring adequate oxygen delivery. The use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has been postulated to be beneficial in patients with severe TBI, although studies investigating this hypothesis have reported conflicting results. The objective of this study is to compare the mortality of the patients treated following ICP monitoring.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed all the patients admitted to our ICU between January 2018 and June 2023. We collected the following variables: gender, age, pre-intubation GCS, whether they underwent neurosurgical decompressive craniotomy, ICP monitoring, AEDs and EEG results, length of stay (LoS) and outcome. For statistical analysis Mann–Whitney-U test was used for comparing medians and Fisher’s test for group comparisons.Results:We included 453 patients, 338 (74%) were male. Median age was 58 [37; 75] years and a median pre-intubation GCS of 8 [6; 13]. 165 (36%) patients have isolated TBI, 133 (29%) had ICP monitoring. The median days of LoS of the patients with ICP monitoring was higher than in the ones without ICP monitoring (14 [8; 22] vs. 8 [4; 13],p< 0.05) but there is a reduction in mortality with odds ratio of 2.11 (95% CI: 0.97, 5.12) [Table]. The same results are obtained by considering the population with GCS ≤ 8.Conclusions:Our study highlights the effectiveness of ICP monitoring in TBI, demonstrating an improvement in clinical outcome despite an extended LoS and possible mortality reduction. These findings emphasize the importance of considering ICP monitoring as pivotal intervention especially in severe TBI management.Table (abstract P036)Patient outcome: comparison between ICP monitoring and no ICP monitoringICP MonitoringNo ICP MonitoringpvalueDischarged from ICU123264< 0.05Dead941P037 Hemoglobin levels, transfusions and outcomes after traumatic brain injury.

Our aim was to describe hemoglobin values and RBC transfusion in TBI admitted to ICU.Methods:Secondary analysis of CENTER-TBI, a multicenter, prospective, observational study on a large cohort of TBI patients. We included all the patients admitted to ICU, with Hb data available at admission and during first week.Results:1385 TBI patients admitted to ICU had a hemoglobin value at baseline (mean ISS 32 (sd = 15). At admission the mean value of hemoglobin was of 12.9 (± 1.9) g/dL decreasing at the end of the first week in ICU, 9.8 (± 1.5) g/dL. Patients with Hb values lower than di 7.5 or 9.5 g/dL were 0.4% (n = 5) and 5.6% (n = 77) while at the end of the first week were 3.7% (n = 24) and 42.6% (n = 276). The median fluids balance over the first week in ICU was 1.08L (QI–QIII = − 0.09 to 3.70). 23% (318) underwent RBC transfusion, with 156 (49%) needing more than 1 unit of RBC. Median Hb values before transfusion were 8.40 g/dL (QI–Q3 = 7.7–9.1) with high variability amongst centers and countries with a range from 5.9 g/dL to 14.3 g/dL and 7.3 g/dL to 14.3 g/dL in centers and countries, respectively. No univocal transfusion policy was identified, with a prevalence of liberal strategy within countries (Figure). No differences in Hb values before transfusion were found between patients with poor and good neurological outcomes (8.44 g/dL, sd = 1.10, and 8.64 g/dL, sd = 1.46,p= 0.166). The same results were obtained when considering mortality at 6 months as an outcome.Conclusions:A reduction of Hb values during first week of ICU admission were observed in our cohort. Hb less than 7.5 g/dL is uncommon in TBI patients and only a low percentage of patient need an RBC transfusion during ICU stay. Transfusion policy is heterogenous and seem not strictly following current guidelines indications. Although Hb values differs among patients, this seems to have not an impact on long term outcome.Figure (abstract P037)Box and whisker plot: values of Hb before transfusion in each country, considering centers with more than 15 observations.

We focused on acute care needs and interventions during the ICU stay, with particular attention to extracranial surgery (ES) performed within the first 48 h. Utilizing a logistic regression model, we assessed potential predictors, including SIs.Results:Out of 1695 patients, 258 (15.2%) underwent ES within the initial 48 h. These patients tended to be younger and had a higher total Injury Severity Scale than those without ES (Table). In a multivariable analysis:- Hypotension alone and both SIs were identified as factors associated with an increased risk of undergoing extracranial surgery within 48 h (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6–4.1,p< 0.001; and OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–3.5,p= 0.005; respectively).- Higher Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores (> 3) in specific extracranial body regions, such as the abdomen and pelvis (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.7–3.5), extremities (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 4.3–8.3), and spine (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9–2.1), were also associated with an elevated risk.- Evaluating GOSE score in patients undergoing ES, we have found both more moderate and disability (34.5% and 33.3% vs. 24.8% and 20.4%), but mortality at 6 months was lower (13.2% vs. 24.1%).Conclusions:The need for surgical interventions increases with the severity of trauma and with Systemic Insults (SIs). This has an impact on clinical outcomes: ES do not increase mortality at 6 months but these patients are more susceptible to an increased disability, both moderate and severe. Identifying these populations at hospital admission could facilitate the healing process and identify their clinical needs.Table (abstract P038)Patient characteristicsOverall (1695)Extracranial surgery (258)No extracranial surgery (1437)pAge (mean (SD))50.41 (19.34)44.15 (17.98)51.54 (19.37)< 0.001Road traffic accident741 (45.2)177 (69.7)564 (40.7)< 0.001Total ISS (mean (SD))33.61 (16.18)45.05 (15.37)31.56 (15.46)< 0.001Classification (%)—both115 ( 6.8)37 (14.3)78 ( 5.4)< 0.001Hypotension142 ( 8.4)50 (19.4)92 ( 6.4)Hypoxia158 ( 9.3)27 (10.5)131 ( 9.1)Mortality % (6 months)380 (22.4)34 (13.2)346 (24.1)< 0.001P039 Study of a large cohort of traumatic spinal cord injury patients attended in intensive care unit during the last 4 yearsI Selva Armadans1, AF"

This condition stands as a leading cause of disability, especially among young people. Our aim was to report the clinical characteristics of patients admitted with TSCI to the Neurotrauma and Rehabilitation Intensive Care Unit at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona (ICU-HVH).Methods:A descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective study was conducted on TSCI patients in the ICU-HVH, utilizing epidemiological, clinical, surgical, and treatment parameters. The clinical evolution of patients was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 3 and 6 months.Results:195 patients (84% males) were treated. Mean age was 51 ± 19 years [14–87], average length of stay was 9 ± 12 days [0–85]. Most common causes were: same level falls (30%), motor vehicle accidents (21%), sports accidents (16%) and, different level falls (13%). Most patients presented cervical spinal cord injuries (69%), of which 63% were incomplete; 30% had thoracic spinal cord injuries, of which 62% were complete (p< 0.005). 45% of cervical TSCI received corticoids. Fracture site stabilization was performed in 90% of patients, annual increase within the first 24 h, increased from 6% in 2019 to 57% in 2022. After 72 h a progressive decrease in surgeries was observed (54–15%;p< 0.001). At 6 months, the percentage of patients with good recovery increased to 27% (p< 0.001). Patients operated on within the first 24 h exhibited a 37% good recovery on the GOS at 3 months (p< 0.001). At 6 months, 13% patients walked without assistance, 3% with crutches or a walker, and 57% used a wheelchair.Conclusions:There is an increasing trend in both the number and early timing of interventions. Early intervention in TSCI patients reflects a better prognosis at 3 months, resulting in lower rehabilitation therapy costs.P040 Examining the predictive effectiveness of ATLS, rTS in polytrauma patients and defining new parameters to be added to trauma scoresS Hosaf1, O Ayvaz1, T Kayım1, E Karakoc2, B Yelken21Eskisehir Osmangazı University, Anaesthesia and Reanimation, Eskisehir, Turkey,2Eskisehir Osmangazı University, Intensive Care Unit, Eskisehir, TurkeyCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P040Introduction:Many scoring systems have been evaluated in predicting mortality and prognosis of trauma patients, but their superiority and reliability over each other are still not sufficient.

Lactate levels for the first 5 days were evaluated. Mann Whitney U-Test was used for comparisons between groups, and chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used for comparisons of categorical variables. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between continuous variables.Results:A total of 4053 patients were treated in the ICU between the specified dates and a total of 96 patients with a diagnosis of polytrauma were included in the study. The median age of the polytrauma patients was 43 and 68.8% (n:66) of them were male. There was statistically significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of APACHE-2, revised trauma score, GCS at admission to ICU, ATLS 10 score, lactate levels at 2, 3, 4 and 5 days. Presence of thoracic trauma and ATLS 10 score were correlated with length of stay in ICU.Conclusions:As we reported that nonsurvivors’ mean GCS points were significantly lower than survivors’, we concluded that a score that designed to predict mortality of polytrauma patients should be mostly dominated by GCS. The predictability of the first 5 days lactate levels should be examined to use as a parameter of a mortality score.P041 Impact of E-FAST and massive transfusion in polytrauma approachAR Simões, M Sequeira, L Simões, L Linhares, E Trigo, P MartinsCentro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço Medicina Intensiva, Coimbra, PortugalCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P041Introduction:Trauma patients frequently suffer hemorrhagic shock and its rapid control impacts the patient’s outcome.

The median time to emergent surgery was 1.97 h. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 42% (40% due to coagulation dysfunction).Conclusions:E-FAST was performed in 31% of patients because TFT protocol only considers its implementation in unstable patients. An effective implementation of MT protocol demands a standardized approach, ongoing education and a continuous review of procedures. The analysis of the total volume of blood products revealed a disparity in relation to the recommended ratio of 1:1:1.

D-dimer (DD) easily measured and considered a good screening tool of coagulation activation. Its increase amount in plasma is a reflection of the extent of hyper coagulopathy. Hence, in trauma, measuring DD levels may be helpful in providing useful prognostic information. So, our study tried to find whether DD levels at the time of admission can be a predictor to the outcome of patients.Methods:This prospective observational study involved 205 adult patients of age group 18–60 years coming to trauma emergency within 24 h of injury and blood samples collected within this period. The primary outcome was to assess whether DD levels at the time of admission predicts outcome. Association of DD levels with injury severity score (ISS), with blunt or penetrating trauma, time from injury to admission (TIA), and to hospital stay were secondary outcomes. Value of DD > 250 ng/mL were considered elevated. For ease of statistical analysis, patients were divided into two groups—ISS < 16 and ISS ≥ 16.

This can be treated with fibrinogen sources, including human fibrinogen concentrate. The aim of this analysis was to extract the data from patients in the FORMA-10 study treated for non-surgical, trauma-related bleeding.Methods:FORMA-10 [1] was a retrospective, observational, non-interventional study in patients with fibrinogen deficiency receiving fibrinogen concentrate (Fibryga®) from December 2017 to February 2020 in 6 study centres in France. The study evaluated real-world use of fibrinogen concentrate for the on-demand treatment of bleeding and in surgical prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the indication and dose for fibrinogen concentrate use, with secondary endpoints including a measure of treatment success. For this sub-analysis, the FORMA-10 datasets were searched to extract available data regarding patients with trauma-related bleeding.Results:FORMA-10 included 8 patients (11.3%) with non-surgical, trauma-related bleeding, comprising 7 males and 1 female, all aged ≥ 18 years.

LEX-209 was a Phase 3 non-inferiority randomized control trial of an investigational 4F-PCC (Octaplex®, Octapharma), which demonstrated hemostatic non-inferiority to the FDA-approved control 4F-PCC (Kcentra®, CSL Behring) in rapid vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal before urgent surgery (p< 0.001).Methods:In LEX-209, patients aged ≥ 18 years on VKA therapy with an international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 2.0 and anticipating significant bleeding risk (≥ 50 mL) were enrolled across 24 United States and European hospitals. Randomized patients (1:1) received a single intravenous 4F-PCC infusion dosed by body weight and baseline INR. Concomitant vitamin K was administered unless VKA anticoagulation was required 24 h post-surgery. The primary endpoint, hemostatic non-inferiority, was evaluated by a blinded Independent Endpoint Adjudication Board using a surgeon-assessed objective scale. Additional endpoints included INR correction and safety.Results:Baseline characteristics were comparable between investigational (n = 105) and control (n = 103) groups. Median 4F-PCC dose was 25 IU/kg (both groups). Most patients received concomitant vitamin K (75.2% investigational; 68.9% control).

Despite DOACs being used in clinical practice for over 10 years there is still no readily available and accredited laboratory test to assess the anticoagulative effect of the different concentrations of different DOACs. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a widespread point-of-care instrument that has the potential to be used for this assessment. The primary aim was to investigate how the ROTEM variable clotting time (CT) in the EXTEM assay was affected by increasing concentrations of rivaroxaban. Secondary aims were to evaluate the impact of different concentrations of rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban on the ROTEM variables CT, clot formation time (CFT) and α-angle.Methods:Blood from twelve healthy volunteers for each DOAC was spiked to anticipated concentrations between 0 and 1000 µg/L. These different concentrations were analyzed in four different ROTEM assays (INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM and HEPTEM). CT, CFT and α-angle were measured in each assay. Chromogenic anti-IIa and anti-Xa assays were used to determine the actual concentration of the modified samples.Results:The concentrations of all three"

Rivaroxaban presented a significant increase in CT-EXTEM for the 200–1000 µg/L concentration compared to baseline. CFT and α-angle were affected mostly in supratherapeutic concentrations and primarily in the INTEM assay for all the tested DOACs.Conclusions:We demonstrated that CT-EXTEM was affected by the increasing concentrations of rivaroxaban with a linear dose-dependent prolongation. CT in the other ROTEM assays was also affected in a similar manner while the impact on increasing DOAC concentrations on CFT and α-angle were not significant. In clinical practice, CT can be used as a surrogate marker for DOAC concentration.Figure (abstract P046)Linear regression of clotting time (CT) value depending on actual concentration of DOAC in EXTEM-, FIBTEM-, INTEM- and HEPTEM-assays.

The reliability of such indicators remains to be determined. We used the dataset of P-OpTTICCA (NCT03871244) to study the impact of RBC transfusions on physiological parameters suggestive of anemia intolerance and the need for a RBC transfusion.Methods:P-OpTTICCA was a pilot randomized controlled trial conducted in 4 PICUs in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Patients were allocated to an Hb threshold of 70 g/L (intervention arm) or to usual care (controls). Hb and five physiological parameters that can suggest anemia intolerance (PaO2, FiO2, PaO2/FiO2ratio, ScvO2and blood lactate) were collected prospectively.Results:The data of the two RCT arms were merged, given that all demographic baseline data and outcomes were similar in the two arms. We included 120 patients (median age: 75.0 ± 72.2 months) of whom 68 (56.7%) were male and 46 (38.3%) under mechanical ventilation. In the cohort, 39 (32.5%) were transfused for a total of 89 RBC transfusions, and 81 (67.6%) were not. Both PaO2/FiO2ratio and ScvO2were higher before the 1st transfusion in the transfused group than during the entire PICU stay in the non-transfused patients (p= 0.003 andp= 0.0041). Blood lactate was similar. The change of physiological parameters measured before and after the 1st RBC transfusion in those 39 transfused participants, showed an increased Hb concentration (∆: + 22.0 ± 15.3 g/L,p< 0.001) and a decreased blood lactate[1.8 ± 2.5–1.5 ± 1.8 mmol/L, (p= 0.07)] even though it was"

However, there are limited data on the prevalence and significance of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of DIC in COVID-19 and test the hypothesis that DIC is independently associated with a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.Methods:A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted using large-scale COVID-19 registry data from hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The patients were classified into DIC and non-DIC groups based on the diagnosis on admission (day 1) and the diagnosis on any of days 1, 4, 8, and 15.Results:A total of 23,054 patients were included and were divided into 264 DIC patients and 22,790 non-DIC patients on day 1. A total of 1654 patients diagnosed with DIC on any of the days 1 to 15 were divided into 181 DIC patients and 1473 non-DIC patients. The prevalence of DIC on day 1 was 1.1%, which increased to 10.9% by day 15. The diagnosis of DIC on day 1 had moderate predictive performance for the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) on day 4 and in-hospital death, and was independently associated with MODS and in-hospital death. The diagnosis of DIC on days 1 to 15, especially those diagnosed with DIC on days 8 and 15, was associated with a lower survival probability in comparison to patients without DIC and it also showed a significant association with in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients.Conclusions:While it is not common, DIC, particularly when occurring later in the course, significantly contributes to the development of a poor prognosis in individuals with COVID-19.P049 Effects of therapeutic anticoagulation and high dose dexamethasone on mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)K Cistera1, J Swartz1, J Alhashemi21Lakeshore General Hospital, Respiratory Therapy, Pointe Claire, Canada,2Lakeshore General Hospital, Anesthesiology, Pointe Claire, CanadaCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P049Introduction:Therapeutic anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia remains controversial.

Adults admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction were included. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or admitted to the ICU for reasons other than COVID-19 pneumonia. Participants received high-dose intravenous (IV) dexamethasone and therapeutic anticoagulation with IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin for a total of 28 days, or until ICU discharge, whichever came first. Outcomes included ICU mortality and length of stay (LOS). Chi-square and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used for mortality and LOS analyses. A stepwise binary logistic regression analysis used ICU mortality as the dependent variable while the independent variables were anticoagulation, bleeding, renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.

Volume management remain controversial this study aims to describe fluid resuscitation and describe an association between sub-optimal or excessive fluid administration and the incidence of early AKI (eAKI).Methods:Retrospective cohort study. Registry data for adults admitted to Burn ICU after electrical injury, between 2007 and 2013 was analyzed. The primary outcome was eAKI. Incidence was modeled using multivariable logistic regression, including age, sex, TBSA, time to treat, and creatine phosphokinase maximum (CPKmax). CPK, fluid requirements, and urine output (UO) were recorded on days 0–6 of admission. The protocol targets were UO > 1.5 mL/kg/h in rhabdomyolysis or > 2 mL/kg/h if myoglobinuria were present.Results:456 patients were included, median TBSA was 5% (2–12%), 27 patients (5,9%) developed eAKI. There were no significant differences in age, sex, CPK, or CPKmax value. Volume infused in 0–2 days was lower in the eAKI group, with no significant differences regarding hourly resuscitation volume. The UO0 and UO1 (mL/hr) were significantly lower in the eAKI group (37.9 vs. 139.1 mL/hr,p< 0.001 and 162.0 vs. 187.6 mL/hr,p= 0.005 respectively). The UO0 was the only variable associated with the development of eAKI (OR 0.984, 95% CI 0.976–0.992).Conclusions:Neither the time to treat nor the fluid volume of resuscitation are associated with the development of eAKI in electrical injuries. Crystalloid infusion guided by urinary output may result in a lower incidence of eAKI.ReferencesDépret F et al. Burns. 2018;44:1887–94Wu G et al.

The incidence of immediate complications is estimated at 6.8% [1, 2]. Long term risks include infection, air embolism and extravasation [3]. Guidelines to reduce the latter are not yet widely established and incidence may be as high as 39% in adults [4]. This project aimed to improve the care of CVADs on Critical Care, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with extravasation.Methods:Data were collected prospectively over 3 days in 2023 at an adult 100-bed intensive care unit. An audit in 2019 demonstrated sub-optimal port selection, and guidelines were introduced recommending that CVP should be transduced from the proximal and high-risk drugs given via the distal ports. To check adherence, every CVAD was considered a separate event. Data were collected regarding site, method of securing, medications administered and transducer location. Events were excluded if CVADs were inserted elsewhere or if data were incomplete. Any vasoactive drugs or those with high osmotic potential were considered high-risk.Results:127 CVADs were observed. 65% (n = 82) central venous catheters (CVCs) and 35% (n = 45) temporary dialysis catheters. Regarding CVCs, most (68%) were in the right internal jugular vein (IJV). 7% were transduced through the proximal port (6% in 2019) with 56% through the distal port (77% in 2019) and 13% not transduced. 28% (n = 23) had high-risk drugs administered through the proximal port (41% in 2019). 27% (n = 96) of high-risk drugs were infused proximally. 87% (n = 82) were sutured to the skin (21% not secured in 2019).Conclusions:Despite some improvement with fewer CVADs transduced distally and fewer high-risk drugs proximally, port-choice remains suboptimal.ReferencesWong AV et al.

Regarding pain chronification, only 12.5% of patients experienced this issue post-discharge.Conclusions:The study demonstrates the potential of LRAA in improving clinical outcomes for thoracic trauma patients in the ICU, particularly in reducing the need for IMV and shortening ICU stays. The findings suggest that early application of LRAA can be beneficial, although more research is needed to understand its full impact, especially on patients who still require IMV after LRAA.Acknowledgement:The first and second authors contributed equally to this work.P057 Description of pharmacologic pain control using the analgesia nociception index monitor during the performance of noninvasive procedures in adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unitC Catalán, A Cañas, J Tello, A Ulloa, C Díaz, J ContrerasClinica Alemana, Intensive Care Unit, Santiago, ChileCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P057Introduction:This study examines ANI variations during noninvasive ICU procedures in mechanically ventilated patients. Primary objective: To analyze ANI levels before, during, and after procedures. Secondary objectives: to categorize analgesic responses and classify regimens for pain management in the absence of a gold standard for ICU pain assessment.Methods:Prospective study in 2 ICUs, Jan–Sep 2023, aimed to detect 10-point ANI difference between different times. Data from 76 patients collected. Ethical approval granted without informed consent.Results:Significant differences in ANIi were observed before, during and after the procedures. At rest, while CPOT indicated the presence of 1/85 measurements with moderate pain, ANIi identified 16 situations with pain (< 50), adequate analgesia in 25 and 44 (> 70) with analgesic overdose (Figure). During the procedures, ANIi values decreased significantly and returned to baseline values by time 2. The relationship between ANIi values and CPOT had significant differences, such as the use of analgesics, sedatives that showed significant correlations, such as the RASS sedation scale. Fentanyl did not show significant differences, but its association with other analgesics would allow a reduction in its dose.Conclusions:ANI detects nociceptive stimuli during non-invasive procedures and reveals variability in analgesic dosing [1]. ANI makes visible situations of clinical importance, such as analgesic overdose, allowing for adjustment"

Opioids remain the first line and although regional analgesia (RA) is expanding, its role in the ICU is yet to be proven.Methods:We aimed to describe and evaluate the role of RA for the critically ill CT patient. A retrospective cohort study of all CT patients admitted to a Portuguese tertiary’s hospital ICU was conducted. Patients’ demographics, analgesia modalities and opioid consumption measured in oral morphine milligram equivalents were assessed. RA was compared to standard analgesia (SA) and we considered T0 as the average time of RA initiation. Pain and opioid consumption were evaluated 24 h before T0 and five days later.Results:119 patients were included, mainly male (83%), a mean age of 50 years. Mean severity scores: SAPS 31(± 16), TRISS 36 (± 27). Mean ICU and hospital stay were 11 (± 11) and 29 (± 30) days respectively. Only 7% presented isolated CT and traumatic brain injury was the most frequent associated trauma (61%). 44% required invasive mechanical ventilation for a mean duration of 14 days, 16% developed respiratory nosocomial infection and 2.5% died in hospital. RA was used in 48.7% of CT patients. Thoracic epidural (TE) was the most common form of RA used (71%) followed by continuous erector spinae block (29%). RA reached a statistically significant reduction in opioid consumption (− 186 ± 1200 vs. − 103 ± 533,p= 0.028) compared to SA. Reduction reached statistical difference only for the TE subgroup. No significant differences were found between RA and SA and between both strategies of RA. Two minor TE associated complications were observed.Conclusions:RA, mainly TE, is feasible, safe and offers a meaningful reduction in opioid consumption in CT patients despite no significant impact on other"

Postoperative pain can increase the level of disturbed postoperative cerebral and cardiovascular autoregulation. Well-established perioperative pain control can improve cardiovascular stability and reduce the use of antihypertensive drugs. We studied how the efficacy of the cervical plexus superficial nerve block lateral, single injection vs ultrasound-guided cervical plexus nerve block application, as anaesthetic technique, influenced cardiovascular stability and pain control in the first 4 postoperative hours.Methods:Fifty patients in the ASA III classification undergoing CEA under general anaesthesia) were randomised in two groups. Group I received ultrasound-guided superficial cervical plexus nerve block, while Group II received cervical plexus superficial nerve block, single injection without ultrasound. Postoperative evaluation was performed for 4 h: cardiovascular—mean blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse pressure (PP) and level of pain (numerical pain scale, NPS) and postoperative complications such as myocardial infarction, or postoperative neurologic deficits. On admission to the intensive care unit, the patient received acetaminophen 1 g q6h and an additional painkiller on demand.Results:There were no statistical significances among groups regarding MAP. HR was significantly lower in the non-US group. PP was increased to the third postoperative hour, while in the US group it was not significantly increased until the second hour and then it decreased. In the US-guided group a better pain control could be seen. The variation of pain in the non-US group was significantly different over time and in comparison with the US group.Conclusions:In this study, there were no mortalities or neurological deficits. There was no difference in blood pressure changes. US-guided analgesia provided better pain control.P060 A comparison of droperidol 5 mg and 10 mg for acute agitation in the emergency departmentK GlassHennepin Healthcare, Pharmacy, Minneapolis, USACritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P060Introduction:Droperidol is commonly used in the emergency department (ED) to treat acute agitation.

Intramuscular (IM) droperidol has been shown to be as effective as midazolam, ziprasidone, and lorazepam in reducing duration of violent behavior without significant differences in incidence of QTc prolongation [1–3]. The efficacy of IM droperidol at various doses (5 mg and 10 mg) was further investigated in this study.Methods:This single-center, retrospective study examined adult patients in the ED who received either IM droperidol 5 mg or 10 mg as the first agent for treatment of acute agitation between 01 Jan. 2007 and 30 Jun. 2023. The primary objective was the need for rescue sedation within 1 h of initial droperidol dose. Secondary outcomes included the need for rescue sedation during the entire ED encounter, ED length of stay, and adverse events due to droperidol (hypoxemia, prolonged QTc, or cardiovascular events).Results:In the preliminary analysis, 100 patients received IM droperidol 5 mg and 100 patients received IM droperidol 10 mg. In the droperidol 5 mg group, 26.6% of patients required rescue sedation within 1 h of receiving droperidol, compared with 35% of patients in the droperidol 10 mg group. The average ED length of stay was 7.9 h for droperidol 5 mg and 9 h for droperidol 10 mg.Conclusions:Droperidol 10 mg for treatment of acute agitation may not result in less rescue sedation needed or shorter ED lengths of stay compared to droperidol 5 mg. However, this may be in part due to baseline levels of agitation resulting in provider preference when selecting droperidol doses.ReferencesCole JB et al.

Previous retrospective studies involving mixed ICU populations have found continuation rates ranging from 21 to 61% at hospital discharge for antipsychotics (AP) started in the ICU for dl [2–3]. Admission to the surgical ICU was cited as a risk factor for continuation of AP though no further descriptions of AP continuation have been described [3]. The continuation rate of AP was evaluated in a level 1 trauma academic medical center.Methods:This single-center, retrospective study examined adult surgical ICU patients admitted for trauma from 01 May 2020 to 31 May 2023. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a history of select psychiatric disorders or were in the ICU for less than 48 h. Prior AP use was noted, and escalation was described as new AP use. The rates of dl and agitation were recorded to assess the indication for AP initiation. Of secondary interest, the rate of clonidine use for dexmedetomidine withdrawal was described.Results:Preliminary results show of the 226 patients included, 59% were started on AP. Of these 133 patients, 71% were continued on AP at ICU discharge and 55% were continued at hospital discharge. Clonidine was initiated in 28 patients and continued in 10 patients at hospital discharge. Of patients on AP, 46% were discharged to acute rehabilitation, 35% to home, and 18% to long term care.

HR, MAP, and sedation score (RASS) were measured 8-hourly; plasma was sampled to determine clonidine concentrations. Individual clonidine concentrations were predicted using a pharmacokinetic model [1], to serve as input for the pharmacodynamic models. NONMEM was used to derive linear effect models for HR and MAP and logistic models for sedation. The models were evaluated and validated by goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrapping and visual predictive checks.Results:For the models of HR and MAP, 783 measurements were combined with predicted clonidine concentrations. HR was described by a linear effect model with a baseline of 90.6 bpm (relative standard error (RSE) 2%), clonidine concentrations. and a slope of − 3.30 bpm per µg/L clonidine (RSE 10%). MAP was described by a linear effect model with a baseline of 76.9 mmHg (RSE 2%), and a slope of − 0.887 mmHg per µg/L (RSE 42%).

We aimed to investigate the effect of Dx on myocardial ischemia in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) in non-cardiac surgery.Methods:Patients with IHD who will be operated for peripheral vascular surgery were included in the study. They were allocated into 2 groups: the Dx group (GDx) and the midazolam (Md) group (GMd). In both groups, standard lumbar epidural anesthesia was performed. For sedation, Dx (0.6 mcg/kg/h) was used in GDx, whereas Md (0.025–0.05 mg/kg/h) was used in GMd during the operation. Patients’ characteristics, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, Tn-I levels (preop, postop 8th, 24th, and 48th h), and ECG changes were recorded.Results:Patients’ characteristics and preoperative Tn-I levels in GDx (n = 23) and GMd (n = 24) were similar. During the operation, the Ramsey Scale in GDx (2 ± 0.3) was significantly lower than in GMd (3 ± 0.3) (p< 0.001). Also, heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in GDx were significantly lower than in GMd (for allp< 0.001). In the first 24 h of the postoperative period, the numbers of ischemic episodes in both groups were similar (GDx:4 and GMd:8,p= 0.052). However, the duration of ischemic episodes in GDx (2.4 ± 0.9 min) was significantly shorter than in GMd (5.4 ± 1.2 min) (p< 0.001).

The CAMI score (China Acute Myocardial Infarction) has proven its predictive value for mortality as well as major cardiovascular events, in Chinese patients and subsequently in other populations presenting with STEMI but has never been evaluated in the prediction of fibrinolysis failure. The aim of our study was to determine the predictive value of CAMI score in fibrinolysis failure.Methods:This was a prospective, observational and prognostic study conducted from January 2022 until May 2023, including patients who received fibrinolytic treatment with alteplase or tenecteplase for STEMI in the emergency room. The CAMI score, calculated for all patients, was simplified by eliminating the biological parameters (white blood cells and creatinine) to adapt it to the urgency of decision between thrombolysis and primary angioplasty. The score varies from 0 to 181.Results:During the study period, 54 patients received fibrinolysis among 122 patients admitted to the emergency room with STEMI. The mean age was 60 ± 13 years. The sex ratio was 2.6; among these patients, 16.7% had known coronary artery disease of which 77.7% had previously undergone primary angioplasty, lysis failure was observed in 46.3% of patients, four patients presented with cardiogenic shock and three patients died in the emergency room. The predictive fibrinolysis failure value of the CAMI score was statistically tested and the results were significant (p= 0.004), as well as by analyzing the ROC curve (p= 0.004; air under the curve = 0.73; CI [0.59–0.86]).

Building upon the success in cardiac surgery, we extended ERAS-CS to our intensive care units (ICUs) at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.Methods:Our approach faced specific challenges in the critical care setting. Early extubation (in the first 6 h) and early mobilization, defined as sitting in a chair for the first post-extubation meal, also implementing multimodal analgesia (locoregional anesthesia) with early daily opioid cessation assessment. We have also lowered our thoracic chest tube removal thresholds. Here, we present the preliminary results on ICU outcomes of the above measures in the first 50 ERAS patients received as part of the quality control for the certification process.Results:86% versus 88% of patients were extubated in the two groups (NS). Early mobilization on Day 0 and Day 1 reached 83% in ERAS versus 60% before (p= 0.05). Opioid use at day three was noted in 30% of ERAS patients versus 50% before (p= 0.04) with the same value of mean, median and maximum pain level assessed by visual analogue scale during the first three days.

A single center cohort studyF Dogrul, W Vandenberghe, E HosteGhent University Hospital, Ghent University, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ghent, BelgiumCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P070Introduction:Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is influenced by both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. In this study we evaluated the association between the modifiable factors mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and mean perfusion pressure calculated as MAP-CVP (MPP) measured in the first 4 h (h) after intensive care unit (ICU) admission with the development of CSA-AKI within 72 h after cardiac surgery.Methods:In this single center cohort study we collected data in adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery during a 5-year period (2012–2017). Exclusion criteria were cardiac transplantation, and use of ECMO or LVAD. We recorded baseline characteristics and MAP, CVP and MPP values during the first 4 h after ICU admission. The primary endpoint was CSA-AKI within 72 h according the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition based on both serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output (UO) criteria. We used Mann–Whitney and Chi2 test to compare groups, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) and a logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association of the hemodynamic variables with CSA-AKI.Results:A total of 3415 patients were included. CSA-AKI occurred in 2200 patients (64.4%). CSA-AKI patients were older, had more severe Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and had a higher Euroscore II. More CSA-AKI patients had emergency surgery, and combined CABG and valve surgery (allp< 0.001). Patients with CSA-AKI had lower MAP (71 vs. 72 mmHg,p< 0.001), higher CVP (10 vs. 9 mmHg,p< 0.001) and lower MPP (60 vs. 62 mmHg,p< 0.001) compared with patients without AKI. This association remained after adjustment for other risk factors (Table). ROC analysis showed that there was a weak association of lower MAP, higher CVP and lower MPP with CSA-AKI (Table).Conclusions:Small changes in MAP, CVP and MPP during the first 4 h in the ICU were associated with CSA-AKI, even after adjustment for covariates. This association was weak for all 3 variables.Table (abstract P070)Association of hemodynamic variables during the first 4 h of ICU admission and CSA-AKI"

We aimed to investigate whether M-ATRIA-RS had a higher discrimination than CHA2DS2-VASc and than the ATRIA-RS for predicting mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation (FA).Methods:This observational, prospective and analytical cohort study was conducted over 2 years, in an universal hospital, including patients admitted to the ED for atrial fibrillation. The ATRIA-RS, the m-ATRIA-RS (defined as a change in sex points of ATRIA RS from female to male) and the CHA2DS2VASc score were calculated at the admission for all patients. The primary end-point was the in-hospital mortality. ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality.Results:One hundred and fifty one patients were included in our study. The mean age was 67 years old [35–95] with a sex ratio of 0.62. The mean heart rate was 134 ± 24 pm. The mean CHA2DS2VASc score was 2.76 [0–7]. The mean ATRIA-RS and M-ATRIA-RS were respectively 4.52 [0–12] and 4.3 [0–11]. Forty patients (9.4%) died at the ED. The CHA2DS2VASc score, the ATRIA-RS and the m ATRIA-RS area under the curve for predicting in-hospital mortality were respectively (p= 0.002; AUC = 0.758; 95% CI [0.614–0.903]), (p= 0.001; AUC = 0.773; 95% CI [0.612–0.934]) and (p= 0.000; AUC = 0.817; 95% CI [0.682–0.952]).Conclusions:M-ATRIA-RS is useful to predict in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized with AF after the period of COVID-19. It is superior to ATRIA-RS and to CHA2DS2-VASc-RS in predicting mortality for patients with AF.P072 Preload responsiveness cannot be detected by micro-fluid challenge assessed by bioreactanceN De Vita, R Shi, C Bruscagnin, D Rosalba, F Gavelli, A Pavot, C Lai, JL Teboul, X MonnetHôpital de Bicêtre, Hôpitaux Universitaires Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR_S999, Université Paris-Saclay, AP-HP,"

Different monitoring tools have been used to assess the efficacy of this test. Bioreactance has been proposed as a non-invasive method to measure cardiac output and to assess fluid responsiveness. We thus aim to test the ability of bioreactance to measure the changes in cardiac output induced by the rapid infusion of 50 mL of fluid.Methods:In patients with acute circulatory failure, we rapidly infused 50 mL of saline over 30 s (micro-fluid challenge). We measured cardiac index by calibrated pulse contour analysis (PCCI) (PiCCO2, Getinge) and BioCI by bioreactance (Starling,Baxter). Preload responsiveness was defined by an increase in PCCI during a passive leg raising (PLR) test ≥ 10%.Results:We included 46 patients, with mean age of 59 ± 15 years. The main reason of ICU admission was septic shock 28 (61%). There were 15 (33%) preload responders versus 31 (67%) preload non-responders. PCCI increased during PLR by 16 ± 4% in preload responders and by 2 ± 6% in non-responders (p< 0.001). Micro-fluid challenge-induced changes in PCCI were significantly different among preload responders and non-responders (2 ± 9% vs. 0 ± 2%, respectively;p= 0.04). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of micro-fluid challenge assessed by PCCI to detect preload responsiveness was 0.607 (0.433–0.781). Changes in BioCI during PLR and the micro-fluid challenge were not different between responders and non-responders (PLR: 8 ± 16% vs.11 ± 17%, respectively,p= 0.9; micro-fluid challenge: 2 ± 7% vs. 3 ± 10%, respectively,p= 0.78). The AUROC for the micro-fluid challenge assessed by bioreactance to detect preload responsiveness was 0.481 (0.308–0.655).Conclusions:In patients with acute circulatory failure, preliminary results suggests that micro-fluid challenge is not a reliable method for predicting preload responsiveness, neither when assessed by pulse contour analysis, nor by bioreactance.

Patients < 18 years old and those with chronic kidney disease, abdominal surgery and contraindications for PLR test, i.e., brain and spinal injury, were excluded. Ultrasonography assessment of IRVF patterns was obtained within 24 h (Day 1) and at 48-72 h following ICU admission (Day 3). At the time point of IRVF assessment, evaluation of fluid responsiveness was performed by a PLR test while measuring left ventricular outflow tract velocity–time integral (LVOT-VTI) via transthoracic echocardiography. An LVOT-VTI increase ≥ 10% was considered fluid responsiveness [2]. Fluid balance was recorded.Results:A total of 56 mechanically ventilated patients [median age 62.5 (53–72) years, SOFA score 9 (8–12), 60% males, admission diagnosis: 53 (94.6%) medical and 3 (5.4%) surgical], were included. Fluid responsiveness on Days 1 and 3 were not associated with cumulative fluid balance or IRVF pattern. The difference in fluid responsiveness between the 2 days was inversely associated with the difference in fluid balance (p= 0.013), and the difference in the IRVF pattern (p= 0.008). Multiple regression revealed that the difference in fluid responsiveness was independently associated with the difference in IRVF pattern (RR = − 1.64, 95% CI − 3.07, − 0.21,p= 0.024).Conclusions:In ICU patients, fluid responsiveness during the first 3 days following admission was not associated with cumulative fluid balance nor with IRVF pattern.

The primary outcome was the time to successful extubation. To take into account the variation in deresuscitation decision overtime, we used a marginal structural model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).Results:Among 757 patients, 380 patients (50.2%) underwent an early deresuscitation strategy, 201 patients (26.6%) a delayed one and 176 (23.2%) did not undergo any deresuscitation. After checking the distribution of weights and covariate balance in groups, the Cox marginal structural model showed that the delayed deresuscitation was associated with reduced time to extubation. The hazard ratio for extubation was 1.86 [1.33–2.61](p< 0.0003) for the delayed group compared to the early one. The risk of occurrence of a composite outcome including ‘death’ or ‘RRT dependency’ or ‘absence of renal recovery’ at day 60 did not differ between groups.Conclusions:In patients with septic shock and severe AKI, a deresuscitation initiated before vasopressor weaning was associated with increase duration of MV.P075 Perioperative fluid management in critically ill surgical intra-abdominal septic shock and outcome: SIASS-F-III STUDY (effect of preoperative and intraoperative vasopressor)S Kongsayreepong1, T Jaroensri1, N Deeprasert2, S Visuthisakchai21Department of Anesthesiology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Bangkok, Thailand,2Department of Anesthesiology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, ThailandCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P075Introduction:In septic shock, fluid overload caused more complications while restricted fluid did not improve outcome.

However, recent studies did not observe the same effect of landiolol, which is a β1-superselective ultra short-acting intravenous agent. Our study aims to compare landiolol and esmolol regarding their performance in treating tachycardia and impact on the prognosis of critically ill patients.Methods:This is a single center, retrospective cohort study. Patients with tachycardia who were treated with esmolol or landiolol without any other anti-arrhythmia drugs were included. Data were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University from 06/2016 to 12/2022. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the baseline differences. The primary outcome is 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes include heart rate reduction, hemodynamic stability, the ICU length of stay (ICULOS), and the hospital length of stay (HLOS).Results:In total, 558 patients (372 in Esmolol vs. 186 in Landiolol) were included after PSM. The median age was 63 (IQR: 52–74) years old with 31% males. The main reason for ICU admission was follow-up after major surgery (62.4%), with the median SOFA score of 8 (IQR: 6–9). Among them, 45.2% had a sepsis/septic shock.

Since echocardiographic LV dysfunction presents before change in cardiac biomarkers, we have developed a tool for continuous monitoring of mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE). This method uses deep learning to automatically estimate MAPSE on transesophageal echocardiographic images obtained in a hands-free manner (autoMAPSE). Our aim was to test the ability of continuous autoMAPSE in predicting the subsequent release of the two cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T (TnT).Methods:We monitored 50 patients for two hours after cardiac surgery. Every 5 min, we recorded mean arterial pressure, heart rate and autoMAPSE. Every 40 min, we obtained arterial and central venous blood gasses. We also performed one echocardiographic exam at the beginning or the end of the protocol. ProBNP and TnT were repetedly measured postoperatively from ICU arrival to the first postoperative evening and summarized by their respective area under the curve. The hemodynamic parameters and autoMAPSE were summarized by their respective time-weighted averages (TWA). Finally, we divided the patients into two groups by the median of autoMAPSE and compared proBNP and TnT.Results:Continuous autoMAPSE was feasible in 48 patients (96%). Of all the parameters, the TWA of autoMAPSE was the only one that correlated significantly with both proBNP and TnT (Table). In the two groups defined by median autoMAPSE, both proBNP and TnT were significantly different by t-test (p< 0.01 andp< 0.05, respectively).Conclusions:The TWA of autoMAPSE in the two first postoperative hours predicted the next day release of both proBNP and TnT.

We have developed a method for continuous monitoring of LV function by automatically obtaining mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) using deep learning in transesophageal echocardiographic images (autoMAPSE). As MAPSE reflects load-dependent contraction, we hypothesize that the clinical behavior of autoMAPSE reflects VA coupling.Methods:We explored the relationship between autoMAPSE and VA coupling in 50 ICU patients after cardiac surgery. We approached VA coupling in two ways. The first was by exploring the relationship between MAPSE and mean arterial pressure (MAP) within each patient. For this, we recorded autoMAPSE and MAP every 5 min for two hours. We then assessed the within-patient MAPSE/MAP-relationship using a mixed linear model with random slopes and intercepts. We quantified this relationship with the intra-class correlation. The second approach was by estimating VA coupling as the ratio between effective arterial elastance and end-systolic elastance (Ea/Ees-ratio). Using transesophageal echocardiography, we estimated end-systolic elastance noninvasively and effective arterial elastance as (0.9 × systolic arterial pressure)/stroke volume.Results:We found a strong within-patient MAPSE/MAP-relationship with highly significant random slopes (intra-class correlation = 0.81,p< 0.001). This MAPSE/MAP-relationship varied between patients, indicated by the different slopes for each patient (Figure). There was a significant correlation"

After connection of the CCIMBAdevice (evaluated method) to the bedside monitor, paired CCIMBAand CCIPCAwere recorded prior to (baseline replicate) and during the PLR and/or FC (maximum replicate, i.e. highest value). Fluid responsiveness was identified if the relative change in CCIPCAbetween baseline and maximum replicates (∆%25CCIPCA) was > 10% during PLR and > 15% during FC. Bias of paired data was evaluated using all replicates, and the trending ability using 4-quadrant and radial plots. ∆%25CCIMBAoptimal threshold during PLR to predict fluid responsiveness (∆%25CCIPCA> 15% during FC) was estimated using the receiver-operating curve (AUROC).Results:29 patients (median 68 [IQR: 57–74] yo, SOFA 12 [8–14]) received 28 PLR and 16 FC. CCIMBAand CCIPCAwere significantly correlated (R2= 0.73).

We designed an electronic survey to better understand current practice and alignment with these guidelines, in intensive care units (ICUs) in Portugal.Methods:A short questionnaire was shared on social networks or via email (e-blast) by the Portuguese Society of Critical Care from May 11th to September 11th 2023 to answer 24 questions about hemodynamic monitoring and management in the ICU.Results:Globally, 174 valid questionnaires were available for analysis. 54% were intensive care specialists, and the rest were in training. For the patient in septic shock, the volume of fluid challenge differed between 500 mL (42%), 250 mL (30.5%), and 1000 mL (19%), and the most used type of fluid used was balanced solution (85.5% vs 14.4% saline). The main criteria for starting vasopressors were a MAP ≤ 65 mmHg after 30 mL/kg of fluids and peripheral perfusion compromise (77.6%), with norepinephrine being universally the first choice. For the second vasopressor, 66.1% chose vasopressin. The most frequently used tools to assess fluid responsiveness were the evaluation of IVC (52.3%), cardiac output by echocardiography (45.4%), and PPV measurement (44.8%). The hemodynamic monitoring devices most used by the responders were echocardiography (97.1%), transpulmonary thermodilution system (82.2%), and pulmonary artery catheter (45.4%).Conclusions:Our survey suggests that most patients in septic shock in Portuguese ICUs receive fluids, norepinephrine, and vasopressin, according to current recommendations.

Focused echo is increasingly used in critical care to aid management and diagnosis of shock syndromes, fluid tolerance and cardiac output assessment. Effective governance is essential to ensure its appropriate use and interpretation. Key to the governance of echo is the ability to access and review images of scans. UK guidelines state that focused echo images should be stored in a location other than on the machine [1]. Use of portable ultrasound machines to undertake focused echo can impede this.Methods:We undertook a baseline audit in May 2023. Data was collected for 1 month and all focused echos carried out on the critical care unit were included. Scans performed purely for accreditation purposes were excluded. Interventions were to present the findings of this audit at a departmental meeting, arrange for all echo and ultrasound machines to upload scans to our institution’s online echo database and introduce a monthly echo governance meeting. The audit was then repeated in October 2023.Results:31 focused echos were performed in each 1-month cycle. The majority of scans (76%) were performed using portable ultrasound machines and almost half of all echos were performed out of hours. Our interventions increased the ability to review echo images online from 39 to 71% (Figure). The greatest area of improvement was seen in out of hours echos where this improved from 25 to 67% of scans. Scans with a documented report improved slightly from 65 to 71%.Conclusions:Connecting all echo and ultrasound machines to our institutions echo database and the introduction of a focused echo governance meeting greatly increased the proportion of focused echos with images available to review online. This not only improved compliance with UK guidelines but also greatly increased opportunities for echo governance.ReferenceFaculty of Intensive Care Medicine.

However, training in POCUS within ICU is variable by unit and often ad hoc leading to a lack of confidence among trainee doctors and Advanced critical care practitioners (ACCPs) to use this modality at the bedside. We, therefore, sought to create a teaching programme to increase confidence in using POCUS and extend knowledge.Methods:We created a weekly peer-led teaching programme on POCUS. We use a hybrid format with a small group tutorial available to join online or in person, followed by practical scanning. This was designed to increase both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice for skills in the acquisition and understanding of images. We surveyed the staff attending to monitor changes in self-reported level of knowledge and confidence. We also sought feedback on the quality of the sessions and had an adaptive program so we could change the session format or content accordingly.Results:So far, each session has been attended by 4–11 trainee doctors and ACCPs. We have found consistent improvement in self-reported knowledge of POCUS, confidence in obtaining POCUS images, and interpretation of images. Furthermore, the mode has increased substantially for each category showing a growing skew towards confidence within the group. There has also been complimentary feedback about the sessions and repeated attendance for both online and in-person teaching.Conclusions:Overall, we have found that providing a dedicated weekly peer-led teaching session about ultrasound for trainee doctors and ACCPs in ICU has increased overall knowledge and confidence in using POCUS. This has benefits for both the individual clinicians' further professional development but also patients having increased access to enthusiastic clinicians with improved training in POCUS.P084 Setting up an echocardiography teaching and governance meeting within critical care in a district general hospitalM Sheikh, M Smith, P ParulekarWilliam Harvey Hospital, Critical Care, Ashford, UKCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P084Introduction:We looked at the feasibility of introducing an echo governance meeting in a district general hospital.

The Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) software is a machine learning algorithm that detects early hemodynamic instability that may lead to hypotension. The original validation of HPI used a case control analysis and excluded data from a zone of uncertainty (grey zone) [1]. It is important that clinically used algorithms reflect the use of data in a real-world setting. We therefore conducted a clinically framed analysis of the ability of HPI.Methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 9 previously reported studies.

It has been suggested that MAP can be used to predict hypotension [1]. Hypotension is a condition where flow to local organs is disrupted leading to hypoperfusion, but it is often defined with simple arbitrary thresholds of MAP. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of mathematical coupling on ROC analysis when MAP is used to predict hypotension.Methods:A total of 2022 patients yielding 4,152,124 datapoints were used to construct ROCs for MAP, SV and HR to predict a decrease of themselves for random thresholds 10 min into the future. The patient data are from 9 published studies. Additionally, simulation was performed, where time-series of randomly increasing and decreasing numbers in a range of 0–5 with no particular meaning were generated. 1000 signals each of a duration of 10 h were simulated and ROC for a randomly selected threshold was constructed.Results:The Figure shows ROC curves for SV, HR and MAP predicting a decrease of themselves. All variables have a high AUC in predicting their future values regardless of the threshold chosen. The simulation shows equally high AUC.Conclusions:MAP does not predict hypotension as a condition of local organ hypoperfusion.

When using the current MAP to predict MAp< 65 mmHg, there is a natural relationship that creates a statistical dependency. The ROC analysis simply illustrates the likelihood that a MAP value of 65 mmHg will be preceded by other MAP values (e.g., 67 or 70 mmHg), which is intuitive since to reach a hypotensive event from a higher MAP, the blood pressure must pass through adjacent values. As the Figure shows, all hemodynamic variables and the simulation data ‘predict’ themselves regardless of the chosen threshold due to this statistical coupling in a time series analysis.ReferenceMulder MP et al.

Understanding the varied underlying physiological mechanisms that lead to hypotension may help choose specific therapeutic interventions to causally treat hypotension. We aimed to identify endotypes for hypotension using big data and unsupervised deep learning methods.Methods:We developed an unsupervised deep learning algorithm to identify endotypes of hypotension. The algorithm is a deep learning autoencoder model combined with unsupervised learning. The autoencoder model captures the most important information of the input data to reduce data dimensionality, and the unsupervised learning classifies the information into a number of types in the autoencoder latent space. Stroke volume index, heart rate, systemic vascular resistance index, and stroke volume variation were the inputs to the algorithm. Hypotension was defined as mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg for at least 1 min. The algorithm was developed using 871 surgical patients who had 6848 hypotensive events. We validated the algorithm using an additional 926 surgical patients who had 4842 hypotensive events and 1000 critically ill patients who had 31,615 hypotensive events.Results:Unsupervised deep learning revealed four distinct hypotension endotypes. Based on their physiological and clinical characteristics, these endotypes can be labeled as hypovolemia, vasodilation, bradycardia, and myocardial depression (Figure).

As pre-specified in the protocol, circulating DPP3 levels were measured at baseline and after 72 h within the ACCOST-HH study, and were associated with 30-day mortality and organ support measures.Results:A DPP3 concentration of 40 ng/mL, derived from the 97.5th percentile in the general population, was pre-defined as cut-off. Within the study, median DPP3 concentration at baseline was 43.2 ng/mL [21.2–74]. Elevated DPP3 was associated with a higher 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0–2.9], as well as with all organ support measures tested: (i) days without cardiovascular organ support including VA-ECMO and Impella (21 vs. 3 days,p= 0.0005), (ii) need for renal replacement therapy (22% vs. 56%,p< 0.0001), and (iii) rate of mechanical ventilation (74% vs. 90%,p= 0.04). Longitudinal analyses with determination of DPP3 at baseline and 72 h revealed that low and initially elevated but decreasing DPP3 concentrations were associated with a markedly reduced 30-day mortality, when compared to constantly high DPP3 concentrations (30% vs. 74%) (Figure).Conclusions:Circulating DPP3 is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in cardiogenic shock. The results need to be validated in further cardiogenic shock cohorts, but otherwise hold strong promise for the upcoming clinical trials on the evaluation of the specific DPP3-antibody procizumab as new breakthrough therapy in cardiogenic shock.ReferenceKarakas M et al.

Mitochondrial oxygen tension in the skin (mitoPO2) can be measured by the COMET system (Photonics Healthcare B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands). To enable its use, COMET relies on Alacare plasters (photonamic GmbH, Pinneberg, Germany) to induce protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the skin. The COMET technology uses the optical properties of PpIX to measure oxygen in the mitochondria. Serum lactate is a marker for hypoxia, and abnormally increased serum lactate is associated with adverse patient outcome. Thus, the existence of an association between mitoPO2and lactate would demonstrate usability of mitoPO2as clinical parameter.Methods:In an observational clinical study in 40 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, mitoPO2was monitored peri-operatively, i.e. during surgery and stay on the ICU/PACU. Serum lactate was measured at least every 6 h. The relationship between mitoPO2and lactate values was investigated using mixed model logistic regression.Results:The predicting value of the area under the curve of mitoPO2during 60 min [mitoPO2]60, versus increased lactate (> 2 mmol/L) in 474 pairs of lactate and mitoPO2was analyzed. An odds-ratio of (OR) of 0.97 (p< 0.001) per unit [mitoPO2]60(in mmHg) was found. An analysis of the intraoperative subset of lactate and mitoPO2pairs (n = 220) resulted in and odds-ratio for [mitoPO2]60of 0.93 (p< 0.002). A scatterplot and frequency distribution of the intraoperative subset are presented in the Figure.Conclusions:A prolonged period of low mitoPO2is associated with an increased risk of pathological serum lactate, and thus increased perioperative risk. Therefore, it can be concluded that mitoPO2provides useful information about patient status, and could potentially be used as an early warning sign of patient deterioration or endpoint of resuscitation.Figure (abstract P089)Intraoperative data.

Recent guidelines emphasize the need for new monitoring methods to facilitate targeted CSA-AKI prevention and treatment strategies. In-vivo mitochondrial oxygen tension (mitoPO2), which is semi-continuous and can be measured in real time, could potentially fulfill this role during cardiac surgery.Methods:This prospective observational study examines the association between mitoPO2< 20 mmHg and the risk of CSA-AKI. The study included 75 patients with an increased pre-operative CSA-AKI risk. All patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. MitoPO2was measured intraoperatively and CSA-AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Post-hoc analyses were conducted for four additional mitoPO2thresholds < 25, < 30, < 35, < 40 mmHg.Results:Patients who developed CSA-AKI had significantly more intraoperative time with mitoPO2below 20 mmHg, but this threshold was not associated with CSA-AKI risk (p= 0.06). Conversely, mitoPO2below the other thresholds was associated with CSA-AKI risk, with the < 25 mmHg showing the highest odds ratio (OR). Every minute spent < 25 mmHg increased the risk of CSA-AKI by 0.7% (p= 0.02), visualized in the Figure, while every percentage increase in intraoperative time below this threshold raised the risk by 2.1% (p= 0.02). The percentage of time that mitoPO2was < 25 mmHg remained an independent risk predictor when analyzed in a multivariate regression model (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.04,p= 0.04).Conclusions:This study highlights the association between mitoPO2and the onset of CSA-AKI. Extended durations below the mitoPO2threshold of 25 mmHg strongly correlate with an elevated CSA-AKI risk.

We determined oliguria incidence according to each assessment method and for different thresholds. Performance of each method to predict 90-day mortality and acute kidney disease (AKD, defined by a 20% decrease in eGFR compared with baseline) at hospital discharge was calculated. The association between oliguria and 90-day mortality was explored with logistic regression models and quantified using marginal relative risks (MRR), stratified by admission type and controlling for age, SAPS II, Charlson index and admission year. Missing covariates were multiply imputed.Results:Among the 15,253 patients analyzed, the average method identified oliguria more often than the persistent method (73 [95%CI 72–74] vs. 55 [95% CI 54–55] %) (Figure). It displayed a higher sensitivity for 90-day mortality prediction (85 [95% CI 84–86] vs. 70 [95% CI 69–72] %)and AKD at hospital discharge (87 [95% CI 85–88] vs. 72 [95% CI 70–74] %).

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors for developing AKI and to assess the association between AKI and ICU mortality.Results:Of 476 evaluated patients, 60% (n = 286) had AKI, of which 93.7% fulfilled UO criteria. AKI could be established by sCr in 59.1% of patients, while 40.9% had exclusively UO criteria. Age above 60 years (OR 2.9), obesity (OR 3.1), a higher SAPS II score (OR 1.03), use of mechanical ventilation at day 1 of ICU stay (OR 5.2) and previous chronic renal disease (OR 5.6) were associated with an increased risk for AKI. Overall mortality in this cohort was 24.4% (32.9% in patients with AKI and 11.6% in patients without AKI). KDIGO stages 2 (OR 3.7) and 3 (OR 10.6) were associated with ICU mortality (p< 0.001). Of note, patients diagnosed only by UO criteria did not have an increased ICU mortality. RRT was used in 16% (n = 47) of patients. Among survivors, only 2 patients persistently needed RRT at ICU discharge. Global kidney function recovery was 95.3% (n = 183).Conclusions:In a single-center cohort analysis of 476 critically-ill COVID-19 patients, 60% had AKI. This was driven by the occurrence rate of AKI defined by UO criteria. KDIGO stages 2 and 3 were associated with ICU mortality. Most of the patients with AKI had recovered by the time of ICU discharge. Future studies should explore long term kidney outcomes.ReferenceGabarre P et al.

Data were presented using median and p25–p75.Results:A total of 105 measurements were collected, with 74.3% representing male subjects with a median age of 62 years (41–69), CrCl-24 h at 60 mL/min (42–89), and a PA of 3.4° (3.0–4.2). Non-oncological immunosuppressed, hematooncological, and patients with solid tumors accounted for 51.4%, 34.3%, and 14.3%, respectively. The initial 75 measurements were allocated to the training cohort, showing a significant linear correlation between HAPA and UCE-24 h, as well as HAPA/SCr and CrCl-24 h (r = 0.67 and r = 0.81 respectively). Through stepwise linear regression, a predictive formula for CrCl-24 h was develop using HAPA and SCr. The model underwent validation with the remaining 30 measurements (validation cohort), resulting in an R2of 0.77. The sensitivity to predicting CrCl-24 h below 60 mL/min was higher compared to the CG formula, with 83% and 67% sensitivity, respectively.Conclusions:HAPA, as a weight-independent surrogate for UCE-24 h, affords a more precise CrCl-24 h estimation compared to CG, particularly exhibiting higher sensitivity within renal dosage adjustment ranges for immunocompromised ICU patients.Figure (abstract P093)Left panel: correlation plot between height-adjusted phase angle/serum creatinine (cm*/mg/dL) and measured 24 h creatinine clearance (mL/min) in training cohort.

Blood and urine samples were collected within 12 h after the occurrence of KDIGO 3 AKI. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of RRT initiation criteria within 72 h after the onset of severe AKI. These criteria were rigorously defined based on recent RCTs on RRT timing. The study analyzed a panel of routine biomarkers (pH, serum potassium, and serum creatinine) and novel biomarkers (urinary C–C motif chemokine ligand 14 [CCL14], urinary Kidney Injury Molecule 1 [KIM1], nicotinamide and its metabolites, circulating dipeptidyl peptidase [cDPP3] concentration and plasma proenkephalin A 119–159).Results:Among the 256 patients, 101 (39%) met at least one criterion for RRT initiation or died within 72 h after the inclusion. None of the individual biomarkers or their combinations demonstrated satisfactory predictive performance for the primary endpoint. The best biomarker combination was ‘pH’, ‘serum creatinine concentration’ and ‘urinary CCL-14’ with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (95% CI) of 0.72 (0.65–0.78). In an exploratory analysis, urinary CCL14 showed promise in patients with toxic-induced kidney injury (AUC 0.74 [0.57–0.90]).Conclusions:No biomarker or combination of biomarkers demonstrated conclusive predictive accuracy for the need for RRT in severe AKI patients.P096 User experience (UX) study to evaluate clinical decision support system prototype supporting continuous kidney replacement therapy in a simulated ICU environmentLM Kunz1, M Metzger2, C Schäfer3, R Pohlmeier4, J Petrovic5, MT Nosch61Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Critical Care & Ventures, Bad Homburg, Germany,2Marienhospital Bottrop gGmbH, Information Technology Department, Bottrop, Germany,3Marienhospital Bottrop gGmbH, Nursing for Intensive Care Medicine, Bottrop, Germany,4Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Global Medical Office, Bad Homburg, Germany,5Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Market Access & Health Economics, Bad Homburg, Germany,6Marienhospital Bottrop gGmbH, Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Bottrop, GermanyCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P096Introduction:The increasing amount of data routinely collected on ICUs poses a challenge for clinicians [1] which is aggravated with data-heavy therapies like continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT).

Extended high-volume continuous renal replacement therapy (HV-CRRT) can significantly improve treatment outcomes for patients with septic and nonseptic multiorgan failure by effectively eliminating medium and large toxic molecules [1, 2]. It promotes better hemodynamic tolerability of renal replacement therapy, modulation of the inflammatory and immune response, and has a positive effect on outcomes and mortality.Methods:During 2021–2023, we provided 97 sessions of HV-CRRT in patients with multiple organ failure in our intensive care unit. We used HV-CRRT with a flow rate of 35–50 mL/kg/h. In 13 patients, we used the Prismaflex device, where extracorporeal blood warming occurs by heating the return line (blood returning to the patient). In 21 patients, we used the multiFiltrate device, which uses built-in heating elements to warm dialysate and substitute solutions. We monitored hemodynamics, water-electrolyte and acid–base balance, and axillary body temperature of the patients. To assess the effectiveness of therapy, we assessed the duration of patients’ stay in the ICU, their functional indicators of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and laboratory dynamics of markers of liver, kidney, and hemostasis function.Results:The effectiveness of CRRT was identical in both groups of patients. However, in the group where blood warming was used by heating the return line, the procedure was accompanied by the development of stable mild hypothermia in the range of 34–36 °C, which remained stable despite the use of additional methods of external warming of"

Thus, we aim to evaluate the effect of ADVOS in these patients since established therapies like RRT or extracorporeal life support (ECLS) improve prognosis, but disease progression with metabolic disruption, refractory acidosis and subsequent deterioration of vasoplegia remains challenging.Methods:Patients treated with ADVOS for MOF and refractory shock that received at least 2 consecutive sessions from 11/2021 to 09/2023 were included in this retrospective analysis. The primary objective was the reduction of vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) after 48 h. The course of hemodynamic, hepatic, renal, ventilation and blood gas parameters as well as mortality rates at 28 days and ICU discharge were documented.Results:22 patients (77% male, median age 59,) with a median SOFA Score of 15 received 110 ADVOS sessions (median blood flow and duration of 150 mL/min and 23 h, respectively). At 48 h, a significant increase of blood pH (7.33–7.44,p= 0.001), bicarbonate (22.6–26.8 mmol/L,p< 0.001) and base excess (− 3.2 to 2.4 mmol/L,p> 0.001) was observed. A significant reduction of median noradrenaline doses (0.470–0.180 µg/mL/kg,p= 0.009) and VIS (59–21,p= 0.007) was achieved too (Figure). No device-related adverse events were observed. 28-day and ICU mortality was 55% and 59%, respectively. Considering an expected mortality > 90% [2], this resulted in a SOFA-Score standardized mortality ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.31–1.06), an absolute risk reduction of 29% and a number needed to treat of 3.5.Conclusions:In cardiosurgical patients with end-stage shock, ADVOS was safe and feasible, and significant hemodynamic improvement could be observed.ReferencesFuhrmann V et al.

We analyzed data by Wilcoxon test.Results:CRRT mean duration was 43 in MALA versu 40 h in RF group. Mean blood flow was 127 in MALA and 125 mL/min in RF pts. Dialysate flow was respectively 2285 and 2416 mL/h. Mean pH and BE at admission were in MALA 6.99 and − 24 and in RF 7.18 and − 15 (p= 0.001). During first 6 h, pH increased by 0.13 in MALA and 0.18 in RF but faster in MALA than in RF pts in the next 6 h (p> 0.05). BE increased by 3.9 in MALA and 6.3 in RF in the first 6 h and by 7.4 and 4.5 in the next 6 h (p> 0.05) (Figure). Catot/Ca++ratio was significantly higher in MALA group (p= 0.003), mostly during the first 12 RRT hours. 6 MALA pts needed Ca infusion rate increase. Nobody needed citrate infusion variation or develop citrate accumulation with Catot/Ca++> 2.5 or acidosis worsening. All pts were discharged alive from ICU, 5 pts in MALA and 2 in RF group show renal function recovery.Conclusions:In our series concentrated citrate solution RCA seemed to be safe and effective in MALA treatment. Acidosis improvement was delayed only in the very early treatment stage without reaching statistical significance. At the same time, in MALA pts, Catot/Ca++was higher probably due to a certain degree of citrate metabolism impairment but stayed always below 2.5 [2]. Careful monitoring and strict adherence to citrate and Ca infusion protocols are effective to obtain treatment safety.ReferencesPistolesi V et al.

The main objective of our study was to identify clinical and analytical variables on the day of CRRT withdrawal and two days after it, that could predict the failure of discontinuing the therapy and serve as a tool to clinical decision making.Methods:Prospective observational study in 55 patients with AKI of any cause in a 38-bed polyvalent ICU. The failure of the withdrawal of CRRT was defined as the need to restart therapy within 7 days after withdrawal. We collected clinical, analytical and ultrasound variables of interest on the day of removal (day 0) and 2 days after removal (day + 2) the CRRT. Through a logistic regression model and the use of ROC curves, the model with the best performance was determined.Results:CRRT withdrawal was successful in 30/55 patients.

We aimed to identify the variables that are predictive of successful discontinuation of RRT in patients with severe AKI managed under a conservative approach, and to formulate a clinically applicable scoring system to guide decision-making in this context called the UNDERSCORE.Methods:In thispost-hocanalysis of two large randomized controlled trials (AKIKI and AKIKI2), we included adult ICU patients with stage 3 AKI who underwent RRT (as a standard delayed initiation strategy) and had an attempt to discontinue RRT. The primary outcome was successful discontinuation of RRT, defined as no need for a new RRT session within seven days after the initial discontinuation. A logistic regression model was developed to predict the primary outcome, leading to the formation of the UNDERSCORE tool (Figure).Results:Among 554 patients managed with a conservative RRT approach, weaning attempts were made in 180 patients; of these, successful discontinuation of RRT was achieved in 101 (56%) patients. Factors such as urine output, mechanical ventilation and vasopressive agent the day after the weaning attempt, duration of RRT, and septic shock at admission were identified as significant predictors [SG1]. The UNDERSCORE tool, which incorporates these predictors, showed high predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85.Conclusions:The DOORS study identified evidence-based predictors for successful discontinuation of RRT initiated under a conservative approach. It also introduced the UNDERSCORE as a valuable tool for clinicians. This score can assist in the decision-making process for discontinuing RRT in ICU patients with AKI, potentially reducing complications and healthcare costs.Figure (abstract P102)The UNDERSCORE* for predicting successful weaning of RRT in ICU.P103 How to predict early hypophosphatemia in the ICU?C Lauwers, L Langouche, J Gunst, A Pesonen, MP CasaerKU Leuven, Laboratory of Intensive Care Medicine, Leuven, BelgiumCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P103Introduction:A caloric intake of > 50% of target may"

Preadmission risk factors remain unclear, however, rendering it impossible to anticipate such hypophosphatemia. Therefore, we aimed to describe the incidence of AHP and RHP in the absence of early parenteral nutrition (PN) and identify potential risk factors.Methods:Patients aged over 2 years admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for > 2d in the University Hospitals Leuven between September 2022 and May 2023 with available phosphate levels were retrospectively investigated (n = 412). Hypophosphatemia was defined as an absolute value < 0.65 mmol/L or a relative decrease of > 0.16 mmol/l on the second day in ICU. Baseline characteristics, and the caloric intake on the third day in ICU were recorded. Potential risk factors for developing AHP and RHP were assessed by multivariate logistic regression, separately in the adult and pediatric cohorts.Results:AHP occurred in 17 patients (4.7%) and RHP in 122 patients (33.9%) in the adult cohort (n = 360). In the pediatric cohort (n = 52), AHP developed in only 2 patients (3.9%) and RHP in 22 patients (42.3%). Age, sex, body weight and body-mass index (BMI) were similarly distributed among patients with and without AHP and RHP in both the adult and pediatric cohorts. The subsequent caloric intake on day 3 was > 50% of target in 58 patients (14.1%) in the total cohort, in 3 patients with AHP (15.8%) and 19 patients with RHP (13.2%). Age, sex, body weight and BMI did not independently associate with the occurrence of AHP or RHP.Conclusions:RHP occurred often after ICU admission, whereas AHP was rather uncommon. The potentially detrimental combination of AHP/RHP and a nutritional intake > 50% of target was rare in the absence of early PN. Preadmission characteristics could not predict the occurrence of AHP or RHP. Future studies should further investigate the significance of AHP and RHP in relation to outcome.P104 Prealbumin dynamic assessment for nutrition support effectiveness in critically ill patientsE Pardo1, M Jabaudon2, T Godet2, B Pereira3, D Morand4, E Futier2, E Le Cam5, MP Bonnet6, JM Constantin71Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Département Anesthésie-Réanimation, Paris, France,2CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Department of Perioperative Medicine, Clermont-Ferrand, France,3CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Biostatistics and Data Management Unit, Clermont-Ferrand, France,4CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Direction de la Recherche Clinique, Clermont-Ferrand, France,5Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Département d’Anesthésie-Réanimation, Paris, France,6Hôpital Armand Trousseau, Département Anesthésie-Réanimation, Paris, France,7Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Département d’Anesthésie-Réanimation, Paris, FranceCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P104.Introduction:Prealbumin (PAB) has been suggested to be a sensitive predictor of clinical outcomes and a quality marker of nutrition support.

We assessed the performance of PAB initial value and dynamic changes for predicting short-term outcome and nutrition support effectiveness.Methods:The study included patients admitted to the ICU (2009–2016), with at least one initial PAB value available. Data, prospectively recorded, were extracted from the electronic ICU charts. We estimated the performance of PAB to predict ICU mortality using univariable then multivariable logistic regressions. Association of PAB dynamic changes and nutrition support was assessed using multivariable linear mixed-effects model and multivariable linear regression. Subgroup analysis was performed to identify patients in whom PAB dynamic assessment may be particularly relevant.Results:We included 3136 patients with a total of 4942 available PAB levels. Both initial PAB (aOR 0.04 CI 95% 0.01–0.23) and PAB first week change (aOR 0.02, CI 95% 0.00–0.19) were negatively and significantly associated with ICU mortality. During the whole ICU stay, PAB dynamic changes were associated with both cumulative energy (estimate: 33.2, SE: 0.001,p< 0.01) and protein delivery (1.39, SE 0.001,p< 0.01). During the first week of stay, PAB changes were independently associated with mean energy (6.03e−04, SE 2.32e−04,p< 0.01) and protein intakes (1.97e−02, SE 5.91e−03,p< 0.01). The association of PAB with energy intake was strongest among older, malnourished patients, with increased inflammation and disease severity. Finally, PAB changes was associated with a positive mean nitrogen balance at D7, only in patients with SOFA < 4 (p= 0.047).Conclusions:PAB initial and first week change is an accurate predictor of ICU mortality. PAB dynamic assessment may be a reliable tool to estimate ICU nutrition support effectiveness, especially in at-risk patients.P105 Hypokalemia during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Compared to patients who did not develop hypokalemia, patients who did were younger (46.3 ± 19.3 vs. 52.3 ± 21.5,p= 0.003), had a lower pH (7.08 ± 0.14 vs. 7.15 ± 0.11p< 0.001) and lower bicarbonate (8.99 ± 4.50 vs. 12.3 ± 4.11,p< 0.001) (Table).

Patients hospitalized for 48 h and up to 8 weeks were included. Patients admitted for DKA/HHS, OB/GYN, liver transplant, and suspected brain death were excluded. Separate univariate and then multivariate analyses were performed for each glucose level from 100 to 250 mg/dL in 10 mg/dL increments to test for the association between the time spent above that level and 90-day mortality. Due to interaction, the analysis was stratified by DM status.Results:1397 patients (21.67% with DM) with 72,030 glucose measurements were included in the final analysis. Patients with DM had higher mean glucose (163 ± 28.1 vs. 138 ± 26.5;p< 0.01), higher glucose variability (30 ± 10.6 vs. 22.3 ± 9.7;p< 0.01), and higher 90-day mortality (43.9% vs. 33.2%;p< 0.01).

We examined the impact of acute nutritional therapy on long-term outcomes of Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) and post COVID-19 condition in severely ill COVID-19.Methods:This work was supported by MHLW Research on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases and Immunization (Program Grant Number JPMH21HA2011). Total energy per body weight (kcal/kg/week) and protein intake (g/kg/week) were calculated during the first week after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary outcome was a decrease in quality of life (QOL) defined by EuroQol-5dimensions-5level < 0.8 at 1 year after the date of COVID-19 diagnosis. We made secondary outcomes physical impairment, mental impairment, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and post COVID-19 condition at 1 year after the date of COVID-19 diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis examined the association between energy and protein intake and PICS, MUST and post COVID-19 condition.Results:The 220 patients were included in the study. The median total energy and protein intake per body weight during the first 7 days after admission to the ICU was 65.12 kcal/kg/week and 3.30 g/kg/week. Logistic regression analysis adjusted by age, gender, body mass index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, duration of mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilatory therapy, and extracorporeal circulation showed that total energy and protein intake during the first 7 days after ICU admission reduced QOL decline (energy: odds ratio 0.98 [0.97–0.99],p= 0.008; protein: odds ratio 0.75 [0.59–0.95],p= 0.018). The incidence of malaise and muscle weakness as the post COVID-19 condition and the incidence of middle risk or higher in MUST was lower with higher energy and protein administration.Conclusions:Acute nutritional therapy after admission to the ICU was associated with better QOL after 1 year after COVID-19 infection and may prevent some of the post COVID-19 conditions.P112 The difference of resting energy expenditure by using predictive formulas and indirect calorimetry in Asia burn patientsHC Hu1, LT Chou2, HY Cho2,"

Overfeeding or underfeeding will cause different complication[1]. There is several predictive formulas are developed for patients nutritional supplement[2–4]. The gold standard for assessing energy expenditure (EE) is indirect calorimetry (IC). The aim of this research is to investigate the difference of resting EE (REE) in Asian patients measured by IC and several current used formulas.Methods:This is a prospective study. Adults admitted to burn ICU due to burn injury with greater than 25% of body surface area and respiratory failure were enrolled. All enrolled patients received measurements on day-1, 3, 5 after admitting to ICU. Calorimeter module on the ventilator was used for IC measurement. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was calculated by the Harris–Benedict equation. Predictive equations were used for comparison [5–9].Results:There were statistically significant differences between measured EE and predicted REE and between measured EE and real caloric intake. Bland–Altman analysis showed a mean bias of 550.5 kcal/day. The 95% CI for the lower and upper limits of agreement ranged from − 1731.7 to 709.7 kcal/d and from − 391.3 to 630.8 kcal/d, respectively.Conclusions:Our results suggest that measured REE by IC was significantly higher than calculated REE in Asian burn patients need mechanical ventilation. Indirect calorimetry is advised to modify the patient’s nutrition strategy.ReferencesClark A et al. Burns Trauma. 2017;5:11Ireton-Jones CS et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2002;17:29–31Ireton-Jones CS et al.

The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy of hypocaloric-high protein feeding protocol on mortality and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidences among critically ill obese patients.Methods:The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA) methodology was used to search PubMed, EMBASE and MIDLINE databases. All papers published up to up to July 2021 with mortality and VAP incidence as primary outcomes were retrieved. The secondary outcomes were average daily caloric intake and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.Results:No significant reduction in the mortality incidence when the hypocaloric-high protein feeding approach was used (RR 0.74, CI 0.35–1.56,p= 0.43), similarly, no significant reduction in VAP incidence were observed when the hypocaloric-high protein feeding approach was used (RR 0.84, CI 0.50–1.41,p= 0.52). Additionally, no significant reduction in the mean ICU days when the hypocaloric-high protein feeding approach was used (MD − 0.82 days, CI − 5.90 to 4.27,p= 0.75), but there was a significant reduction in mean daily caloric intake in the hypocaloric-high protein feeding approach groups (MD − 4.80 kcal/kg/day, CI − 6.99 to − 2.62,p< 0.0001).Conclusions:This review did not indicate superiority of hypocaloric high protein feeding approach to eucaloric or standard feeding approach in regards of mortality, VAP incidence and length of ICU stay. There was a significant reduction in daily caloric between hypocaloric high protein feeding compared with eucaloric or standard feeding approach, with no benefits to the outcomes.P114 An automated electronic medical tool to recall nutritional intake and present feeding adequacy in the critically ill: it all starts with an excel fileL Buyle1, L de Hart2, Z Rosseel3, BG Jimenez Garcia4, L Leemans5, E De Waele41UZ Brussel, Department Clinical Nutrition, Jette, Belgium,2UZ Brussel, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel), Department Clinical Nutrition, Jette, Belgium,3UZ Brussel, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel), Department of Pharmacy, Jette, Belgium,4UZ Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel), Department Clinical Nutrition, Research Cluster Development - Ageing and Pathology, Jette, Belgium,5UZ Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Rehabilitation Research (RERE), Jette, BelgiumCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P114Introduction:Feeding adequacy in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains an issue.

ESPEN guidelines still advocate energy prescription based on indirect calorimetry (IC) adapted for the non-nutritional calories [1]. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), which is a type of continuous renal replacement therapy will alter energy and protein targets due to exchange of nutrients [2,3]. We aimed to evaluate how the E/P needs changes due to CVVH and how this could impact the choice of available parenteral medical nutrition.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed on adult ICU patients admitted between 01/01 and 31/12/2022 treated with CVVH who had at least one IC measurement. We calculated the energy target based on REE (resting energy expenditure) measured with IC from which the bioenergetic balance of the CVVH was deducted. The E/P of each subject was calculated.Results:A total of 45 IC measurements were included. When citrate was used, E/P ratio was 10.28 ± 2.44 kcal/g compared to 15.95 ± 3.15 kcal/g when citrate was not used which was statistically significant different (p< 0.01).

Given multiple aetiologies and presentations, the diagnosis is commonly delayed, impacting negatively the outcome. There has been a paradigm shift in management from an aggressive surgical strategy to minimal invasive endoscopic therapies, including stenting. We present 7 case reports as a reminder to assist physicians in a prompt diagnosing and managing of this deadly disease.Methods:We reviewed 7 esophageal perforation clinical cases that were admitted in our intensive care unit (ICU) during 2023. We reviewed the patient’s clinical files, blood tests, radiology results and surgical protocols.Results:The cases occurred amongst 7 male adults: 2 iatrogenic (age 19), 2 cases after food impaction (age 31–65, 1 Mallory-Weiss Syndrome) and the remaining with Boerhaave Syndrome (BS) (age 45–77). Clinical presentation included pneumomediastinum (85.7%), pneumothorax (28.6%), mediastinitis (28.6%), pneumoperitoneum (14.3%) and cervical abscess (14.3%). Time to diagnosis was on average 2.41 days (6 h–8 days), and admission in the ICU with an average APACHE 17% and SAPS II 24%. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 57% and vasopressor support in 43%. Endoscopic stenting was the treatment strategy in 3 patients (1 needing subsequent surgery), 1 needed emergency surgery and the remaining 3 resolved spontaneously. Surgical control of mediastinitis was paramount in 2 cases. Five patients initiated parenteral nutrition, with an average of 7 days of therapy, enteral nutrition initiated on average 5.3 days after diagnosis. There was no associated mortality, although 3 patients remain hospitalized with clinical stability.Conclusions:These reports emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, namely in BS.

Early diagnosis and treatment are the mainstay to decrease morbidity and mortality. The gold standard for non-invasive intra-abdominal pressure monitoring is intravesical pressure measurement, which has several limitations. For this reason, this study is conducted to develop a new non-invasive method to diagnose IAH, especially for unreliable or unable to measure intravesical pressure.Methods:This cross-sectional diagnostic study was conducted in the surgical intensive care unit. The gold standard intravesical pressure measurement was measured, and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) was recorded. Simultaneously, a new non-invasive method by physical examination combined with ultrasound was assessed in all patients. The ratio of maximal anteroposterior to transverse abdominal diameter (AP-T) was also obtained. The relationship between IAP and the ratio of maximal AP-T was evaluated by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The ability of a new non-invasive method to detect high IAP was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis with the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and by computing sensitivity and specificity.Results:Of the 67 patients, 18 patients were diagnosed with IAH defined by IAP ≥ 12 mmH2O, and 49 patients had normal abdominal pressure. The relationship between the ratio of maximal AP-T was correlated with IAP (R20.704,p< 0.001). The ratio of maximal AP-T diameter exhibited good discrimination for abdominal hypertension with AUROC 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.94. A ratio of maximal AP-T diameter ≥ 0.56 could detect high IAP with a sensitivity of 83.33%, a specificity of 83.67%, a positive predictive value of 65.2%, and a negative predictive value of 93.2%.Conclusions:In this study, a new non-invasive method may be considered an alternative to intravesical pressure measurement for detecting IAH.P119 Demographic variables as predictors of clinical outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplantationG Madrid1, AF Zuluaga1, A Montoya2, A Obando1, A Delgadillo1, A Pinilla1, F Raffan1, JF Parada-Márquez11Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, Anesthesiology, Bogotá, Colombia,2Universidad de Los Andes, Faculty of Medicine Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, ColombiaCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P119Introduction:We conducted a study to determine sociodemographic factors associated with postoperative ICU requirement in liver transplant patients.

In this case, a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) device was preferred to achieve satisfactory oxygenation. For some clinicians, in order to achieve sufficient oxygenation when HFNC is not available, supplemental oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula (NC) (max 6 L/min) could be added to a non-rebreathing mask (NRM) at 15 L/min [1]. However, the FiO2values delivered by this improvised system (IS) are not known. The aim of this study was to compare, on a bench, the FiO2value delivered by these devices.Methods:In a bench study, we analysed the FiO2delivered by (a) NRM alone (15 L/min) (b) a combination of NRM (15 L/min) and a nasal cannula (6 L/min) c) HFNC (FiO2100% and flow 60 L/min).

Data acquisition was carried out using Labscribe 3™ software (Iworx®, United States). The parameters were modified as follows: Minute Ventilation (MV) for 10, 15 and 20 L/min and Ti/Ttot of 0.33 and 0.25. The experiment was repeated three times. A one-way repeated measures of variance or Friedman test was performed to analyse the differences between results.Results:See the Figure.Conclusions:MV has a negative impact on FiO2. NRM at 15 L/min O2does not achieve 100% FiO2. The combination of NRM (15 L/min O2) and NC (6 L/min O2) allows an increase in FiO2, but the impact in absolute values is limited (+ 8.7%). HFNC offers the highest FiO2value but it does not reach 100% and is influenced by MV. Some results are consistent with previous studies [2, 3].ReferencesKumar A et al.

These included two of the following: unbearable dyspnea, respiratory rate > 35 breaths per minute, PaO2/FiO2< 100 mmHg or SpO2< 90% with FiO2≥ 70%. Helmet was applied continuously for at least 24 h with PEEp= 12 cmH2O and pressure support = 12 cmH2O. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.Results:77 patients were included (55 males (65%), median [IQR] age 82 [81–84] years, PaO2/FiO2during high-flow oxygen 89 [69–113], respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute [25–35]). The overall duration of treatment was 48 h [29–79]. Survival rate to hospital discharge was 38% [95% CI 27–49%]. With HNIV, PaO2/FiO2after 24 h improved irrespectively of the subsequent outcome (90 vs. 144 mmHg in patients who survived, 89 vs. 140 mmHg in patients who died,p= 0.19) [Figure]. At the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival to hospital discharge were lower SAPSII (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.47, − 0.93]) and lower respiratory rate before treatment start (OR 0.69 [95% CI 0.48, − 0.97]).Conclusions:In elderly patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure refractory to high-flow oxygen and DNI order, HNIV applied continuously for at least 24–48 h and with standardized settings was associated to 38%-possibility of being discharged alive from the hospital.

We categorized patients as either NIV success (defined as discharged alive from ICU) or NIV failure (defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation or death). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Heart Rate, Acidosis, Consciousness, Oxygenation, and Respiratory Rate (HACOR) score and ratio of oxygen saturations (ROX) index at various timepoints are reported.Results:We included 106 patients (median age 63 years, 56% male). Median PaO2/FiO2ratio and SOFA score on ICU admission were 155 mmHg and 5 respectively. Overall, our NIV success rate was 59% and in patients with NIV success, 28-day mortality was lower than for patients who failed NIV (13 vs 35%,p= 0.0085). In univariate analysis, NIV failure was associated with SOFA score (OR 1.33), HACOR score (OR 1.14) and presence of septic shock (OR 3.99). SOFA score has an AUC of 0.75 for NIV failure on ICU admission, whilst HACOR has an AUC of 0.76 after 2 h of NIV. A threshold of HACOR ≤ 5 after 2 h of NIV predicts success with sensitivity and specificity of 53% and 85%, whereas SOFA ≤ 4 has a sensitivity and specificity of 61% and 72%. There were no differences in pH, PaO2/FiO2ratio, PaCO2or ROX index between NIV success or failure at any timepoint.Conclusions:Our results suggest that SOFA ≤ 4 and HACOR ≤ 5 are reasonable thresholds to identify patients with severe CAP likely to benefit from NIV.P126 Impact of ultrasound settings on B-lines: an exploratory study in mechanically ventilated patientsJ Leote1, A Gonçalves2, J Fonseca2, D Guerreiro2, H Dias2, I Ribeiro2, R Meireles2, R Varudo1, J Bacariza1, F Gonzalez11Hospital Garcia de Orta, EPE, Almada, Critical Care, Almada, Portugal,2Escola Superior de Tecnologia da Saúde de Lisboa, Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa, Lisboa, PortugalCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P126Introduction:The number of B-lines in lung ultrasound (LUS) impacts patients clinical management.

In this study, we aimed: (i) to develop a mathematical algorithm to extract ITOTas a post-hoc LUS analysis, and (ii) to confirm ITOTutility by conducting laboratory VA research using an in vitro model with different acoustic channels.Methods:The ITOTwas extracted from static and conventional LUS imaging recorded from in vitro models after varying the amount of water content or the pores size of the phantom, in comparison with a control condition.Results:The developed algorithm was able to calculate the ITOTfrom all phantoms. Mean ITOTshowed statistically significantly different values across phantom categories.Conclusions:We demonstrate that ITOTmay be able to differentiate the in vitro acoustic channels formed by increased water content from those with small size pores.

Sidestream-dark field (SDF) videomicroscopy has been used in animal models to assess pulmonary microcirculation in vivo. This study aimed to evaluate whether different mechanical ventilation settings could affect the alveolar size and pulmonary vessels in a porcine model.Methods:This experimental study was conducted in four healthy pigs on mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia. The ventilation was initially set at a tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and FiO250%. Access to the thoracic cavity was obtained through surgical thoracotomy. The subpleural pulmonary microcirculation was assessed using SDF videomicroscopy at different ventilator settings: VT 8 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO250%; VT 12 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO250%; VT 8 mL/kg, PEEP 12 cmH2O, FiO250%; VT 8 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2100%. We calculated the diameter of the alveoli and extra-alveolar microvessels.Results:Comparing VT 8 mL/kg and VT 12 mL/kg, we observed a significant increase in alveolar diameter (89 [70.6–114.7] μm vs. 94.6 [78.3–115] μm,p= 0.04) and a significant decrease in vessels diameter (10.4 [8.6–12.7] μm vs. 9.2 [7.6–11.2] μm,p< 0.01). We did not observe a significant difference in alveolar and vessels diameters after changing the PEEP from 5 to 12 cmH2O. Increasing the FiO2from 50 to 100%, the alveolar diameter significantly raised (86.7 [69.6–112.6] μm vs. 94 [72.7–122.5] μm,p= 0.03) as well as the vessels diameter (10.4 [8.5–12.5] μm vs. 12.2 [10.3–14.7] μm,p< 0.01).

These waveforms serve as training data for machine-learning algorithms to improve detection and classification of patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA), an adverse event during mechanical ventilation [1, 2].Methods:GANs refine simulations of patient-ventilator interactions incorporating ventilator-specific and patient-specific factors while employing adversarial learning and self-regularization to preserve the labeling of the simulations. We evaluated the use of the generated data for training PVA detection and classification methods, comparing it to the original simulated data [3].Results:The use of generated data translated into enhanced PVA detection and classification. Notably, the detection method trained on generated data showed improved accuracy in locating the patients' respiration which resulted in an increased classification performance when validated with an independent clinical dataset from a different hospital (Table). Although the detection method trained on generated data excelled across various PVAs, detecting “ineffective effort” presented challenges due to inherent noise in real clinical data.Conclusions:This study underscores the potential of GANs in improving PVA detection and classification, contributing to improved quality of mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the proposed approach could be translated to other areas where labeled data are scarce.ReferencesBakkes T et al. Comput Methods Programs Biomed 2023;230:107333Sassoon CS et al.

Social determinants of health are known contributors to health outcomes, however the impact of SDoC on clinical care has yet to be investigated. Utilizing the MIMIC-IV database, we analyzed a cohort of 8919 patients to identify disparities in care related to social factors.Methods:The study included all patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), excluding cases with missing weight data or weights outside the 10–250 kg range. Frequency of turning documentations per day were evaluated and compared using Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and predictive models such as ridge regression, to assess adherence to turning protocols during IMV. These methods were cross-validated and included varying degrees of artificially injected noise for robustness.Results:The patient cohort mean age was 63.5 years, with 58% males, white ethnicity (61.2%), and 88.8% reported English as their first language. There was a significant difference between the observed and simulated turning frequencies (p< 0.05), indicating poor adherence to local protocols, as confirmed by Fisher's method over the two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Furthermore, regression on the quantile space, reflecting the relationship between patient weight and turning frequency, yielded a low R2score (ranging from 0.0185 to − 0.0166), suggesting high variance across quantiles. A positive correlation between weight and turning frequency was significant across all noise thresholds and Fisher’s aggregation (p< 0.05) (Figure).Conclusions:Our findings indicate significant disparities in the adherence to IMV care protocols in ICUs, influenced by patients weight. The variance in care frequencies, irrespective of clinical features, highlights the need for tracking such features to encourage more equitable ICU care practices.Figure (abstract P130)Correlation between the quantiles of weight and the quantiles of the observed average turning interval.P131 Mechanical ventilation strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass.

The ratio of ΔCVP to airway pressure change during the occlusion test was measured and assumed to be constant even during normal ventilation. The magnitude of spontaneous respiratory effort during assisted ventilation was also estimated. The Bland–Altman analysis compared the estimated pleural pressure value (eΔPpl) calculated from ΔCVP with the esophageal pressure measurement value (ΔPes).Results:The mean and standard deviation of ΔPes and eΔPpl were − 9.7 ± 6.6 and − 9.5 ± 6.5 cmH2O, respectively. Bland–Altman analysis showed that the bias was − 0.3, and the precision was 2.6 cmH2O (Figure).Conclusions:Our method can assess spontaneous respiratory effort with reasonable accuracy in adult-sized pigs with respiratory failure without requiring an esophageal pressure catheter across various respiratory mechanics.Figure (abstract P134)The Bland–Altman analysis for the agreement between ΔPes and cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl, classified by each condition.P135 Comparison of occlusion pressures and P0.1in neuro and non-neuro patients considered for a spontaneous breathing trial: a single center prospective pilot studyS Slagmulder1, W Baas1, LMA Heunks2, M van der Jagt1, AH Jonkman11Erasmus MC, Intensive Care, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2Radboud UMC, Intensive Care, Nijmegen, NetherlandsCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P135Introduction:Monitoring inspiratory effort and lung stress during assisted ventilation has become an important aspect of lung- and diaphragm protective ventilation. Two noninvasive parameters are important for estimating lung stress and inspiratory effort: decrease in airway pressure during the first 100 ms of inspiration (P0.1) and the full-breath occlusion pressure (Pocc). Their value in ventilated patients with acute brain injury, is unclear, considering that brain injury can lead to high respiratory drive. We hypothesize that P0.1and Pocc would be higher in patients with acute brain injury, compared to non-neurological ventilated patients appearing ready for extubation.Methods:This prospective pilot study included mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU for acute brain injury (neuro group) or primary respiratory failure (non-neuro group), estimated to be ready for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and possible extubation within 24 h."

There are no data about using fully closed-loop “intellectual” modes in these patients. We assume that automatic management modes of mandatory and assisted ventilation allow to increase patient’s safety and decrease medical staff workload.Methods:In this randomized prospective trial 80 adult cardiosurgical patients with BMI > 30 kg/m2were included. 40 of them in the postoperative period were ventilated with INTELLiVENT-ASV® mode, 40—with conventional ventilation modes provided by 8 physicians. Hamilton G5 ventilators were used. Care in both groups was standardized, except management of mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint of this study was to compare safety of respiratory support by considering driving pressure (∆P), tidal volume (Vt), mechanical power (MP), PEEP and FiO2level.Results:Patients in the INTELLiVENT-ASV® group were ventilated with more protective parameters compared to conventional mode through significant reduction in the ∆P, Vt, MP, FiO2and PEEP levels.

Thus, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should increase PVR if overdistension predominates and not in case of alveolar recruitment. However, this has never been proven in patients. We aimed to study the effect of PEEP on PVR according to lung recruitability, evaluated by the recruitment-to-inflation ratio.Methods:In ARDS patients, we measured hemodynamic (with pulmonary artery catheter), echocardiographic and ventilatory variables (including esophageal pressure), at high PEEP, and after lowering PEEP by 10 cmH2O.Results:Among 54 cases measured in 20 patients, 23 cases had low recruitment potential (LRP) (recruitment-to-inflation ratio < 0.5) and 31 high recruitment potential (HRP). Lowering PEEP from 14 ± 2 to 4 ± 2 cmH2O reduced PVR in LRP cases (from 233 ± 98 to 177 ± 79 dynes·s/cm5,p< 0.0001), while PVR was unchanged in HRP cases (from 223 ± 68 to 220 ± 65 dynes·s/cm5,p= 0.66) (Figure). Right-to-left end-diastolic ventricular areas ratio simultaneously decreased in LRP cases (from 0.67 ± 0.14 to 0.56 ± 0.12,p< 0.0001), while remaining stable in HRP cases (from 0.71 ± 0.17 to 0.73 ± 0.19,p= 0.32).

Although for years in clinical practice, the capabilities of the technology for monitoring the structural changes in the lung tissue are not fully revealed. That is why we aimed to develop a method for personalized reconstruction of EIT static images.Methods:Based on patient’s thoracic CT scan analysis, the slice, presenting the largest intersection with the region of interest, is selected. The level of the slice defines the level of interest at which the electrodes are positioned according to patient’s anatomical Reference points. The margins of the patient’s thorax are determined by applying a fem mesh onto the CT image. Subsequently the raw data from the EIT is processed within the individualized contour of the thorax, reflecting the body structure of the patient [2].Results:The method provides reliable EIT images with significant conformity to the CT images taken at the corresponding level (Figure). This personalized approach surmounts the limitations for placing the EIT electrodes [3] at different than initially recommended positions and reveals indications for potential clinical application of EIT in conditions characterized by heterogeneously disseminated or solitary lesions.Conclusions:The personalized approach in reconstruction of EIT images reveals potential for optimization of monitoring of mechanical ventilation and the monitoring of lung injury dynamics at the bedside.ReferencesRauseo M et al.

We hypothesized that 1) effects of non-normalized MP on 28-day mortality are modified by patient sex, affecting females more markedly due to smaller lung sizes [1], and 2) differences are mitigated by normalization of MP to respiratory system compliance (Crs) as proxy for functional lung size [2].Methods:19,806 (37.9% female) mechanically ventilated patients from the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, USA were included. Median respiratory settings were calculated for the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation and analyses adjusted for a comprehensive confounder model.Results:Median (IQR) non-normalized MP was higher in males than females (11.8 [9.4–15.9] versus 10.4 J/min [8.1–13.7],p< 0.001).

At a threshold of 17 J/min [3], mortality risk was an absolute 8.4% higher for females (Figure). Normalization of MP to Crs(MP/Crs) mitigated differential effects (p-for-interaction = 0.23; Figure). In females, normalized MP was 11.1% higher than males and partially (23.8%) mediated increased mortality risk.Conclusions:Changes in non-normalized MP result in a larger effect size in females than males and risks at non-normalized thresholds show relevant differences between both sexes. Normalization of MP to Crsmitigates differences. Higher normalized MP delivered to females mediated increased mortality risk, supporting the use of ventilation strategies individualized to patients’ Crsas a proxy of functional lung size.ReferencesBrower RG et al.

Dynamic respiratory compliance (CDYN) estimation is typically performed only during controlled ventilation. During assisted ventilation, invasive methods are necessary to have adequate estimates. However, respiratory oscillometry (RO) superimposes a specific designed, low-amplitude waveform on top of the ventilation and measures the resulting flow, which is used to derive the compliance [1]. This study explores the feasibility of using RO for non-invasive respiratory compliance estimation during assisted ventilation. The results are an interim analysis of the first study patient of the McInvent trial.Methods:Intubated, stable patients are included for this explorative feasibility test. Low-frequency RO is applied three times in a row, using a novel setup [1], and compared with the results of the standard of careCDYNestimator [2], using a two-arm crossover design. The measurements are performed twice a day when the patient is on volume control ventilation (VC) and can be continued when ventilation is switched to pressure support (PS).Results:The two measurement sessions were performed on PS (n = 6) and on VC (n = 6). The mean compliance estimated by RO (CRO) during VC was 42.6 mL.hPa−1(95% CI 38.7–46.4) and statistically equivalent toCDYN. During PS, the meanCROandCDYNwere 32.6 mL.hPa−1(95% CI 28.6–36.6) and 810.7 mL.hPa−1(95% CI -1751.2–3372.5), respectively (Figure).Conclusions:Low-frequency RO was feasible and well-tolerated by the patient during PS. TheCROduring PS was closer to the compliance measured during VC than the comparator,CDYNduring PS, which produced unreliable results as expected. However, a difference inCRObetween the two ventilation modes can be observed, disease evolution is a plausible reason. To validate and generalize the results, more patient data is required.ReferencesKeymolen A et al. MeMeA IEEE 2023;1–6Bates JH.

This equation is oversimplified, does not incorporate turbulent airflow, lung heterogeneity, or viscoelasticity, and omits hysteresis. Hysteresis was recently associated with lung injury risk [1]. We study an extended equation of motion that incorporates flow-dependent resistances and viscoelasticity of the respiratory system, which is related to hysteresis.Methods:The parameters of the extended equation are estimated automatically using sequential quadratic programming. The technique is evaluated in an in-silico one-lung and two-lung model, and data from 10 post-operative patients undergoing volume-controlled ventilation is retrospectively analyzed.Results:The original parameters of the one-lung model could very accurately be reproduced (close to 0% error). The error in the two-lung model was larger; 1–3%. The error of the estimates of the viscoelasticity increased when the heterogeneity in the two-lung model increased due to Pendelluft. The estimates of the post-operative patients are in a feasible range and viscoelastic parameters corresponded to parameters found with manual inspiratory occlusion maneuvers [2]. The estimated nonlinear (turbulent) term of the resistance was relatively high (14–40 cmH2Os2/L2) because the resistances of the endotracheal tube, capnography sensor, and bacterial filter were included.Conclusions:The extended equation of motion technique allows for automatic assessment of the viscoelasticity for arbitrary flow profiles and estimation of a nonlinear resistance term. The estimates of the viscoelasticity can subsequently be used to assess and reduce hysteresis in a mandatory ventilated patient, potentially improving patient outcomes by optimizing the therapeutic intervention strategy.ReferencesMarini JJ et al.

Its complexity, derived from various risk factors, poses challenges in personalized diagnosis and treatment, due to its clinical heterogeneity. The current re-evaluation of ARDS criteria [2] intensifies the heterogeneity of the disease, emphasizing the need to identify subphenotypes for personalized treatment and correct patient selection.Methods:We conducted a cross-sectional study at Clínica Alemana de Santiago ICU, approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Machine learning categorized ARDS subphenotypes. We used Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for initial unsupervised clustering, followed by supervised models for root cause analysis, patient classification, and performance measurement.Results:Our models identified two ARDS subphenotypes with significant clinical differences and outcomes. Subphenotype 1 was characterized by lower mortality, less clinical severity, and a less restrictive pattern with improved gas exchange compared to Subphenotype 2, which exhibited the opposite (Table).

HRV was assessed offline from 1-h electrographic tracings using time and frequency measures and compared between C-ARDS and NC-ARDS.Results:During the study period, 24 C-ARDS and 19 NC-ARDS were included. Median heart rate was significantly lower in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS (60 [53–72] versus 101 [91–112] bpm,p< 0.001). HRV was significantly impaired in both C-ARDS and NC-ARDS patients (Table). Almost all time and frequency parameters of HRV were significantly less impaired in C-ARDS patients than in NC-ARDS patients. HRV correlated with heart rate only in C-ARDS patients. No significant differences in HRV parameters were found when comparing survivors and non-survivors. A positive correlation was found between low to high frequency ratio (LF/HF) and ICU length of stay (r = 0.576,p< 0.001). Other HRV variables were not correlated with clinical outcomes.Conclusions:This prospective study confirms that C-ARDS is associated with marked bradycardia and severe ANS impairment. HRV was less severely impaired and correlated with heart rate only in COVID-19 patients, suggesting a sympathovagal imbalance with vagal overtone. Our study did not find a robust predictive value of HRV analysis, but poor outcomes seemed more related to sympathetic than parasympathetic hyperactivation.Table (abstract P147)Heart rate variablility parametersHeart Rate VariabilityAll ARDS (n = 43)C-ARDS (n = 24)NC-ARDS (n = 19)pvalueHeart rate (bpm)77 [57–100]60 [53–72]101 [91–112]< 0.001RR interval (ms)778 [600–1046]1004 [836–1142]595 [538–661]< 0.001SDRR (ms)15 [9–36]25 [14–46]10 [7–18]0.002VLF (ms)60 [17–164]108 [67–257]19 [3.9–42]< 0.001LF (ms)10 [3.0–29]15 [10–69]3.0 [0.71–9.0]< 0.001HF (ms)22 [7.7–64]31 [18–128]9.1 [4.0–27]< 0.001LF/HF ratio0.36 [0.13-0.71]0.45 [0.32-0.87]0.18 [0.09-0.44]0.018Data are presented as medians and interquartile range.

We investigated the effect of ALS on the duration of ECMO management and prognosis of disease.Methods:In this single-centre, retrospective, observational study, patients in ICU who were affected by COVID-19-ARDS that was managed with ECMO, were screened for eligibility from April 2020 to December 2021. Selected patients were categorized into ALS and non-ALS groups. The ALS group was further divided into the post-ALS ECMO group (A–E group) and pre-ALS ECMO group (E–A group). The ICU survival rate, duration of ECMO management, and functional prognosis after 6 months were evaluated.Results:Forty-one patients were included during the study period (ALS group, 19 patients; non-ALS group, 22 patients). The duration of ECMO management (days) was significantly longer in the ALS group [44 (29–64) vs. 9 (7–14),p< 0.05] than that in the non-ALS group. The ICU survival rate was 47% in the ALS group and 86% in the non-ALS group (p< 0.05). With respect to the functional prognosis of ICU survivors, 78% of the survivors in the ALS group and 88% of the survivors in the non-ALS group were ambulatory (p= 0.60). Furthermore, there were five patients in the A–E group and fourteen patients in the E–A group in the ALS group. The duration of ECMO management was similar [22 (9–43) vs. 22 (8–42),p= 0.89], but ICU survival rate tended to be higher in the A–E group [80% vs. 36%,p= 0.14]. In terms of the"

This study aims to develop and validate an interpretable ML-based support system for managing patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with ECMO.Methods:In an ECMO referral center, following approval from the ethical committee, protocol-driven, prospective collected data was represented as multivariate time series (MTSs). Each time instant of the patient-specific MTSs was labeled by a blinded ECMO expert intensivist with a ternary value: -1, 0 or + 1, representing, respectively, clinical deterioration, stabilization or improvement. The resulting datasets subsequently underwent additional processing and transformations for modeling. Different ML models were employed, including support vector machine (SVM) with varying kernels, and random forest (RF). Training and validation feature sets were generated through random assignment of patient-specific sequences, each one comprised of 3 consecutive samples, using a split ratio of 4:1. Each sequence was assigned the label corresponding to the third sample, having been exclusively considered, during training, sequences with a label of − 1 and + 1.Results:82 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with ECMO generated thousands of labeled sequences. After model training and validation, performance was rigorously assessed (Table), resulting in the selection of a high-performing, well-calibrated and interpretable RF model. A clinical prediction score based on the RF model demonstrated a high ability to anticipate major clinical inflections, suggesting potential for clinical use (AUROC: 0.9226 for 4 h; 0.8940 for 8 h; 0.8535 for 12 h anticipation).Conclusions:Our study illustrates the potential impact of ML systems when applied to complex and sensitive medical contexts, such as intensive care medicine, promising transformative advancements in intensive care practices.Table (abstract P156)ML modelsMetrics\\ModelSVM (Linear)SVM (Polynomial)SVM (Radial basis"

We hence performed a meta-analysis on this topic, integrating the latest evidence [1, 2].Methods:Systematic literature search was conducted from inception until September 2023 on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library using the terms “ECMO”, “obesity”, and their related terms. Our primary outcome was to assess the impact of obesity on in-hospital or 30-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were to evaluate the impact of obesity on major vascular complications (bleeding or ischemia), ECMO duration and hospital length-of-stay. A random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) was adopted for meta-analysis. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.Results:This meta-analysis included 24 studies from 2013 to 2023, including a total of 49,102 ECMO patients (mean age 51.14 ± 11.57 years). Obese patients, when compared with non-obese patients, had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality (risk difference − 4%, 95% CI − 7 to 0%, I2= 68%,p= 0.03) (Figure). Regarding secondary outcomes, obesity had no significant association with major vascular complications (risk difference 1%, 95% CI − 2 to 4%, I2= 29%,p= 0.38). Obesity was associated with significantly shorter hospital length-of-stay (mean difference − 2.39 days, 95% CI − 4.62 to − 0.15, I2= 77%,p= 0.04), but had no impact on ECMO duration (mean difference 0.34 days, 95%CI -0.06 – 0.74, I2 = 44%,p= 0.10).Conclusions:In summary, our meta-analysis showed that obesity is not a negative prognostic factor in ECMO. ECMO, as a life-saving treatment option in critically ill patients, should not be withheld from obese patients who are otherwise suitable candidates.ReferencesRudym D et al.

Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to respiratory infections are often treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The impact of the ECMO circulation on the motility of immune cells has just been explored in a few studies and needs further investigation.Methods:This was a prospective, single-centre study. Only patients who were successfully weaned from ECMO were included in the study. Blood samples were taken daily up to 30 days. A new prototype of microscope (ComplexEye) was used to image motility (percentage of moving cells and average speed of moving cells) of NG in a 96-well plate. Different NG-stimuli were used during the study (CXCL1, CXCL8 and fMLP). Subsequent analysis was done by artificial intelligence software.Results:28 patients were included. 9 patients could successfully weaned from ECMO and included in the final analysis. ResultsduringECMO therapy: The average percentage of moving cells was 70.73% in unstimulated NG (PBS), 87.15% (fMLP), 77.86% (CXCL1) and 84.05% (CXCL8) in stimulated NG (Figure upper panel). The average speed of moving cells in unstimulated NG was 5.61 µm/min and 12.15 µm/min (fMLP), 6.6 µm/min (CXCL1), 9.08 µm/min (CXCL8) in stimulated NG (Figure lower panel). ResultsafterECMO therapy: The average percentage of moving cells was 66.11% in unstimulated NG (PBS), 87.22% (fMLP), 69.29% (CXCL1), 84.94% (CXCL8) in stimulated NG (Figure upper panel). The average speed of moving cells in unstimulated NG was 5.3 µm/min and 11.7 µm/min (fMLP), 5.98 µm/min (CXCL1), 8.91 µm/min (CXCL8) in stimulated NG (Figure lower panel).Conclusions:There was no significant difference in the percentage of moving cells or average speed of neutrophil granulocytes during ECMO therapy compared to no-ECMO therapy in 9 critically ill patients. This data shows that ECMO therapy does not alter chemotaxis in neutrophil granulocytes in critically ill patients with ARDS.Figure (abstract P158)Upper panel. shows percentage of moving cells with different stimuli during and after ECMO therapy of 9 patients.

In a cohort of VV ECMO patients, we compared those with ≤ 7 days (early connection, EC) to those with > 7 days of pre-ECMO MV (delayed connection, DC). The primary objective is to determine if the duration of pre-ECMO MV independently affects long-term mortality (LTM). Additionally, to compare characteristics and course of patients with EC and DC to ECMO.Methods:Single center retrospective cohort study. We included all patients on VV ECMO at our institution between 02/01/2017 and 08/31/2023. Demographic, physiological variables and severity scores were assessed pre ECMO. In-hospital course was recorded. Survival was followed till 09/30/2023. Variables are presented as median [IQR]. Univariate analysis comparing patients with EC and DC and a multivariate Cox regression analysis for LTM were performed. Significance was set atp< 0.05.Results:52 patients were included, 33 had COVID-19, 10 died in-hospital; 33 had EC and 19 DC. Hospital mortality was 24.2% and 10.5%, respectively (p= 0.293). Those who died had higher APACHE II (17.5 [10–23.3] vs. 10 [1–14] points,p< 0.01) and lower RESP score (0.5 [− 3 to 2.3] vs. 2 [0–4] points,p= 0.03). Follow up was 820 [248–1126] days; 2 more patients died after hospital discharge. In a model including pre-ECMO MV duration, APACHE II and RESP score, the hazard ratio for LTM of pre-ECMO MV duration was 0.944 [95% CI 0.846–1.05], (p= 0.307) for each additional day. The Table compares patients with EC and DC. Patients with DC had longer ECMO runs (21 [16–55] vs. 10 [5.5–24] days,p< 0.01) and ICU stay (56 [47–118] vs. 31 [13–57] days,p< 0.01) than those with EC. Patients with DC also developed more coagulopathy (68% vs. 36%,p= 0.026) and required more tracheostomies (84% vs. 39%,p< 0.01).Conclusions:Pre-ECMO MV duration had no effect on LTM in VV ECMO patients.

Considering that the rapidity of acidemia recovery is an independent risk factor for mortality [2], the aim of this work is to analyze the exact timing for pH correction and the main factors leading to it in patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) and hypercapnic acidosis treated with ADVOS.Methods:Patients treated with ADVOS for MOF and hypercapnic acidosis in the tertiary care ICU of the University Hospital of Technical University of Munich (Germany) from 01/2021 to 02/2022 that survived at least 24 h were included in this retrospective analysis. The primary outcome was the time to reach a blood pH ≥ 7.35. During the ADVOS treatments pre- and post-dialyzer blood samples were taken to analyze the course of blood gases and the CO2removal rates. The course of hemodynamic, hepatic, renal and ventilation parameters were documented.Results:Each of the 24 patients (75% male, 61 years, SOFA 15) received a median of 5 sessions (total 134) with median blood flows of 300 mL/min, concentrate flows of 320 mL/min and dialysate pH of 8.5 under citrate anticoagulation alone (4%) or combined with UFH (96%). The median time to reach pH ≥ 7.35 was 4 h showing a significant pH increase at 24 h (7.21–7.39,p< 0.01). A total of 461 pairs of pre and post-dialyzer samples showed a median CO2removal of 53 mL/min which reduced PCO2(64–55,p< 0.241). The main determinants for CO2removal were a dialysate with a lower bicarbonate content and a higher pH in combination with a higher blood flow (Figure).Conclusions:A single session of ADVOS corrected blood pH within 4 h and supported the reduction of PCO2through a median CO2removal of 53 mL/min in patients with multiple organ failure and hypercapnic acidosis.ReferencesAllescher A et al.

We applied parametric and non-parametric tests; statistical significance set atp< 0.05. Data expressed in median and interquartile range or percentage.Results:Of 42 included patients, 17 were followed by TT. Patient’s characteristics (Table) were similar between groups, except for sex and neurological disorders.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated by heat-killedCandica albicansand concentrations of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma and interferon gamma induced protein (IP)-10 were measured in supernatants by an enzyme immunoassay.Results:Concentrations of TNF-alpha were greater in the supernatants of PBMCs of patients with severe COVIND-19 than bacterial pneumonia (Figure). The potential of PBMCs presented variability for cytokine production depending on the time of the infection. More precisely, the production of IFN-gamma and IP-10 differed between the two time periods; IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha did not have such trend (Figure).Conclusions:This study shows that severe COVID-19 of the years 2022–2023 is characterized by hypersecretion of TNF-alpha by PBMCs being pro-inflammatory over bacterial CAP.

Sepsis is characterized by major endothelial dysfunction, microvascular alterations, and coagulopathy. In addition to their involvement in pathological hemostatic processes, platelets are key players in sepsis as they promote immunothrombosis. The composition of the platelet lipidome is critical to their function. However, the lipidomic profile of platelets during sepsis has never been studied.Methods:Platelets were isolated from 48 septic and 48 control patients.

Platelets from patients with septic shock showed increased levels of diacyl and triacylglycerols, as well as ceramides and deoxyceramides. A concordant decrease in sphingomyelin species was also observed. Excessive ceramide formation has been associated with multiple disorders, including atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Regarding phospholipids, patients showed a reduction in lysophospholipids as well as alterations in the composition of fatty acid chains. An increase in short and (un)saturated fatty acid chains was observed and associated with a substantial reduction in phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines containing long polyunsaturated fatty acid chains (ω3 and ω6). The latter are key phospholipids for the generation of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators.Conclusions:Critical changes in the platelet lipidome occur during sepsis. Upregulated lipids are mainly glycerolipids and ceramides, while lysophospholipids are drastically reduced. These changes as well as alterations in the composition of the fatty acyl chains of phospholipids might play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease.Figure (abstract P167)Box-plots of identified lipid classes/subclasses, comparing septic shock patients and controls: the Y-axis displays the Log2FC of the signal intensity values of each lipid species in septic vs control groups.

If the sepsis definition and criteria capture the wrong patients there is a risk of dilutional effect on research and a risk to miss diagnosing patients or delay treatment. By utilizing high-throughput proteomics and explainable machine learning, we look to further interrogate the unique molecular definition of sepsis to improve diagnosis and personalize patient care.Methods:Patients were eligible for inclusion if ≥ 18 years and admitted to the emergency department at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden with suspected sepsis. Plasma samples were withdrawn at admission and analyzed using data-independent acquisition trapped ion-mobility mass spectrometry to generate comprehensive proteome maps. Through statistical analysis, explainable machine learning, and novel feature selection methods we investigated the unique proteome signatures associated with different clinical parameters to provide a molecular definition of sepsis.Results:In 1380 patients, we identified panels of proteins that were predictive for septic shock. We combined each protein panel into a consensus molecular signature to train a machine learning model that predicts septic shock with high accuracy.

For fluid unresponsiveness, lactate is the gold standard biomarker for vasopressor treatment despite its inadequate predictive value. Heparin binding protein (HBP) is a protein mainly stored in granules of neutrophils with increased plasma levels in sepsis and septic shock. Due to its mediation of increased capillary permeability, it causes outflow of plasma. This raises the question whether HBP can play a role in the development of fluid unresponsiveness in sepsis and be of additive value to lactate in predicting vasopressor treatment in sepsis alert patients.

We aimed to assess the presence of clinical phenotypes and their concordance with immunological phenotypes in patients screened for participation in the PROVIDE study (NCT03332225).Methods:PROVIDE was a personalized immunotherapy trial; 240 patients were screened for immunological phenotypes; those with MALS were further randomized to placebo-controlled anakinra [2]. Clinical phenotypes were determined using a 6-variable algorithm (based on creatinine, lactate, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, International Normalized Ratio) [3]. Differential impact of clinical phenotypes on outcome was assessed in patients non-receiving immunotherapy. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Concordance was defined by Cramer’s V ≥ 0.3 (indicating at least moderate association).Results:Clinical phenotype determination was possible in 238 patients. Distribution and overlap with immunological phenotypes is shown in the Figure panel A (α: 34.4%, β: 20.6%, γ: 22.3%, δ: 22.7%). The association between clinical and immunological phenotypes was weak (Cramer’s V = 0.190). Among patients non-receiving immunotherapy (n = 223), clinical phenotyping was predictive of mortality only in the intermediate immunophenotype (n = 91; Log rank 16.91;p= 0.001); phenotyping could not be predictive of outcome in MALS (n = 33; Log rank 0.57;p= 0.902) and immunoparalysis (n = 99; Log rank 1.260;p= 0.739) (Figure panel B).Conclusions:Clinical phenotypes allow better characterisation of intermediate immunophenotype, but offer no additional information to MALS and immunoparalysis.ReferencesSeymour CW et al.

We strived to develop and comparatively validate a BSI prediction tool in this frail population.Methods:We collected full clinical information on all adult patients hospitalized in our tertiary transplant center following an HSCT from 2010 to 2022. The plethora of data was incorporated into a multivariate prediction model following a three tiered selection process: (1) significantly predicting of BSI on multivariate analysis; (2) hazard proportionality maintained (using scaled Schoenfeld residuals); and (3) no collinearity (r < 0.7) with any other predictors.Results:BSI occurred in 489 (46%) of 1067 patients included. Reduction in total magnesium and inorganic phosphor as well as increase in total bilirubin were independently predictive of BSI (Figure). Combined with total white blood-cells, platelets and eosinophil count, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and heart-rate increase, we achieved an pseudo-R2= 0.784. Our receiver-operating characteristic area-under-curve was 0.840 (95%CI [0.753–0.927]) versus the previously published artificial intelligence derived BSI prediction models (none of which were validated to HSCT patients specifically) of 0.752 (95%CI [0.700–0.790]) [2] and 0.810 (95%CI [0.800–0.845]) [3, 4].Conclusions:The unique physiology and profound immunosuppression of patients undergoing HSCT may benefit from specially designed BSI predictor models.ReferencesMisch EA et al.

However, at S1 the test was run on a remnant once the alert fired, whereas at S2, the test was included if ED providers used the sepsis order-set. All blood samples were collected and tested per standard of care within 5 h. The test generates an Index, stratified into 3 interpretation bands (Bands 1–3) of increasing sepsis likelihood [2]. Sepsis status was determined through blinded retrospective physician adjudication.Results:At S1, 189 patients (sepsis prevalence: 12.2%), were stratified as 131 (69.3%) in Band 1, 44 (23.3%) in Band 2, and 14 (7.4%) in Band 3.

Differing site sepsis prevalence and operations yielded differences across the Bands. At both sites, the test achieved comparable negative predictive values for Band 1(97.7% and 97.4%) and positive predictive values for Band 3 (71.4% and 59.5%). While the percentage of patients within each Band that received SEP-1 care elements increased across Bands, a similar number of patients received the care metric independent of the Band (Fig panel B).Conclusions:Our findings suggest that this host response test may improve risk stratification and resource utilization despite different ED sepsis protocols.ReferencesPaoli CJ et al.

Patients were divided in development and validation cohorts, and the proteins were grouped in sets of up to three and subjected a machine learning algorithm. Initially, a specific combination of proteins was analysed within the development group using elastic net logistic regression. Subsequently, the results were tested against the validation cohort to evaluate the predictive power of these protein combinations.Results:Bioinformatics models revealed a robust correlation between classic pro-inflammatory cytokines and other proteins associated with immune cell proliferation and activation. Combinations of two or three proteins demonstrated the highest predictive capability for in-hospital mortality, while single proteins displayed considerably lower predictive power (Figure).Conclusions:It is suggested that these proteins serve as prognostic tools for guiding clinical decision-making and treatment strategies for critically ill COVID-19 patients.

For each patient receiving antibiotic therapy, we collected data regarding blood count, duration of therapy and infectious agent involved (multi drug resistant (MDR) vs. non-MDR), then we calculated the NLR at the time of the first antibiotic prescription. Lastly, we compared NLR values between different subgroups of patients: MDR infected and non-MDR infected (t-test), septic shock and other diagnoses (Mann–Whitney-U test), survivors and non-survivors (Mann–Whitney-U test).Results:The study population was composed by 140 males and 68 females, the median age was 64 years[49; 77].

However, the impact of the Omicron variant in lung transplantation patients is unclear. This study focuses on lung transplant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the Omicron wave, and investigate the clinical presentations, outcomes and pulmonary function.Methods:In this single-center retrospective study, we enrolled lung transplantation patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 2022 to December 2022. Demographic, laboratory and pulmonary function data were recorded. Pre-COVID-19 pulmonary function data were obtained from the closest routine test, and post-COVID-19 tests were arranged after release from quarantine.Results:Of the 22 enrolled patients, four were admitted to general wards for treatment and observation, and two needed oxygen support. All of the patients recovered from COVID-19. There were no significant decreases in forced vital capacity (FVC) (2.3 ± 0.6 vs. 2.2 ± 0.8 L,p= 0.363) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (2.0 ± 0.6 vs. 1.9 ± 0.8 L,p= 0.269) after COVID-19 infection. Daily prednisolone dose and serum tacrolimus levels were significantly correlated to the duration of positive COVID-19 test and change in FEV1. Patients who were not fully vaccinated or did not receive a booster dose had a significantly longer positive test duration (9.1 ± 4.1 vs. 26.6 ± 24.4 days,p= 0.05), and greater decrease in FEV1 (23.6 ± 137.3 vs. − 331.8 ± 537.8 L,p= 0.040).Conclusions:In this study, lung transplant patients infected with COVID-19 during the Omicron wave did not have severe disease and the mortality rate was low.

Spearman's Correlation Analysis was used to examine the relationship between continuous variables.Results:Mortality ratio among polytrauma patients was 17.8% (n:14). There was statistically significant difference in terms of GCS, SOFA, APACHE-II and the level of procalcitonin at 6.th day between survivors and non-survivors. The first 7-day levels of CRP were similar between survivors and nonsurvivors. Respiratory tract culture and blood culture positivity had a correlation with mortality. The SOFA scores of the nonsurvivors recorded at the day of the diagnosis of the infection were significantly higher.Conclusions:As a result of this study, it was concluded while CRP levels are high due to trauma and do not predict mortality, procalcitonin levels can be used to predict the presence of infections and relationship between infections and mortality. In order to develop appropriate prescriptions regarding empirical antibiotic selections, the study result that blood culture and respiratory tract culture positivity is associated with mortality should be taken into consideration.ReferencesVan Breugel JM et al.

Sepsis and septic shock are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and pose great pressure on the ICU and the entire health system. Studies have shown a close relationship between infection, hospital length of stay, and mortality.Methods:Retrospective cohort study including all patients admitted to a multipurpose ICU between 2015 and 2019. Demographic and clinical data were collected as microbiological isolates, along with their antibiotic resistance profile. A two-step cluster analysis was performed to identify patterns.Results:We evaluate 2085 admissions of which 820 have a microbiological isolate. As much as 55 different bacteria were found. Male gender was predominant (61.9%). The mean age and mean SAPSII Score were 67.4 ± 13.6 years and 50.4 ± 18.9 respectively. The median ICU length of stay was 4.2 days (IQR 5.83). ICU and In-hospital mortality were 20.8% and 34.3%, respectively. It was possible to segregate the sample into 3 different clusters. The major predictors for each cluster were resistance to common antibiotics: Cluster 1 (Amoxicillinresistant); Cluster 2 (multi-sensible) and Cluster 3 (Quinolone and Penicillin resistance). Both ICU LOS and time of mechanical ventilation were statistically significative higher in Cluster 3. Clusters 1 and 2 were similar in our model. This classification was not helpful to identify different patterns of risk for ICU and Hospital mortality (Table).Conclusions:Cluster analysis techniques are a new and powerful method to analyze and discriminate different groups within large samples. In this exploratory analysis, we developed a model with good internal coherence. This was able to point to differences in patients' profiles according to isolated bacteria"

Identifying the etiological microorganisms (MOs) during VAP and their relationship with the lung microbiome is crucial for optimizing antibiotic treatment to improve antimicrobial usage.Methods:This prospective cohort study was conducted at Clinica Universidad de La Sabana in Colombia from January 2020 to July 2022. In the intensive care unit (ICU), ventilated patients were enrolled within 12 h of hospital admission. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected using a standardized protocol. Specimens were obtained at ICU admission and 72 h after admission. MOs were classified by species through Conventional Culture (CC) and by Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Statistical analysis was performed using R studio.Results:A total of 80 patients were included; 51% (41/80) developed VAP. Culture/sequencing results and characterization are shown in the Figure.

We aimed to identify predictive factors for ICU patients with CRKP-induced bacteremia and pneumonia to enhance treatment and prognosis.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study involving data from ICU-treated patients with CRKP-induced bacteremia and pneumonia at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou branch from January 2017 to December 2021. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, as well as treatment and outcome information were collected. Predictive factors were analyzed using statistical methods to determine their association with outcomes.Results:A total of 161 patients were included in the study. Thirty-day mortality was reported for 105 patients (65%). Most CRKP clinical isolates were carbapenemase producers (132/161; 81.9%), of whichK. pneumoniaecarbapenemase (KPC)-producing isolates were most prevalent (112/132; 84.8%).

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with mortality in ICU patients with BSI caused by KPC-Kp.Methods:All data from patients who suffered from BSI caused by KPC-Kp in ICU from January 2017 to December 2021 were retrospective analyzed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. All patients simultaneously suffered with respiratory failure and were all received mechanical ventilation. We analyzed outcome of BSI with KPC-Kp in ICU patients.Results:A total of 168 patients were identified during the study period. The 30 days mortality rate was 61.9%. Higher Pitt bacteremia score, SOFA score and Charlson morbidity score were found in our patients. The most frequent infection source of BSI was pneumonia (112, 66.7%). The result of multivariate analysis showed ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) based regimen (hazard ratio (HR) 0.312, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.151–0.648;p< 0.002) and appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48 h after KPC-Kp BSI onset (HR 0.623; 95% CI 0.408–0.950;p< 0.028) were independently associated with favorable outcomes (Figure).Conclusions:We found that appropriate antibiotic treated within 48 h after KPC-Kp blood stream infection onset and CAZ-AVI treated were crucial factor in favorable outcome among patients with respiratory failure in ICU. We recommend the utilize of novel rapid molecular test in high risk of hospital acquired KPC-Kp infections patients [1].

Nowadays, the number of carbapenem-resistant strains is increasing. Colonization and infections caused by these strains can become a problem of our time.Methods:IfAcinetobacterspp. is detected in these materials in GUH, susceptibility to selected antibiotics (co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, imipenem and meropenem) is routinely tested by disc diffusion method. If the strain is resistant to carbapenems, carbapenemase production is determined using rapid immunochromatographic test (CARBA-5) and MIC of colistin is determined.Results:Between 12/2022 and 5/2023, (VIM-type carbapenemase-producing)Acinetobacterspp. was detected in 34 unique BAL or aspirate samples. The strains were identified by MALDI-TOF (mass spectrometry) asAcinetobacter junii.All these strains were susceptible only to gentamicin and colistin. CARBA-5 test detected VIM-type carbapenemase in these strains. These results were confirmed in the National Reference laboratory (NRL) for antibiotics. The NRL also proved the isolates to be identical by genotyping. Epidemiological investigation found out that bronchoscopy of all patients colonized with this strain was performed in the same operation theatre. 144 samples were taken from the environment of the bronchoscopy operating theatre and staff. The source of the carbapenemase-producingAcinetobacter juniiwas found in the heating bath for saline solution used in bronchoscopy procedure. Corrective actions were implemented andAcinetobacterspp. strain with this resistance phenotype has not been detected since.Conclusions:Environmental sampling is essential during outbreaks, but it is also recommended to be done periodically as a prevention of outbreaks.

Association between immunosuppression and MDR colonization or infection has shown conflicting results in ICU. Our purpose was to assess outcomes in critically ill patients CPE colonized according to immune status.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients admitted to an ICU from 2019 to 2022 in a university hospital with a screening of CPE on admission ± 48 h. CPE infection on admission and ICU stay < 48 h were exclusion criteria. CPE colonization was the primary exposure. Hospital mortality was the primary endpoint. Associations were studied with logistic regression.Results:Among 965 patients included, 631 (65%) were males and median age was 61 (49–69) years. Overall, 504 (52%) were admitted for non-surgical reasons, with a median SAPSII of 42 (28–55). Immunosuppression (IS) was present in 512 (53%) patients, the main cause being solid organ transplantation (386 (40%) patients). On ICU admission, 58 (6%) patients were CPE colonized and 35 (4%) developed a CPE infection. Overall, 261 (27%) patients died during hospital stay. CPE colonized patients were more likely admitted to ICU for urgent surgery (22% vs. 10%;p= 0.004), less likely immunosuppressed for any given reason (34% vs. 54%;p= 0.005), had higher SAPSII (51 vs. 41;p= 0.004), were more likely CPE infected (17% vs. 3%;p< 0.001), and more likely to die during hospital stay (48% vs. 26%;p< 0.001) than non-colonized ones (Table). Following adjustment for ICU admission type, IS status and SAPSII, CPE colonization was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR (95% CI) 2.00 (1.07–3.73);p= 0.031), contrary to CPE infection (aOR (95% CI) 1.62 (0.41–6.75);p= 0.49).Conclusions:In a large cohort of critically ill patients, CPE colonization was associated with worse short-term mortality, irrespective of IS status.ReferenceGomides MDA et al.

Linezolid-resistant strains of staphylococci and vancomycin and/or linezolid resistant enterococci are more frequently detected. Enterococci resistant to all commonly available antibiotics are no exception. These highly resistant strains mainly threaten immunocompromised, haemato-oncology patients, but can also cause hospital-acquired infections in patients without known immunosuppression.Methods:We have selected 20 unique isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) resistant to linezolid and 25 unique isolates ofE. faeciumresistant to vancomycin and/or linezolid obtained from clinical samples of patients hospitalized in General University Hospital in Prague in 2022–2023. Minimum inhibitory concentration values of vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin were in this study determined by gradient strip method.Results:Interpretation criteria (breakpoints by EUCAST 2023) are provided for all tested antibiotics except for daptomycin inE. faecium.In CoNS group, no resistance to vancomycin or daptomycin was detected, resistance to teicoplanin was 20%. InE. faeciumgroup, 56% of strains were resistant to linezolid and the same percentage resistant to vancomycin, 40% resistant to teicoplanin. All isolates ofE. faeciumwere susceptible to daptomycin (using ECOFF according to EUCAST—8 mg/L).Conclusions:Daptomycin could be an appropriate treatment option for infections caused by vancomycin and/or linezolid-resistant strains of Gram-positive cocci. It would be appropriate for official breakpoint to be defined.

In particular, it is said that the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders has sharply increased. Following the spread of COVID-19 in Japan, there has been an increase in neck infections requiring intensive care unit management at our hospital, prompting an investigation into the actual situation.Methods:From the medical records of our hospital, we retrospectively extracted patients with severe neck infections admitted to the emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) from January 2013 to October 2023, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined age, gender ratio, underlying diseases, presence of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, number of surgical drainages, and the number of tracheostomies.Results:During the period, 85 individuals received treatment in the EICU. The fluctuation in the annual number of admitted patients and the prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan is depicted in the Figure. The average age was 57 years (range: 22–90), with 52 males and 33 females.

The use of systemic steroids showed improvement in mortality, especially in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) [1]. There are some reports on the use of pulse methylprednisolone (MPS) in COVID-19 with controversial results [2–4]. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patients who received MPS pulses compared with dexamethasone.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing COVID-19 patients ≥ 18 years with ARF who received MPS compared with dexamethasone from July 2020 to September 2021. The effectiveness outcomes [endotracheal intubation (ETI), ICU- mortality (ICU), in-hospital mortality] and safety outcomes (insulin requirements and infections) were evaluated. An inverse probability weighting-propensity score (IPW-PS) approach was used to control for potential treatment-assigned bias. A robust approach analysis was used to adjust other potential confounders.Results:328 patients were included, 100 in the dexamethasone group and 228 in the MPS group. The characteristics were balanced after the IPW-PS (standardized difference of the mean < 0.15) (Figure panel A). Patients in the MPS group compared with the patients in the dexamethasone group had higher ETI rates (30% vs. 10%,p= 0.001), higher ICU mortality (32% vs. 14%,p= 0.001), higher in-hospital mortality (35% vs. 15%,p< 0.001), higher insulin requirement (p= 0.01); and higher number of infections (p< 0.001) (Figure panel B).Conclusions:The use of MPS is associated with increased ETI rates, mortality, higher insulin requirement, and higher incidence of infections.ReferencesThe RECOVERY Collaborative Group et al.

These rates might have been further aggravated by the impact of COVID-19, with secondary nosocomial infections being reported in higher rates, with higher antibiotic consumption, potentially leading to increased risk of MDR. We aimed to describe the prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP), caused by MDR bacteria, and to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes.Methods:Single center retrospective cohort study performed at two ICU of a university hospital. All adult mechanically ventilated (MV) patients, admitted between 2018 and 2022, were included if they presented a positive lower respiratory tract sample, due to clinical suspicion of VAP. Patients were divided according to the occurrence of VAP by MDR pathogen, and according to their occurrence before or after the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic (2020).Results:126 patients were included, and 37 of the observed VAPs were caused by MDR. No differences were found between MDR and non-MDR VAP patients in demographic and clinical characteristics or in ventilatory, vasopressor or renal supports. Furthermore, these patients did not differ in ICU length-of-stay or 28-day mortality rates. On the other hand, patients with VAP after 2020 (n = 72; 36 had COVID-19 pneumonia at admission) had significantly lower rates of isolation of MDR bacteria, and higher rates of invasive multiorgan support. Moreover, at sampling dates, VAP patients after COVID-19 pandemic presented lower PaO2/FiO2and higher C-reactive protein serum levels. These patients also had higher ICU length-of-stay but lower mortality rate (p= 0.004 and log-rank testp= 0.03, Figure).Conclusions:Critically ill patients undergoing invasive MV during and after COVID19 pandemic appear to present lower rates of MDR pathogens causing VAP and lower mortality rates despite higher need of organ support requirements and ICU length-of-stay.Figure (abstract P204)Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of mechanically ventilated patients with VAP diagnosis before and after COVID-19 pandemic.P205 How often do we need to adjust the dose of linezolid in critically ill patients"

This study aimed to assess the importance of TDM of LZD in patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary hospital.Methods:Retrospective study of patients admitted to a multipurpose ICU between 2022/11 and 2023/07, who received treatment with LZD and performed TDM. To determine LZD exposure, minimum concentrations (Cmin) and maximum concentrations (Cmax) were measured after a minimum of 3 treatment administrations. The primary endpoint were the achievement of a Cmin of LZD between 2 and 8 mg/L and AUC > 100 µg/mL/h. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TDM-guided dose adjustments.Results:A total of 56 patients were included (Table). Most patients upon admission had medical pathologies (53.4%). The median duration of LZD treatment in the ICU was 8 days [4.0–10.5]. The therapeutic range was achieved at the first measurement in 16/56 patients (28.6%) with a median Cmin2.6 [1.5–6.9] mg/L, median AUC 137.5 [88.0–250.8] µg/mL/h.

The development of gas-producing liver abscess is often accompanied by intravascular hemolysis, leading to a rapid and frequently fatal course within a short period.Methods:From April 2010 to April 2023, patients admitted to our hospital were studied retrospectively for cases of gas-producing liver abscess withC. perfringensdetected in blood cultures. Data including age, underlying conditions, presence of intravascular hemolysis, treatment, mortality rate, and time from admission to death were extracted from our medical chart.Results:The results are presented in the Table. There were a total of 9 cases of gas-producing liver abscess caused byC. perfringens, with a median age of 77 years (range: 74–82). Malignant tumors were observed in 66.7% (6/9 cases), and diabetes was noted in 44.4% (4/9 cases). During examination at the emergency department, intravascular hemolysis was observed in 88.9% (8/9 cases), and 66.7% (6/9 cases) underwent drainage in addition to antibiotic treatment. A total of 55.6% (5/9 cases) resulted in mortality, with a median time from admission to death of 24 h (range: 19–94). Several cases without underlying conditions such as malignant tumors or diabetes have been observed to have long-term survival.Conclusions:Gas-producing liver abscess caused byC. perfringenstends to occur in immunocompromised patients such as those with malignant tumors or diabetes. This condition is characterized by the rapid development of intravascular hemolysis, leading to a swift progression to death. In cases of gas-producing liver abscess with concurrent intravascular hemolysis, early initiation of drainage and antibiotic treatment with consideration forC. perfringensis desirable. However, even with prompt treatment, survival is often challenging in many cases.Table (abstract P206)ResultsVariableAll n = 9Age median (IQR)77 (74–82)Malignancy n%66.7% (6/9)Diabetes n%44.4% (4/9)Intravascular hemolysis n%88.9% (8/9)Drainage n%66.7% (6/9)Death n%55.6% (5/9)Hospitalization-death time median (IQR)24 (19–94)P207 High dose nebulized colistin improves mortality in bacteremic ventilator-associated pneumonia fromAcinetobacter baumanniiN Kazakos1, N Lagos1, T Maniatopoulou1, E Toli1, A Papathanasiou1, G Papathanakos1, C Kittas2, D Koulenti3, V Koulouras4, I Andrianopoulos11University Hospital of Ioannina, Intensive Care Unit, Ioannina, Greece,2University Hospital of Ioannina, Microbiology Department, Ioannina, Greece,3The University of Queensland, UQ Centre for Clinical Research / Faculty of Medicine, Brisbane,"

In order to improve the outcome of such infections nebulized colistin (NC) was introduced with promising but conflicting results on mortality in earlier studies. Currently, NC is used at a much higher daily dose from that used previously. Nevertheless, there is little evidence on the effect of high dose NC in the outcome of AB VAPs, especially in the current era where the percentage of colistin resistant AB strains is rising.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study comparing bacteremic AB VAP that were treated with NC with those that were not.Results:Overall, 59 patients (21 treated and 38 not treated with NC) were included. The 28-day mortality and 7-day mortality were significantly lower in the patient group treated with NC (52.4% vs. 78,9%,p= 0.034) and (9.5% vs. 47.4%,p= 0.003) respectively. Patients treated with NC had a higher percentage of sepsis resolution by day 7 (38.1% vs. 13.5%,p= 0.023) and were more likely to be off vasopressors by day 7 (28.6% vs. 8.1%,p= 0.039).

This study aims to determine which cause of immunosuppression is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in immunosuppressed adults diagnosed with CAP admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).Methods:An observational prospective cohort study was performed based on the MIMIC-IV database. Adult patients with CAP and immunosuppression admitted to the ICU during the first 24 h between 2008 and 2019 were included. The total cohort was subcategorized according to immunosuppression cause (i.e., solid tumor, hematological tumor, autoimmunity status, transplant status, asplenia, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], sickle cell disease, and inflammatory bowel disease). A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to evaluate the relationship between immunocompromise and in-hospital mortality.Results:A total of 1776 patients were included; 58.89% were male with a median age (IQR) of 68 (56–79). Solid tumor was the most frequent cause of immunosuppression (55.68% [989/1776]), followed by hematologic tumor (17,3% [307/1779]). A quarter of the cohort (25.11% [446/1776]) had an etiological microbial isolation. Typical bacterial pathogens related to CAP were the most frequently isolated (57.39% [256/446]). A total of 71,6% (1274/1779) of patients died during the hospital admission. Older age and solid tumors were associated with a two-fold increase in mortality risk among CAP patients with immunosuppression (Table).Conclusions:This study exposes that among immunosuppressed patients with CAP, solid tumor is strongly associated with in-hospital mortality, and each immunosuppression cause represents a different mortality risk for this population. Immunosuppressed patients with CAP might have different clinical outcomes according to the etiology of their immunosuppression and should be addressed individually.Table (abstract P211)Univariate and multivariate analysis of immunosuppression cause and in-hospital mortality in immunosuppressed patients with CAP admitted to ICUVariablesUnivariate analysis OR (95% CI)pvalueMultivariate analysis OR (95% CI)pvalueAge1.03 (1.99–3.03)< 0.011.02 (1.01–1.03)< 0.01Solid tumor2.46 (1.99–3.03)< 0.011.88 (1.48–2.38)< 0.01Asplenia0.23 (0.12–0.59)0.010.38 (0.16–0.88)0.03HIV/AIDS0.53 (0.35–0.82)0.010.88 (0.56–1.39)0.59Inflammatory bowel disease0.47 (0.30–0.74)0.010.60 (0.38–0.95)0.03Autoimmune status0.51 (0.36–0.73)< 0.010.67"

It is investigated if this score can also identify patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) at risk for unfavorable outcome.Methods:ACCESS is a prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial (EudraCT 2020-004452-15; ClinicalTrials.govNCT04724044) investigating early clinical anti-inflammatory responses of clarithromycin treatment in CAP. The prognostic performance of SCORE2 was analyzed in the 133 patients allocated to the comparator arm receiving treatment with standard of care antibiotics and placebo. SCORE2 was calculated using three binary variables from the medical history (chronic renal disease, stroke, smoking) and the cutoffs from 5 continuous variables (urea, SOFA score, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), age, hemoglobin). Survival analysis for 28-day mortality was done.Results:Ninety-eight patients had SCORE2 < 3 and 35 patients SCORE2 3 or more. 3.8% and 20.6% respectively progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and need for mechanical ventilation the first 8 days. 28-day mortality was 7.7% and 30.8% respectively (Figure).Conclusions:SCORE2 is an easy applicable score for the early detection of patients with CAP at risk for progression into ARDS and death.Figure (abstract P212)28-day mortality by the degree of SCORE2.P213 Validation of a new data-driven SLOSR ICU efficiency measure in community-acquired pneumonia patients: a multicenter study of 45,866 admissions in 85 Brazilian unitsA Quintairos1, G Fonte2, GF Ferrari2, L Santos Lourenço Bastos2, S Hamacher2, F Augusto Bozza2, I Tona Peres2, JI Figueira Salluh31D’Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Department of Critical Care and Postgraduate Program in Translational Medicine, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Department of Critical and Intensive Care Medicine, Academic Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota, Bogota, Colombia,2Department of Industrial Engineering, Pontificial Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,3D’Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P213Introduction:Improving patient outcomes with optimal resource use is a major challenge.The Standardized Resource Use"

    "full_text": "a major challenge.The Standardized Resource Use (SRU) is an indicator widely applied to analyze ICU efficiency [1]. However, it is well-known that when evaluating some specific conditions, traditional scoring systems tend to do worse [2]. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with many aspects of treatment to be better understood [3]. Recently, a multicenter study has developed and validated a data-driven methodology to evaluate ICU efficiency using machine learning (ML) techniques with better calibration and more accuracy [2,4]. The SLOSR (Standardized Length of Stay Ratio) provides a more reliable and potentially actionable indicator to assess ICU performance [5]. This work aims to validate the SLOSR in a subgroup of CAP patients.Methods:We included 45,866 CAP admissions, from January 2019 to December 2023, in 85 general ICUs of a Brazilian hospital network. We proposed the SLOSR to evaluate ICU efficiency in this subgroup of patients, which uses the prediction model proposed by Peres et al. [4]. To demonstrate SLOSR models, we used R2, calibration plots, and funnel plots.Results:The calibration showed a high concordance between observed and expected ICU LoS estimates per ICU for SLOSR (R2= 0.89) (Figure). In the funnel plot, the median SLOSR was 1.00 (0.8–1.23) (Figure). Seven ICUs were outside the higher 99% control limit. SLOSR presented a high concordance to obtain a standardized metric for ICU efficiency in a specific subgroup population of CAP.Conclusions:The SLOSR is a new metric that can be used to evaluate ICU efficiency in subgroup of CAP patients with high calibration and accuracy.ReferencesRothen HU et al.

Previously, we described the development of a sampling system for effectively capturing biomolecules from human breath, and identified a new class of proteoform markers of protease activation, termed proteolytic products of infection (PPI), for potentially detecting LRTIs [1].Methods:Here, we further present an in vitro assay by designing a specific substrate-sensor to human neutrophil elastase (HNE), which is highly up-regulated in LRTIs. The sensor is an HNE substrate that is cleaved by the enzyme with higher sensitivity and specificity, yielding higher resolution. We then applied this in vitro assay to breath samples collected from both intubated patients and healthy volunteers (Figure panels A–B).Results:The findings revealed that the LRTI group demonstrated a significant mean differential, showing a 9.8-fold elevation in measured HNE as compared to the non-LRTI group, and a 9.2-fold compared to healthy volunteers (Figure panels C–D). The in vitro assay's diagnostic potential for LRTIs was assessed by constructing an ROC curve, resulting in an AUC value of 0.987 (Figure panel E). Using an optimal threshold for HNE at 0.2 pM, the sensitivity was determined to be 1.0 and the specificity to be 0.867. Further correlation analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between the measured HNE-activity and the protein concentration in the breath samples.Conclusions:Our results demonstrate that this breath-based, in-vitro assay provides high diagnostic performance for LRTIs, suggesting that the technology may be useful in the near term for the accurate diagnosis of LRTIs in critical care.ReferenceChen D et al.

Omission of patients with cDPP3 > 70 ng/mL at baseline was prespecified in the statistical analysis plan for the assessment of 28-day mortality.Methods:All-cause mortality for 28-day follow-up was evaluated and Kaplan–Meier plots were generated comparing enbarcimab (combined doses) vs. placebo as specified in the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan.Results:301 patients were enrolled in the full analysis population, 35 (23.5%) and 42 (27.6%) patients died in the enibarcimab and placebo group, respectively (HR 0.84,p= 0.439). In the prespecified subgroup of cDPP3 ≤ 70 ng/mL (n = 269 patients), 28-day mortality tended to decrease to 18.0% (n = 23) in the enibarcimab group, whereas mortality rate in the placebo group remained 26.2% (n = 37) resulting in a HR of 0.65 (p= 0.106) (Figure).

The aim of this study is to investigate if modulation of NET release could be another relevant immunomodulatory mode of action for trimodulin.Methods:Neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors and NET release was induced by PMA or immune complexes (heat aggregated IgA or IgG). Trimodulin, IVIg or buffer were added and NET release was measured by cytox green fluorescence intensity. Furthermore end-point measurements of NET markers were performed.Results:The addition of trimodulin to PMA- or immune complex stimulated neutrophils leads to a strong dose-dependent reduction of NET release (up to 57% reduction in amount of external DNA compared to untreated control), while standard IVIg has only little effect. Mechanistically trimodulin and standard IVIg seem to condense the NETs, but there are no distinct effects on the measured NET markers.Conclusions:The results of this in vitro study demonstrate that modulation of NET release may be a viable mode of action for trimodulin, which may be relevant in the treatment of severe lung infectious diseases. The superior immunomodulatory effects of trimodulin on neutrophils could be mediated by the additional IgM and IgA antibodies within trimodulin. Further studies are needed to unravel the mechanism and clinical relevance of these findings.ReferencesPorto BN et al. Front Immunol. 2016;7:311Singer M et al.

We examined the effect of different timing of tocilizumab, on mortality, in a cohort of adults with COVID-19.Methods:All adults (≥ 18 years old) with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to four hospitals in the West of Scotland between 8th Jan 2021 and 31st March 2021 and who received tocilizumab were included in a retrospective cohort study. Patients were assigned to either an early (day 0 or day 1 of admission) or late (days 2–7 of admission) cohort based on tocilizumab initiation. The primary outcome was 90 day all-cause mortality, in early versus late cohorts. Secondary outcomes were 28 and 180 day all-cause mortality.Results:203 patients were included (138 in the early cohort and 65 in the late cohort). Mortality was significantly higher in the late cohort compared to the early cohort (adjusted OR 3.33; CI 1.29 to 8.54;p= 0.012). The secondary outcomes demonstrated the same effect with higher rates of death at 28 days (late cohort adjusted OR 3.28; CI 1.23 to 8.75;p= 0.018) and 180 days (late cohort adjusted OR 3.70; CI 1.45–9.45;p= 0.006).

Extracorporeal hemoperfusion (EH) using Efferon LPS adsorber abrogates MOF and halts septic shock (SS) in adult patients [1]. Here, we report case series of children with sepsis to assess the feasibility and safety of EH with a new pediatric Efferon LPS NEO device (PE).Methods:PE contains porous polymeric scaffold with the surface-immobilized LPS-selective ligand. Seventeen children (9 girls) with sepsis (10 with SS), average age and range: 26 (1–159 months), were included in the study following Ethical Committee approval. Children received two treatments, lasted ≥ 4 h, 24 h apart, with PE. The blood cell count, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine, urea, ALT and AST were monitored on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14. Plasma IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF were determined on days 0 and 3 after the inclusion into the study. STATA 16.0 (StataCorp, USA) were used to assess significance.Results:In SS patients, EH resulted in: (a) early abrogation of shock as confirmed by a decrease in vasopressors dose (Figure panel D), (b) MOF reversal as determined by pSOFA (p= 0.003, Figure panel A), (c) lower creatinine (p= 0.006, Figure panel C) and C-reactive protein levels starting from days 2–3, (d) increases in PaO2/FiO2index on days 7 and 14 (p= 0.004, Figure panel B). Children exhibited significantly decreased cytokines levels concentration in 72 h post-EH (Figure panels F and G). In non-SS children, the cell ratio-based biomarkers exhibited early vs late prognosis for SII and NLR (Figure panels I and H, respectively). Decreased thrombocyte levels on days 1–3 post-EH were normalized on day 7. Only 2 of 17 most severely ill children with refractory SS have deceased by the 60 day.Conclusions:These results argue for feasibility and safety of EH with PE in pediatric sepsis.ReferenceRey et al.

Studies reporting a statistically significant mortality reduction using any treatment (drug, technique, or strategy) among adult critically ill patients were included in this review. We then searched for subsequent mRCTs addressing the same research question of the sRCT, and compared the consistency between sRCTs and mRCTs in terms of mortality findings when any mRCT was available.Results:We identified 19 sRCTs showing a significant mortality reduction in critically ill adults, with 16 sRCTs followed by at least one subsequent mRCT (24 trials in total). Among these 16 sRCTs, one (6%) was followed by a mRCT confirming a significant mortality reduction; 14 (88%) were followed by mRCTs with no significant mortality difference (Figure). The positive finding of one sRCT (6%) on intensive glycemic control was contradicted by a subsequent mRCT showing a significant mortality increase.Conclusions:Significant mortality reduction shown by sRCTs is rarely replicated by subsequent mRCTs.

While guidelines recommend urgent resuscitation in sepsis, optimization may require an understanding of pre-existing and sepsis-related cardiac dysfunction. Little is known about the epidemiology and impact of pre-existing dysfunction on sepsis resuscitation.Methods:We studied patients from 2013 to 2014 at 12 UPMC hospitals. We included patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 h of presentation and linked transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) findings and chronic β-blocker therapy up to 12 months prior. Outcomes included ICU admission and length of stay, and mortality at 28-days up to 3 years. Continuous data were presented as means with standard deviations; categorical variables as frequencies and percentages (Stata 18.0).Results:Among 513,281 patients, 31,052 met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 h of arrival, of whom 4599 had TTE data (mean age 65 (SD: 15 years), 49.5% male, 84% White). One in five had pre-existing cardiac dysfunction (974 of 4599): 715 (73%) with left ventricular (LV), 136 (14%) with right ventricular (RV), and 123 (13%) patients with biventricular (BV) dysfunction (Table). Overall, 45% received chronic β-blocker therapy (2056 of 4599), and 26% had pre-existing cardiac dysfunction (526 of 2056). Despite similar clinical presentation of sepsis, ICU admission was greater in patients with ventricular dysfunction (83% v. 67%), and vasopressor administration more common (BV: 51%, LV: 36%, RV: 33%, none: 23%). Mortality was higher among those with cardiac dysfunction; for instance, 25% for BV versus 18% for no dysfunction at 28 days and 52% versus 43% at 12 months.Conclusions:Pre-existing cardiac dysfunction was present in one in five sepsis patients with TTE data and over half received chronic β-blocker therapy. These patients experienced greater organ support, ICU admissions, and worse outcomes, despite similar sepsis presentations.Table (abstract P223)Characteristics before and after sepsis by TTE abnormality in the 12 months prior to sepsisCharacteristicNone (N = 3625)RV dysfunction (N = 136)LV dysfunction (N = 715)BV dysfunction (N = 123)Age, years, mean (SD)68"

The aim of the work was to compare the effect of NE alone and NE/V combination on hemodynamics, tissue perfusion and cardiac function in septic shock patients.Methods:Before-and-after non-experimental observational study, in septic shock patients: before, all patients received only NE; and after, all patients received a combination of NE and V, when NE dose was equal to or greater than 0.5mcg/kg/min, according to the SSC. The hemodynamic evaluation included echocardiography and a bioreactance device.Results:45 patients were included, 25 patients in the NE group and 20 patients in the NE/V group. 64.7% males, mean age of 68.2 years, with similar comorbidities and APACHE II scores. There was a decrease in the NE dose of 31.74% (p= 0.048) after 8–12 h of starting V in the NE/V group. There was a trend in the NE/V group towards higher mean arterial pressure, lower heart rate, and metabolic normalization (pH, base excess, and lactate), but it was not significant. The NE/V group had higher cardiac output (4.6 vs. 3.9 mL/min,p= 0.06) and higher left ventricular outflow tract velocity–time integral (LVOT-VTI) (19.6 vs. 17.9 cm,p= 0.04) than the NE group, despite having similarly left ventricular ejection fraction. There was no difference between the groups regarding mortality or other organ dysfunctions.Conclusions:In patients with refractory septic shock, there was a statistically significant decrease in the dose of NA after starting vasopressin and a higher cardiac output and LVOT-VTI in the NE/V group, suggesting that lower NE doses with the combination of vasopressin can improve cardiac performance and hemodynamic profile.ReferenceEvans L et al.

Based on national guidelines, the trial monitored participating Australian sites using central monitoring and limited source data verification (SDV). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic source data verification was completed remotely. Aim—To compare two approaches of remote SDV for clinical-trial monitoring: (1) UPLOADing of copies of source-data documents to a cloud-based platform list with off-line SDV (2) LIVE SDV via a video link (e.g., zoom) between the site and trial monitor. Objective—To evaluate the time, acceptability, user pReference and assess the quality of the monitoring using the two approaches.Methods:All Australian sites in the BALANCE trial were invited to participate in this study. Willing sites were randomised (1:1) between the two methods of SDV. Site staff (and the monitor) completed a worksheet recording key parameters of the SDV such as the time taken to locate and handle the documents. An anonymous survey of the staff members experience was also collected.Results:Out of 18 sites in Australia, 59% of the sites participated in SDV via LIVE monitoring while 41% via UPLOADing of documents. Amongst the sites randomised to LIVE method, an equal number (44%) of participants prefer face to face monitoring or LIVE monitoring over UPLOAD method. In comparison, sites that were randomised to UPLOAD method, only 33% of participants prefer UPLOAD method than face to face. However, none of the participants prefer UPLOAD method than LIVE method. Results of only anonymous survey are demonstrated. Analysis of the quantitative measures of time spent collecting documents, number of source documents required etc. is ongoing and will be presented.Conclusions:Remote monitoring via LIVE method is preferred than UPLOADing of documents by research staff participating in BALANCE trial.P226 The challenge of delayed intensive care unit admissionsM Sheik, M Abbas, J DixonEpsom & St Helier University Hospital NHS Trust, Critical Care Department, Surrey, UKCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P226Introduction:We aimed to study the effects of delayed intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and the impact of a policy to ensure emergency bed capacity.

    "full_text": "Increasing ICU admission capacity to mitigate delays potentially risks lowering the threshold for admission to patients who are either too well or, conversely, too unwell to benefit from ICU care.Methods:We conducted an observational study of two cohorts of patients which had delayed (DA) and non-delayed (Control) emergency admissions to ICU across 2 hospital sites. Delayed admissions were defined as admissions > 4 h. Prospective data were collected over five years before, and two years after, the policy change. Student t-test compared APACHE-2 scores and standardised mortality rate (SMR) pre and post policy.Results:Prior to policy change, the results show a DA rate of 8.8%; similar APACHE-2 scores in controls (15.46 ± 6.89; n = 4320) versus DA (15.51 ± 7.02, n = 410),p= 0.89; increased mortality in DA vs .controls (26.5% vs. 13.1%); SMR was 0.86 ± 0.07 in controls versus 1.26 ± 0.41 in DA,p< 0.0001. This corresponds to an estimated 11.2 ± 6.8 potentially avoidable deaths per year in the DA group across both hospitals. Following the policy change, DA were eventually eliminated. Pooled data showed SMR reduced from0.90 ± 0.60 (n = 4730) prior to policy change, to 0.81 ± 0.11 (n = 1750) after change (p< 0.0001).Conclusions:Delayed admissions have a statistically significant increased rate of mortality compared to non-delayed admissions even when mean APACHE-II scores are similar. Following the policy change a significant reduction in delayed admissions and decrease in mortality for all emergency admissions was observed. We conclude that spare emergency admission capacity in ICU has a mortality benefit and recommend the adoption of similar policies in other ICUs.P227 Effects of rotating shift work schedule on sleep parameters in healthy intensive care unit nursesA Ioannidis1, A Tsaloglidou1, C Papadopoulos2, N Pantelas3, D Komninou3, A Petsa3, K Founta3, C Sidera3, E Markidou3, T Kafkia11International Hellenic University, School of Health Sciences, Department of Nursing, Sindos-Thessaloniki, Greece,2Aristotle University, School of Medicine, Third Cardiology Department, Thessaloniki, Greece,3General Anticancer Hospital \"Metaxa\", Intensive Care Unit, Piraeus, GreeceCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P227Introduction:Rotating shift work schedules can disrupt the circadian rhythm and negatively affect sleep.

The mean PSQI score was 7.6 ± 0.32, while only 8 (36.4%) nurses had a PSQI score ≤ 5 which corresponds to good sleep quality. In total, there were 46 Fitbit recordings included in the analysis (Table). Reported sleeping time on the sleep diary and the time asleep measured by the smartwatch showed strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.87,p< 0.05). Moreover, the sleep parameters calculated by the smartwatch showed significant differences among the shift types. Sleep duration was longer after a night shift which could be attributed to the sleep deficit of the night shift. As hypothesized, the recordings after a night shift revealed an even poorer quality of sleep.Conclusions:The findings of this study suggest that rotating shift work schedules can negatively affect sleep parameters in healthy ICU nurses. Future research should focus on developing interventions to improve sleep quality and reduce the negative effects of shift work on health and well-being.Table (abstract P227)Sleep parameters measured by Fitbit Charge 5ParameterMorning shift (n = 14)Afternoon shift (n = 17)Night shift (n = 15)pTime asleep (hours)6.46.17.7< 0.05REM sleep cycles (n)4.43.73.4< 0.05REM sleep duration (%)22.818.514.6< 0.05Sleep score (%)787567< 0.05P228 Emergency bag bleep test: How much weight is too much?AC Casey, J Wright, R Coe, R JonesNorth Bristol NHS Trust, Intensive Care Medicine, Bristol, UKCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P228Introduction:The appropriate contents of emergency bags are widely debated but the impact of excessive weight is not considered [1]. We looked at the effects a lighter bag has on time to location and response times.Methods:15 volunteers were timed travelling 200 m, up 4 flights of stairs and back using our current bag (13.2 kg) and a stripped back bag (3.1 kg). We measured their response time, resting heart rates, heart rates on arrival and their processing time to ready equipment for intubation.Results:The increase in time with the heavier bag compared to lighter ranged from + 35 s to − 32 s, with a 12 s average increase. Participants were on average 9 bpm more tachycardic carrying the larger bag (range − 11 bpm to + 47 bpm). Participants felt the larger bag was \"horrible,\" \"hard work,\" their legs were \"burning,\" \"shaking,\" and were \"more likely to fall”. Processing time improved on average 2.2 s (range − 15 s to + 21 s) faster after the third time opening the bag, despite this being with the heavier bag.Conclusions:A lighter bag improves response time, practitioner satisfaction and results in a lower heart rate at arrival. Processing time did not reduce but improved on repetition, which shows that familiarity and regular exposure is important for speed of response. Overall, a lighter and more familiar bag means a faster response.ReferenceNowadly CD et al. Mil Med. 2023;188:e1678–84.P229 Does simulation training in an"

Instructional models offer guidelines for developing effective learning strategies in an intensive care context. This study aimed to (1) determine the association between student’s level of preparedness to manage acutely ill patients and their level of competence before and after a simulation course, (2) explore how the design of the course influenced students’ feelings of preparedness.Methods:Ten final-year medical students, while in an internship in the intensive care unit, participated in a one-month course designed with the 4C/ID model to learn acute care management [1]. Students’ feelings of preparedness and level of competence were measured before (pretest) and after (posttest) the course, as well as the correlation between these concepts. Then, two focus groups were conducted to provide a deeper understanding of the design factors of the course that affect feelings of preparedness.Results:Students’ feelings of preparedness scores on the post-test (M = 37, SD = 2.81) were significantly higher than on the pretest (M = 32, SD = 4.53) (p< 0.05). The level of competence on the post-test (M = 3, SD = 0.632) was significantly higher than on the pretest (M = 1, SD = 0.516) (p< 0.05). We did not find a correlation between these two concepts at the pretest (τb = − 0.064,p= 0.829). We found a strong correlation between the level of competence and students’ feelings of preparedness at the post-test (τb = 0.751,p< 0.05). Design factors that influence students’ feelings of preparedness include modeling examples, exposition to authentic learning tasks of adequate complexity, feedback, and teaching a structured strategy.Conclusions:A course designed with 4C/ID model improved students’ self-confidence related to acute care management with a strong alignment with the level of competence. These results could inform educators of the design course to teach critical care skills.ReferenceVandewaetere M et al.

This framework aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of disparities in healthcare processes and help authorities evaluate equity in care delivery by addressing the gap in tools for assessing health equity across various health conditions and treatments.Methods:The study utilized process mining techniques to analyze event logs, capturing all actions during patient care. This approach allowed for the examination of disparities in both single and multiple treatment steps as well as in the overall strategy of treatment delivery. The framework was applied to sepsis patients in the (ICU), with a specific focus on differences in treatment based on sex and English language proficiency. The techniques are generalized to a process mining framework for monitoring health equity.Results:The application of this framework revealed no significant disparities in the treatment of male and female patients with sepsis. However, a notable delay was observed in the initiation of treatment for patients with limited English proficiency, despite similar severity in their condition and subsequent treatment steps as their English-speaking counterparts (Figure).Conclusions:The process mining framework developed in this study offers a comprehensive method for assessing health equity, subsuming existing techniques that typically focus on isolated aspects of patient care. It provides valuable insights into healthcare disparities, thereby serving as a crucial tool for research and policy-making to promote more equitable healthcare delivery.Figure (abstract P230)Differences in treatment times for English speakers and non-English speakers.

Patients’ socio-demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records if they did not refuse to participate. The effect of the case position on its duration was determined using a linear regression model. The case position within the handoff was categorized as either before or after the median position. Covariates associated with case duration were included in the model (age, sex, Charlson comorbidities index, SAPS II score, number of organs supports the night before, center (ICU-1 or ICU-2), admission reason).Results:2485 individual cases nested in 169 morning handoffs and related to 494 patients stays were included. The mean (± SD) duration of the morning handoff was 60 (± 12.5) minutes in ICU-1 and 35.2 (± 10.6) minutes in ICU-2. The mean (± SD) duration of a case was 175 (± 108) seconds.

Then, support vector machine (SVM) models were built using the LUSs and LUFs as input features, and tenfold cross-validation and Bayesian optimization were applied for robustness.Results:The Table shows the performances of SVM models based on LU in the prediction of ICU admission. Among the previously proposed LUSs, LUS-C showed the highest Acc (82.4%), PPV (86.7%), and NPV (76.2%) values in the prediction of ICU admission. On the contrary, the LUS-A showed the highest AUC (79.0%). Moreover, when using individual LUFs as input for the SVM models, better predictions of ICU admission were obtained. In particular, when using LUF-1 (B-lines alone), higher performance values were obtained for all metrics in comparison with LUS-A and LUS-B. Finally, when using all individual LUFs together (LUF-4), instead of the original LUS-A, as input for the model, increases in Acc, NPV, and AUC values of 5.9%, 28.6%, and 7.7%, were respectively observed.Conclusions:The approach of using total values of LUSs seem to result in the loss of valuable information. In fact, by leveraging ML with individual LUFs, the prediction of ICU admission seems to be improved; nonetheless, warranting validation from clinical practice.ReferencesLeote J et al.

The most common complications were acute kidney injury (26.5%) and respiratory failure (23.5%). About 55% of the admissions required organ support such as blood products (40.2%), invasive mechanical ventilation (30.4%), inotropes and/or vasopressors (15.7%), dialysis (4.9%) or non-invasive ventilation (4.9%). Coagulopathy (B = 11.83, t = 5.22,p= 0.006), need for Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) (B = 10.09, t = 3.92,p= 0.017) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) values at admission (B = 0.035, t = 3.23,p= 0.032) were independent predictors of length of stay in HDP patients. We observed no maternal deaths and 20 fetal or neonatal deaths (20.0%).Conclusions:HDP and postpartum hemorrhage were the leading causes of ICU admission. We observed a high rate of organ dysfunction, mainly invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, which is consistent with other studies.P234A Peripartum hypertensive disorders: a sub-cohort outcome analysisI Pinto1, C Rodrigues2, D Cabral11Centro Hospitalar e Universitário Lisboa Norte, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Lisboa, Portugal,2Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Clinica Universitária de Medicina Intensiva, Lisboa, PortugalCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P234AIntroduction:The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia/eclampsia and hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome are the most frequent nonhemorrhagic diagnoses requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission in peripartum women. Data regarding factors predicting poor outcome in these patients is scarce.Methods:We analyzed a cohort of pregnant and postpartum women admitted to a tertiary ICU between January 2012 and January 2023. A sub-cohort of patients diagnosed with HDP was retrospectively selected. Main objective was to identify ICU length-of-stay (LoS) predictors. We used t-student test or Pearson correlation coefficient to identify significant associations between independent variables and LoS. A multiple linear regression model with selected variables was used to predict LoS.Results:A total of 49 patients were included, mean age was 32.51 ± 7.0 years. Mean LoS was 2.5 ± 2.5 days.

Preeclampsia was observed in 35 patients (71.4%), HELLP syndrome in 24 (49.0%) and eclampsia in 6 (12.2%). In a multiple linear regression, coagulopathy (B = 11.83, t = 5.22,p= 0.006), need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (B = 10.09, t = 3.92,p= 0.017) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) values at admission (B = 0.035, t = 3.23,p= 0.032) were independent predictors of LoS.Conclusions:To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate predictors of outcome in HDP patients. Our analysis suggests that specific complications, namely acute respiratory failure requiring IMV and coagulopathy may have an impact on these patients´ outcome. Although these results need further confirmation with prospective studies, our data can help to predict morbidity in critically ill peripartum women with HDP.P235 Experience “near miss” to postpartum hemorrhageLF Godinez Monroy, JA Villalobos Silva, C Zarazua Sosa, JA Garza CarrionHospital General de Ciudad Victoria, Critical Care, Ciudad Victoria, MexicoCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P235Introduction:Despite all preventive efforts, postpartum hemorrhage is the main cause of maternal mortality in developing countries in Latin America. Its most frequent causes are uterine atony, coagulation deficiencies, and obstetric trauma. 80% of cases are preventable [1].Methods:We searched data for 48 months to date (2021–2023). Historical retrospective, descriptive and comparative study, carried out in a second level hospital in northeastern Mexico. We evaluated categorical and numerical variables to analyze general characteristics of the population with major obstetric bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit.

Long-term symptoms are common in individuals surviving the acute phase of COVID-19, especially those treated in intensive care units (ICUs). Being unable to return to work from sick leave after severe illness is a marker of impeded recovery.Methods:In this cohort-study, we identified all working-age individuals with a COVID-19 discharge diagnosis from an ICU or hospital until 31st July 2020 in national registries. The ICU patients had age, sex, and county-matched population controls randomly assigned. The ICU patients were compared to the other groups on the number of sick leave-free days alive during the first year in multivariable ordinal logistic regression and the proportion of alive individuals on sick leave after one year using multi variable binary logistic regression to adjust for baseline characteristics.Results:We included 1405 COVID-19 ICU patients, 6895 Covid-19 hospital patients, and 5575 population controls. The ICU patients had a substantially higher burden of sick leave than the hospital patients and the population controls (Figure). ICU patients, in comparison to hospital patients, had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.18 (0.16–0.20, 95% confidence interval, CI) for at least one more sick leave-free days alive and ICU patients compared to population controls had an OR of 0.034 (0.029–0.040, 95% CI bothp< 0.001).

The Pictorial Fit-Frail scale (PFFS) is a quick, easy-to-use tool to assess frailty. It is validated in several clinical settings, but not in the ICU. Since 9/2022 we started to routinely ask patients and/or family members of patients aged ≥ 70 who are hospitalized for at least 24 h in the ICU, to complete the PFFS based on the patient's health status prior to hospitalization.Methods:A retrospective study. We collected from the electronic record demographic data, admission prognostic scores (APACHE2, SOFA), PFFS, and mortality status at 90 days from admission. We calculated the correlation between PFFS and prognostic scores. Patients were grouped based on 90-day mortality status. We compared baseline characteristics using t-test or chi-square, as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the association of clinical factors with mortality.Results:A total of 155 patients aged ≥ 70 were admitted to the ICU for at least 24 h during the study period (9/2022–5/2023). Of those, 125 (81%) filled the PFFS questionnaire. Pearson correlation coefficient between PFFS/APACHE2 and PFFS/SOFA were very low (0.02, and 0.08, respectively). Mortality at 90d was 42% for the entire cohort. No significant differences were found between the alive/dead groups regarding age, gender, BMI, and Diabetes. APACHE2, SOFA score, and PFFS were significantly higher in the mortality group (25.55, 8.75, and 0.35, respectively) compared to those who survived (21.35, 6.20. and 0.24, respectively;p< 0.001). In multivariate analysis (Figure), only the SOFA and PFFS were significantly associated with 90-day mortality.Conclusions:The PFFS has a low correlation with ICU well-accepted prognostic scores which shows that they are distinct constructs. The PFFS is associated with 90-day mortality of older critically ill patients, independent of other prognostic scores.Figure (abstract P242)The association of clinical factors with 90-day mortality (odds ratio with 95% CI). *PFFS grade reflects frailty severity.

However, the prognostic value of both biomarkers for mortality after cardiac surgery is unclear.Methods:We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study between 2018 and 2022 in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Logistic regression models were used to analyze the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) with peak concentrations of cTnT and CK-MB. Predictive performance of these models for in-hospital mortality was evaluated with c-statistics and calibration plots. To demonstrate clinical application, the net reclassification index (NRI) was calculated.Results:In 2032 CABG patients the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.2% (N = 24). Postoperative cardiac biomarkers were higher in patients who died compared to survivors (1.04 ug/L [0.54–2.45] vs. 0.51 ug/L [0.34–0.80]p< 0.001 for cTnT and 84.00 U/L [37.50–126.25] vs. 33.00 U/L [26.00–43.00]p< 0.001 for CK-MB). Prediction models with cardiac biomarkers enhanced calibration in high-risk patients, compared to EuroSCORE II alone, and correctly reclassified 38% (cTnT) to 46% (CK-MB) of patients with in-hospital mortality as high risk. CK-MB showed better calibration and better discrimination for in-hospital mortality compared to cTnT (c-statistic 0.88 vs. 0.86).Conclusions:Postoperative cardiac biomarkers add value to EuroSCORE II for the prediction of in- hospital mortality after elective CABG.

The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for the reduction of subjective perception of general health status associated with ICU stay in COVID-19 patients.Methods:Retrospective observational study of 186 COVID-19 patients discharged from the ICU, evaluated in a follow-up consultation between July 2021 and July 2023, at a tertiary center in Portugal, The patient’s subjective general health status is classified as a percentage. Data analysis included frequencies, Spearman correlation, Mann–Whitney and χ2test.Results:The statistically significant factors that we identified were hospitalization length of stay (p= 0.001, 95% CI − 0.35 to − 0.009, ρ − 0.236), days under sedation (p= 0.008, 95% CI − 0.34 to − 0.046, ρ − 0.194), days of invasive mechanical ventilation (p= 0.023, 95% CI − 0.31 to − 0.020, ρ − 0.17), days under corticosteroid therapy (p< 0.001, 95% CI − 0.34 to − 0.11, ρ − 0.254), and days under neuromuscular blockade (p= 0.005, 95% CI − 0.34 to − 0.058, ρ − 0.204). Age, sex, SAPS II and SOFA score on admission did not show statistical significance. The negative value of the Spearman correlation coefficient indicates an inverse correlation, meaning that as the hospitalization/sedation/ventilation days increase, the self-rated general health tends to decrease. However, it suggests a weak to moderate correlation between the variables. In this sample, 45.2% of patients reported feeling less than 80% of their pre-hospitalization well being.Conclusions:Critically ill COVID-19 patients can have a compromised quality of life after ICU discharge.

The aim of this study was to analyze the data of follow-up consultations in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.Methods:Retrospective descriptive analysis of 186 selected patients discharged from the ICU after hospitalization for COVID-19, evaluated in a follow-up consultation between July 2021 and July 2023, at a tertiary center in Portugal, 6 to 9 months after discharge.Results:A total of 186 patients were included, with a median age of 58 ± 12.9 years. 65.6% male and 34.4% female. 31.7% of patients were previously healthy, and 64% had a non-disabling chronic disease. The mean SAPSII was 33 ± 10.6 and the SOFA was 5 ± 2.7. Hospital stay lasted an average of 17.0 ± 29.5 days and 14.2 ± 17.8 days in intensive care. The mean time of invasive mechanical ventilation was 14.2 ± 13.3 days. 12.9% were placed on ECMO. 58.6% of patients received neuromuscular blockade with a mean duration of 6.9 ± 4.5 days. Corticosteroid therapy was widely used with 88.2% receiving corticosteroid therapy for a mean of 6.5 ± 8.9 days. 37.1% of patients were diagnosed with delirium in the ICU. During the follow-up consultation, 34.9% of patients described their stay in the ICU as good, 15.6% described it as anxiety-inducing, 13.4% associated it with fear, 9.7% as distressing and 26.3% had no memory of their ICU stay. 37.1% of patients reported mobility problems, 34.3% reported experiencing daily pain, 39.3% reported anxiety, 45.2% of patients reported feeling less than 80% of their pre-hospitalization well being. The mean EuroQol 5 (EQ-5D) score was 0.78.Conclusions:The follow-up after discharge from the ICU is important to evaluate and screen for post-intensive care syndrome.

Follow up clinics for ICU patients are increasingly being used in order to decrease long-term mortality and morbidity. However, the long-term mortality and causes of death are not thoroughly described.Methods:We report a cohort study on Swedish intensive care registry (SIR) patients admitted to an ICU between 2005 and 2016 with outcomes collected until June 2020. Patients diagnosed with sepsis were allocated to the sepsis group and all other patients to the non-sepsis group. The primary outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) for death in patients with sepsis compared to non-sepsis patients in a multivariable Cox model for the entire follow-up and predefined periods. The secondary outcome was the distribution of marginal risk ratios (mRRs) in multivariable multinomial model for causes of death between sepsis and non-sepsis patients.Results:We included 33,994 patients with sepsis and 280,635 without, with an overall median age of 65 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50–76) and 41.6% women. Median follow-up in survivors was 3071 (IQR, 2137–4136) days. The HR of death for sepsis versus non-sepsis was 1.02 (95% confidence interval 1.00–1.04,p= 0.032). Sepsis was associated with survival 0–30 days from admission but mortality during later study periods until 5 years from admission (Figure). Sepsis was associated with an increased mRR for infectious, other tumors, and urogenital causes of death. Non-sepsis was associated with an increased mRR for circulatory injuries, intoxications, and psychiatric causes of death.Conclusions:In our cohort, ICU patients with sepsis have a higher adjusted risk of death than other ICU patients. The risk of death from an infection remained increased also in the last study period 8–15.5 years after admission in sepsis patients.Figure (abstract P252)Line plots of hazard ratios for variables in a series of Cox"

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations and deaths in patients with community-acquired severe sepsis admitted to an ICU compared to the general population.Methods:This retrospective cohort study included 20,313 individuals with incident hospital-treated sepsis or infection identified through Swedish health care registries. Patients admitted between 2008 and 2019 and aged ≥ 18 were included. Each case was matched to 20 controls, and to remove confounding we applied entropy balancing. Cardiovascular event was defined as hospitalisation or death due to cerebral infarction, heart failure or myocardial infarction. To explore the impact of prior heart disease, we conducted a subanalysis on 5,477 patients with no history of heart disease.Results:Among the survivors, 14.5% had a cardiovascular event during the entire follow-up period, compared to 9.6% among the controls. Overall, the risk of cardiovascular events was higher in sepsis patients during the first four months after discharge (see Figure). The increased risk of cerebral infarction was limited to the first two months, myocardial infarction to the first three months, and heart failure to the first four months. Among the 5477 patients with no history of heart disease, the increased risk of incident cardiovascular event persisted for at least six months in comparison to their matched controls.Conclusions:In the first four months following discharge, sepsis survivors had a heightened risk of cardiovascular events compared to matched population controls. Subsequently, this elevated risk diminished. However, as patients with no history of heart disease had increased risk for at least 6 months after discharge, sepsis might be a risk factor for cardiovascular events and preventive measures should be considered.Figure (abstract P253)Adjusted hazard ratios of major cardiovascular events after severe sepsis.P254 Prevalence of post-intensive care"

In the present study, this database was used to investigate the prevalence of PICS 3 months after ICU discharge.Methods:The JPICS database is a system that registers patients' mobile phone numbers during hospitalization and automatically conducts a questionnaire survey on their living conditions, physical functions, cognitive functions, and mental health using a mobile phone short message system 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after ICU discharge. The prevalence of PICS 3 months after ICU discharge was investigated in patients admitted to the ICU between October 2022 and June 2023. PICS was defined as any one of the following functional impairments: a physical impairment was defined as a score of ≤ 90 points on the Barthel Index, cognitive impairment as a score of < 40 points on the Short-Memory Questionnaire, and mental disorder as a score of ≥ 8 points on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-anxiety or -depression.Results:84 patients who responded to the questionnaire were included in the analysis. Age was 70.5 years, male 63.1%, ventilated 60.7%, SOFA score 6 points at ICU admission, PICS prevalence was 66.7%, physical impairment 39.3%, cognitive impairment 46.4%, mental disorder 41.7% and multiple functional impairments were found in about 40% of the patients. In addition, 24% of patients complained of pain that occurred after ICU discharge and analgesic was required in approximately 30% of these patients.

On ICU admission subphenotypes [1] have been identified in patients admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that are prognostic of outcome and predictive of treatment response. We hypothesized that if these ARDS subphenotypes are assigned at ICU discharge, they are associated with one-year outcome.Methods:A secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study conducted in two Dutch ICUs between 2011 and 2014 was executed. Patients discharged alive from the ICU and of whom biomarkers were measured on the day of ICU discharge (− 2 or − 1 days) were included. Subphenotypes were adjudicated by using a previously published parsimonious model making use of plasma levels of bicarbonate, interleukin-8 and protein C to adjudicate patients into two groups, a hyperinflammatory and a hypoinflammatory subphenotype. Subphenotype distribution at ICU discharge, clinical characteristics, plasma protein biomarkers at ICU discharge and outcomes were analyzed.Results:Of the 1483 patients in our cohort, 6% (n = 86) were assigned to the hyperinflammatory and 94% (1397) to the hypoinflammatory subphenotype at ICU discharge. Patients adjudicated to the hyperinflammatory subphenotype were discharged with signs of more severe disease (higher SOFA scores (7 [IQR 5–9] vs. 4 [IQR 2–6],p< 0.001).

Their baseline admission characteristics, length of stay and mechanical ventilation, and their physical function at discharge from ITU were compared, as were re-admission rates and mortality within 90 days of discharge.Results:There were 53 patients in the DDH group and 108 in the DW group, and there were no differences in sex between groups. The DDH group were significantly younger (Median age 44 vs. 56.5 years,p< 0.001), had significantly lower APACHE II scores (12 vs. 16,p< 0.001), and were mechanically ventilated for significantly fewer days (2 vs. 4,p< 0.001). The number of days from extubation to a formal decision to discharge was significantly lower in the DDH group (2 vs. 5 days,p< 0.001). Fifty percent of DW patients were admitted to ITU having first been an inpatient, compared to 24.52% in the DDH group (p= 0.002). Physical function scores at discharge from ITU were significantly higher in the DDH group (median CPAx score 48 vs. 38,p< 0.001). There were no differences in re-admission or mortality.Conclusions:Discharge direct to home does not lead to an increased incidence of re-admission or death compared to patients discharged to a ward, and they are discharged with higher physical function scores. Age, illness severity, number of days ventilated, and inpatient status prior to ITU admission are favourable in DDH patients.P258 Green ICU: a proposed protocol to greenify intensive care: a single center experienceD Correia1, AR Silva2, B Queiroz2, S Travassos2, G Nobre de Jesus2, JM Ribeiro21Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte, Intensive Care Medicine department, Lisboa, Portugal,2Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Lisboa, PortugalCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P258Introduction:If healthcare in the global scale were a country, it would be the fifth biggest carbon emitter on the planet. This awareness has globally increased concern. Within the hospital, the intensive care unit (ICU) is one of the considerable waste generators. Although challenging, awareness regarding this issue is important, and measures can be undertaken to reduce this impact.Methods:A literature review identified the problem’s magnitude and potential targets for improvement regarding the environmental waste and pollution associated with the ICU. The project is running at an urban, tertiary care, university hospital. Accordingly, we identified and proposed an integrated pool of measurements designed to have impact on waste production and treatment at the ICU level.

For each measurement we selected a work group dedicated to its implementation. The first three listed are already implemented and the remaining ones are in assessment, logistics scouting and implementation process. Assessment of fulfillment by professionals revealed a high level of adhesion.Conclusions:There is an unavoidable environmental impact of health care in general. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce such impact by modulating simple practices.

With medical care contributing about 4.4% of CO2emissions through energy use and waste production, choices like reusing bronchoscopes versus single-use ones are being weighed due to their impact on waste and energy.Methods:Literature review assessed hospitals' practices on reusable and disposable bronchoscopes. A prospective single-center observational study was conducted to analyse key environmental indicators, including carbon footprint, water consumption and waste generation, number of items used, their weight and recyclability.Results:Reusable bronchoscopes are greener in manufacturing but use more water and energy in their lifecycle due to reprocessing. Despite comparable clinical effectiveness, single-use bronchoscopes do not minimize costs when considering expenses related to cross-infection. With this evidence, we hypothesized that in our ICU, the reusable bronchoscopes would be more environmentally friendly due to the energy source used in our hospital. In a national ranking analysis, our hospital was placed first as the most energetically efficient hospital—partially due to the use of solar panels as energy sources—and, in second place regarding hydric efficiency. We're changing our urban university hospital protocol to favour reusable bronchoscopes over single-use ones, except for emergencies such as difficult tracheal intubation and for restrictive periods.

The adoption of a strategic approach, emphasizing key metrics, and the utilization of electronic medical record (EMR) smart phrases emerge as pragmatic measures to streamline documentation processes and systematically monitor pertinent data [1].Methods:We prioritized two key improvement metrics—mobility goals and pressure ulcer prevention. The ICU leadership designed and implemented the following steps:Novel user-friendly EMR smart phrases for comprehensive data capture and best practices were created.Clear communication on the rationale behind these metrics to improve staff understanding.Implementation of training sessions and regular audits to ensure consistent and correct usage.The nurse documented daily patient status; if the prescribed interventions for mobility and pressure ulcer prevention were not met, then barriers were reported.Maintaining data accuracy with a feedback loops of email reports and meetings.Celebrated achievements and addressed improvement areas.Encouraging continuous improvement with staff feedback on smart phrase usability.Optimization of rounding strategies for effective communication and goal attainment.Regular huddles keeping everyone informed, fostering a culture of transparency and collective engagement.Results:After 6 months, nursing staff compliance with smart phrase use rose from 60 to 96%. Mobility goal attainment increased from a 6-month average of 50.6–77.4% (Figure), and pressure ulcer incidence dropped from 1.6/month to zero.Conclusions:By focusing on specific metrics and utilizing smart phrases in the EMR, you can streamline data collection and make it easier for staff to track and report on performance. Regular communication and a commitment to continuous improvement will be crucial in navigating the challenges of a high-volume, high-acuity ICU with a dynamic workforce.ReferenceKieffer et al.

Palliative Care (PC) in the ICU improves quality of life and, particularly end-of-life (EOL) care, by anticipating and addressing suffering when curative treatments are no longer indicated or effective. The benefits of PC in the ICU are clearly documented: improves symptom management and quality of life, shortens ICU and Hospital length of stay (LOS), and limits non-beneficial life-sustaining interventions [2]. Nevertheless, research highlights clinicians’ inaccuracy identifying PC needs and recognizing EOL patients. Recent evidence supports using tools like the Palliative Care Screening Tool (PCST), allowing early identification of patients in need of palliative care.Methods:Retrospective observational study at a Portuguese ICU over a period of 2 months. The aim was to quantify the prevalence of palliative care requirements, analyze and compare the 90-day and hospital mortality rates, length of stay, level of care, re-admissions and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) prescription. The PCST was employed to assess palliative care needs prevalence.Results:Among 135 ICU patients, 40.7% needed palliative care. 38.2% were in level 3 care. There was no difference in hospital or 90-day mortality between the two groups. PC group had longer hospital LOS, while ICU LOS showed no difference. Remarkably, 90% of readmissions were from the PC group (p< 0.001). Only 30.9% had electronically prescribed DNR directives (p< 0.001).Conclusions:The high rate of ICU admissions (40.7%) requiring PC highlights the need for better patient recognition and management. Tools like PCST aid clinical decision-making and assist clinicians in identifying appropriate levels of intervention. Future large-scale studies assessing morbidity and 6 months and 1-year mortality can provide deeper insights on palliative patients' needs and outcomes.ReferencesMercadante S et al.

PFCC is a compassionate approach to ICU care, where patients and families are essential members of the healthcare team. The benefits of PFCC are well known, but most publications and research derive from the global North and little is known about PFCC practices and barriers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In ICU, the complexity and vulnerability of the patient’s condition, family involvement, and work requires a high level of culturally sensitive practices.Methods:A 21-question survey based on international guidelines for FCC in neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICUs and a report from the task force of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine, was conducted in English and Spanish in a convenience sample of ICU HCPs in LMICs. Data were stored on a secure server with encryption and captured using Research Electronic Data Capture. This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref N22/10/117) of Stellenbosch University.Results:A total of 324 HCPs (Spanish = 66; English = 258) completed the survey from 24 countries across Asia = 47%, Latin America = 20%, Africa = 19% and the Middle East = 13%. The majority were ICU nurses and medical specialists (75%) and 47% worked in ICU for ≥ 10 years. While most indicated familiarity with PFCC (94%), only 56% reported it as part of their daily clinical practice. The commonest barriers to implementation of PFCC were lack of time (58%), shortage of manpower (51%) and concern about infection control (46%).Conclusions:Implementation of PFCC in LMICs can be improved, with further studies needed to overcome barriers and provide a roadmap to enable all stakeholders to benefit from PFCC. PFCC can promote cultural competence and diversity by involving patients and families in care planning and decision making.P263 Unlocking Maastricht III: anticipated gainsD Martins Fernandes1, F Dias2, A Cardoso-Fernandes3, A Silva4, C Basílio2, N Gatta2, R Roncon-Albuquerque Jr2, JA Paiva21Intensive Care Department, Areosa, Portugal,2Centro Hospitalar Universitário São João, Intensive Care Department, Paranhos, Portugal,3Unidade Local de Saúde Alto Minho, Internal Medicine Department, Viana do Castelo, Portugal,4Centro Hospitalar Tâmega e Sousa, Intensive Care Department, Penafiel, PortugalCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P263Introduction:To reduce the discrepancy between demand and availability of organs for transplantation, controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD) has gained momentum and became an accepted practice in many"

Despite the prevailing practice of curtailing medical interventions in futile cases, Portugal has yet to implement cDCD [1]. This study aims to predict the expected rise in organ donation from implementing such a program.Methods:Retrospective observational study, conducted in a Portuguese tertiary’s hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU), during 2019, including all deceased patients under 75 years of age, provided they had no neoplasia, infectious risk or significant renal or hepatic dysfunction. Timing of controlled suspension of treatment was determined upon the documented transition to comfort care. To identify potential donors a maximum agonic phase of 30 min for the liver and pancreas, 60 min for the lung, and 120 min for the kidney were used. Results were compared with donors and collected organs from the same hospital and timeframe.Results:Among 311 deaths, 152 occurred after suspension of organ support. Most of patients were male (67%), with a mean age of 68 years and a mean SAPS II of 57. Mean ICU length of stay was 4 days and mean time from admission to withdrawal of organ support was 1 day. The most frequent form of organ support was invasive mechanical ventilation (74%). In the subgroup analysis 10 individuals (6.6%) died within less than 120 min, potentially providing 3 livers, 3 pancreases, 8 lungs, and 20 kidneys for transplantation. This would result in a 21% annual growth in transplantation activity in this hospital.Conclusions:This study anticipates a significant increase in organ donation from implementing cDCD, with important public health and social impact, aligned with ethical end-of-life care in ICU.ReferenceCouncil of Europe European Committee on Organ Transplantation & European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare, 2021.P264 Outcomes of critically ill super-elderly patients admitted to intensive care units in a middle-income country: a multicentric cohort studyG Moralez1, G Martins2, I Faria2, M Pitrowsky2, M Balbi2, L Bastos3, J Salluh21D´Or Institute for Research and Education, Intensive Care, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,2D´Or Institute for Research and Education, Critical Care, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,3Pontificia Universidade Catolica - PUC, Industrial engineer, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilCritical Care2024,28(Suppl 1):P264Introduction:CAP admissions are a major cause of ICU for elderly patients.

It also involves giving meaning to care for healthcare providers, avoiding moral distress and the risk of burnout associated with the administration of deemed inappropriate care.Methods:We organize a weekly meeting with the ICU team and the palliative team. We evaluated all the patients to define a therapeutic project adapted to each one. We studied the impact of this program on the caregivers (5 MDs, 53 nurses, 2 physiotherapists, 1 social assistant) and its impact on the ethical climate in the ICU.Results:100% of the caregivers participated in the study and responded with yes/no/less (Y/N/L) to questions about end-of-life (see Table).Conclusions:This approach allows for the development of a therapeutic project tailored to each patient, avoiding the initiation or continuation of unreasonable or futile treatments.

Definition of EOL is used when a patient is likely to die within the next 12 months. Palliative care is not spread among Portuguese hospitals and these patients might not be identified. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of EOL patients in our unit and to compare their 90-day and in-hospital mortality rates, days of hospitalization and 30-day re-hospitalization with patients who were not at EOL.Methods:Retrospective and observational study, including patients discharged from April to May/2023. We applied the criteria of Gold Standards Framework—Proactive Identification Guidance (GSF-PIG) organ failure specific indicators to identify EOL patients. We compare EOL group with non-EOL group.

The severe shortage of donors across all organs remains the major constraint.Methods:To evaluate how and why organ harvesting has improved since the beginning of donor program (2009). Observational retrospective study of all patients admitted to the ICU as potential donors. Patients were divided in 2 groups: the effective donors and those who did not fulfil criteria for transplant. Age, gender, admission diagnosis, organs harvested and reasons for refusal were recorded.Results:We enrolled 94 donors, 44 men, mean age of 65 years. Were harvested 217 organs: 3 hearts, 10 lungs, 3 pancreas, 81 livers, 122 kidneys, along with corneas, heart valves, and bones. Haemorrhagic stroke was the major cause of admission (47.3%), followed by ischemic stroke (20.4%), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (18.3%) and intracranial hypertension (14.0%). The elderly patients’ prevalence and the Neurosurgery absence, forcing some patients’ transfer to other hospital, were the reasons why neurovascular causes surpass neurotrauma. Brain death criteria not achieved, irreversible organ disfunction, neoplastic disease not excluded and personal opting-out also prevented harvesting on some occasions.Conclusions:Small hospitals with motivated and informed clinicians may support organ donation. Our hospital has invested in qualification regarding detection and good management, achieving 8 clinicians and 3 nurses with Transplant Procurement Management formation. The proximity between ICU and the emergency service, the creation of internal emergency teams and the rapid stroke diagnosis pathway, an alert system based in the NEWS where all patients with neurological depression are referred to the ICU with an emergent text message and the more extended criteria, especially age, are crucial for increasing of donors.

Given the ongoing and emergent phenomenon of immigration, underlying attitude of individuals migrated from other countries is becoming an important part of the donation process.Methods:Retrospective observational study (2019–2023) including all Lombardy donors. Data were obtained from the Lombardy Donor Record System “Donor Manager”. General demographic and descriptive variables were collected. Quantitative variables are expressed as mean ± SD for normal distribution and median (IQR 25–75) for non-normal. Qualitative variables are expressed as percentage.Results:Two hundred forty-nine foreign-born potential donors were considered. Mean age was 45 ± 15 years. Males accounted 64% (n = 160) of the sample. Two hundred thirty-eight (96%) were eligible for donation, refusal rate was 47% (n = 116), with no age or sex difference compared to non-refusal group (p= 0.22;p= 0.61 respectively). Refusal rate was almost two times higher, compared to Italian-born population (26%). Among eligible foreign-born donors, 65% (n = 154) were extra-EU born and had a higher rate (54% vs. 39% in EU born) of donation refusal (p= 0.04). Moreover, by dividing eligible foreign-born donors into different continents we assessed refusal rate, showing a significant difference (p< 0.01). Africa was the continent with the highest refusal rate (66%), followed by Asia (53%), Europe (39%) and America (29%) (Figure).Conclusions:In this Italian subset of foreign-donor population the refusal rate was almost doubled compared to the Italian rate, interestingly it is even higher in non EU born immigrants. Our results underline the importance of different social approaches to different cultures, the importance of talking with local foreign communities and building trust in the health institution, from access to care to the possibility of organ donation.Figure (abstract P269)All the plots illustrate refusal (red) and non-refusal (green) rate of eligible donors. EU = Europe; AFR = Africa; AM = America. In plotAand plotBare displayed foreign-born donors divided by Europe and Extra-Europe born and by continent of birth. In plotCwe wanted to show the comparison of refusal rate between foreign-born donors and Italian donors."
