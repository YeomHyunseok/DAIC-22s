Ms. Hughes hasserved as A guiding light for ATLS from ils inception in Nebraska, to its adoptionby the American College of Surgeons, through seven editions published from herdesk over 25 years. Irvene's commitment to quality, devotion to the program, andtireless efforts 011 behalf of the ATLS family were instrumental to the success of thisinternational treasure. We, as her ATLS family, wish to thank Irvene for settingthe example we attempt to follow.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Traumahas taught the ATLS course to over 1 million doctors in more than 50 countries. ATLS hasbecome the foundation of care for injured patients by teaching a common language and acommon approach. The 8th edition was created using an international, multidisciplinary, andevidence-based approach. The result is an ATLS program that is contemporary and mean-ingful in the global community.\n\n-John Fildes, MD, FACSChair, AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURG EONS COMMITTEE ON TRAUMA\n\nThe American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded toimprove the care of surgical patients, and it has long been aleader in establishing and maintaining the high quality ofsurgical practicein North America. In accordance with thatrole, the ACS Committee on Trauma (COT) has worked toestablish guidelines for the care of injured patients.\n\nAccordingly, the COT sponsors and contributes to thecontinued development of the Advanced Trauma Life Sup-port (ATI.S) Program for Doctors. The ATLS StudentCourse does nol present new concepls in the field of traumacare; rather, it teaches established treatment methods.A sys-tematic、 concise approach to the early care of trauma pa-tients is the hallmark of the ATLS Program.\n\nThis eighth edition was developed for the ACS by mem-bers of the Subcommittee on ATLS and the ACS COT,otherindivid ual Fellows of the College, members of the interna-tional ATLS community, and nonsurgical consullants to theSubcommittee who were selected for their special compe-tence in trauma care and their expertise in medical educa-tion. (Please see the listing at the end of the Preface and theAcknowledgements section for names and affiliations ofthese individuals.) The COT believes that those individualswho are resp onsible for caring for injured patients will findthe information extremely valuable. The principles of pa-tienl care presenled in this manual may also be beneficialfor the care of patients with nontrauma-related diseases.\n\nInjured patients present a wide range of complex prob-lems. The ATLS Student Course presents a concise approachto assessing and managing multiply injured patients. Thecourse presents doctors with knowledge and techniques thatare comprehensive and easily adapted to fit their needs. Theskills described in this manual represent one safe way to per~form each technique. The ACS recognizes that there areother acceptable approaches. However, the knowledge andskills taught in the course are easily adapted to all venues forthe care of these patients.\n\nThe ATLS Program is revised by the ATLS Subcom-millee approximately every four years to respond 10changes in available knowledge and incorporate newer andperhaps even safer skills. ATLS Committees in other coun-tries and regions where the Program has been introduced\n\nhave participated in the revision process, and the ATLS Sub-committee appreciates their outstanding contributions. Na-tional and international educators review the educationalmaterials to ensure that the course is conducted in a man-ner that facilitates learning. All of the course content isavailable in other resources, such as textbooks and journals.However, the ATLS Course is a specific entity, and the man-uals, slides, skill procedures, and other resources are usedfor the entire course only and cannot be fragmented intoseparate, freestanding lect ures or practical sessions. Mem-bers of the ACS COT and the ACS Regional andState/Provincial Committees, as well as the ACS ATLS Pro-gram Office staff members, are responsible for maintain-ing the high quality of the program. By introducing thiscourse and maintaining ils hi gh quali ty, the COT hopes toprovide another instrument by which to reduce the mor-tality and mor bidity related to trauma. The COT recom-mends that doctors participating in the ATI.S StudentCourse reverify their status every four years to maintainboth their current status in tbe program and their knowl-edge of current ATLS core content.\n\nThis eighth edition of the Advanced Trauma Life Supportfor Doctors Student Course Manual reflects several changesdesigned to enhance the educational content and its visualpresen tation.\n\nAll chapters were rewritten and revised to ensure clear COV-erage of the most up-to-date techuical content, which is alsorepresented in updated references. New to this edition are:\n\n▶▶ New Sample Trauma Flow Sheet (Appendix D)\n\n▶▶ Disaster Management and EmergencyPreparedness (Appendix H)\n\n▶▶ Skill X-8:Atlanto-occipital Joint Assessment\n\n▶▶ Updated airway management algorithm\n\n▶▶ Updated pelvic fracture management algorithm\n\nYou'll also nole the inclusion of a DVD with this edition.This new course component includes video of criticalskillsthat doctors should be familiar with before taking the-course. Skill Stations during the course will allow doctorsthe opportunity to fine tune skill performance in prepara-tion for the practical assessment. Review of the demon-strated skills prior to participating in the skills stations willenhance the learner's experience.\n\nThis edition features a new full-color design, along with newcolor photographs and medical illustrations. Content waspresented in a narrative format rather than outline for easeof readability. In addition, an effort was made to augmentthe pedagogical features of the textbook to improve studentcomprehension and retention of knowledge. Look for thefollowing features:\n\nThis feature provides a \"road map tothe chapter content\n\nThese questions are aligned with theinstructor's PowerPoint presentations toprepare students for key discussionsduring lectures\n\nSentences appear in red font toattract the reader's attention to keypoints of information.\n\nCross-references to other chapters,Skill Stations, and additional resourceshelp to pull all of the information together\n\nPITFALLTheseboxes highlight critical pitfalls to avoid while caring for trauma patientsCHAPTER SUMMARYChapter thesummaries tie back to the Chap- ter Objectives to ensure understanding of most pertinent chap ter content\n\nThe ACS Committee on Trauma is referred to as the ACSCOT or the Committee, and the State/Provincial Chair(s) isreferred to as S/P Chair(s).\n\n'I'he international nature of this edition of the ATLSStudent Manual may necessitate changes in commonly used\n\nterms to facilitate understanding by all students and teach-ers of the Program.\n\nAdvanced Trauma Life Support� and ATLSⓚ are pro-prietary trademarks and service marks owned by theAmerican College of Su rgeons and cannot be used by in-dividuals or entities outside the ACS COT organizationfor their goods and services without ACS approval.
