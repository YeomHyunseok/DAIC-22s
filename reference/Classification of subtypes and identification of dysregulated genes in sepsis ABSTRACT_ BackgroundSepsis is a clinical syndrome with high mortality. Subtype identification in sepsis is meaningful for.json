Subtype identification in sepsis is meaningful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The purpose of this research was to identify subtypes of sepsis using RNA-seq datasets and further explore key genes that were deregulated during the development of sepsis.MethodsThe datasetsGSE95233andGSE13904were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential analysis of the gene expression matrix was performed between sepsis patients and healthy controls. Intersection analysis of differentially expressed genes was applied to identify common differentially expressed genes for enrichment analysis and gene set variation analysis. Obvious differential pathways between sepsis patients and healthy controls were identified, as were developmental stages during sepsis. Then, key dysregulated genes were revealed by short time-series analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model. In addition, the MCPcounter package was used to assess infiltrating immunocytes. Finally, the dysregulated genes identified were verified using 69 clinical samples.ResultsA total of 898 common differentially expressed genes were obtained, which were chiefly related to increased metabolic responses and decreased immune responses. The two differential pathways (angiogenesis and myc targets v2) were screened on the basis of gene set variation analysis scores. Four subgroups were identified according to median expression of angiogenesis and myc target v2 genes: normal, myc target v2, mixed-quiescent, and angiogenesis. The genes CHPT1, CPEB4, DNAJC3, MAFG, NARF, SNX3, S100A9, S100A12, and METTL9 were recognized as being progressively dysregulated in sepsis. Furthermore, most types of immune cells showed low infiltration in sepsis patients and had a significant correlation with the key genes. Importantly, all nine key genes were highly expressed in sepsis patients.ConclusionThis study revealed novel insight into sepsis subtypes and identified nine dysregulated genes associated with immune status in the development of sepsis. This study provides potential molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. BODY: 1IntroductionSepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction stemming from host response imbalance to infection. In 2017, 48.9 million septic events were reported worldwide, with 11 million sepsis-associated deaths recorded, accounting for 19.7% of total global deaths (Rudd et al., 2020). In the United States, the costs associated with sepsis treatment amounts to at least $24 billion annually (Liu et al., 2014). Sepsis is a major cause of health concern globally due to its high morbidity, high mortality, and huge economic burden (Weng et al., 2023). The World Health Organization has proposed that member states strive to identify, record and treat sepsis. Sepsis is a"

Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome with complex and variable pathophysiological mechanisms, necessitating identification of different clinical biomarkers and phenotypes for precise therapy and optimization of outcomes (Liu et al., 2020;Komorowski et al., 2022).With the development and wide application of high-throughput sequencing technology, bioinformatics analysis could be used to identify sepsis biomarkers and/or subclasses (Zhao et al., 2021). Zeng et al. found that MAPK14, FGR, RHOG, LAT, and PRKACB were progressively maladjusted in patients with sepsis and septic shock (Zeng et al., 2021). Li et al. found that sepsis-related pathways could be utilized for disease diagnosis, classification, and prognosis (Li et al., 2023). A study based on hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles of neutrophils and partitioning around medoids was performed to distinguish sepsis subtypes, which were related to sepsis severity (Maslove et al., 2012). Zhang et al. identified two types of sepsis that showed different mortality and reaction to hydrocortisone therapy (Zhang et al., 2020b). Qi et al. explored some mitochondria-related genes to identify the molecular subtypes in sepsis (Shu et al., 2023). At present, there is no research on the classification of sepsis subtypes based on genes expression of differential pathways and validation of the key dysregulated genes in the development of sepsis based on clinical samples.In addition, the immune response plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and development of sepsis. Immune cells release inflammatory mediators and cytokines aimed at eliminating potential pathogens in the early stage; immune-suppressive mechanisms appear in the late stage during sepsis, resulting in immune dysfunction (Zhang et al., 2023). Bioinformatics research has suggested that SLC2A6 was associated with sepsis-related mortality and correlated positively with infiltration levels of Th1 cells (Li et al., 2021). Research indicated SIGLEC9, TSPO, CKS1B, PTTG3P were significantly associated with infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes during sepsis (Ming et al., 2022). It is of great significance in clinical practice to explore the immune response aspect that is important in the development of sepsis, search key genes associated with immune cells, and elucidate the mechanisms and functions of the molecules and cells involved.In this research, we analyzed gene expression profiles of sepsis patients in a public database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and perform enrichment analysis. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores were determined to identify the highest and lowest pathways for dividing sepsis development stages. Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model were used to identify key genes in sepsis development.

Finally, we used clinical samples to validate key genes by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). This research not only divided the development stages of sepsis according to differential pathways but also systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration in sepsis. Our findings provide novel ideas for augmenting the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.2Materials and methods2.1Sepsis data sourceTwo sepsis-related datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The normalized gene expression matrix was retrieved. We included gene expression profiling based on whole-blood arrays from theGSE95233dataset (including 102 sepsis patients and 22 healthy controls) and theGSE13904dataset (including 158 sepsis children and 18 healthy children). All samples collection time point were shown in theSupplementary Tables 1,2. We applied the stat and dplyr packages in R to annotate and normalize the raw data in these two datasets.2.2Differential gene expression screeningDifferential analysis was performed using the limma package of R to screen DEGs between the sepsis and control groups of theGSE95233andGSE13904datasets (Ritchie et al., 2015). DEGs were defined as |log2-fold change| > 0.5 andP< 0.05. Then, the filtered DEGs from the two datasets were merged to obtain intersection sets. Furthermore, DEGs with the same expression trend (upregulated or downregulated) in the two datasets between the sepsis and healthy control groups were further analyzed.2.3Enrichment analysisMultiple pathway datasets (Hallmark, C1-C8 collections) were obtained from Molecular Signatures Database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb). To explore related biological processes, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out to implement pathway enrichment analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes.P< 0.05 was deemed to be statistically significant for enrichment analysis. The results of GSEA were displayed using the fgsea package in R.GSVA was performed for the enrichment results in the GSVA package of R, and GSVA enrichment scores of each pathway were acquired (HÃ¤nzelmann et al., 2013;Yu et al., 2021). Afterwards, we compared GSVA scores between the sepsis and control groups using the limma package in R, so as to identify the upregulated and downregulated pathways in septic patients relative to healthy controls.2.4Division of development stages in sepsisGenes belonging to the highest and lowest pathways in the GSVA scores of the two datasets were extracted. Consensus clustering was implemented to select co-expressed genes of the highest and lowest pathways by the ConsensusClusterPlus package in R (Karasinska et al., 2020;Qiu et al., 2021). The parameters were set as follows: reps = 1000, pItem =0.8, pFeature =0.8. Then, median levels"

    "full_text": "pItem =0.8, pFeature =0.8. Then, median levels of co-expressed genes were calculated to divide sepsis samples of theGSE13904dataset into four developmental stages.2.5Short time-series expression miner analysisWe performed STEM analysis of theGSE13904dataset to cluster the common genes in four developmental stages of sepsis (Ernst and Bar-Joseph, 2006). The clustering module withP< 0.05 was defined as a significant clustering module. The significantly clustered genes displayed a more obvious trend of upregulation or downregulation. The genes of the significant module for pathway enrichment analysis were obtained using the GlueGO plug-in of Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).2.6Model buildingWe used the LASSO method for dimension reduction analysis of module genes and 5-fold cross validation to extract key genes in sepsis development (Kanwal et al., 2020). Subsequently, we performed logistic regression and random forest methods to evaluate the prediction performance of selected key genes. 5-fold cross validation was conducted to evaluate the prediction efficiency of the LASSO-selected genes. Meanwhile, we calculated the correlation between selected key genes using the circlize package in R.In addition, we arranged and combined the selected key genes to construct possible logistic regression models. The areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of each logistic regression model were calculated.2.7Microenvironment cell populations-counter analysisMarker genes of immune cell types were acquired as described byBindea et al. (2013). To estimate immune cell infiltration of samples in theGSE13904dataset, we used the microenvironment cell populations-counter algorithm with the MCPcounter package in R (Becht et al., 2016). This method stably quantified the abundance of different immunocytes. In addition, Pearsonâs correlation analysis was applied to calculate correlations between infiltration levels by different types of immunocytes, as well as correlations between key genes and various infiltration of immunocytes.2.8RT-qPCR analysis of key genes2.8.1ParticipantsTo further validate the potential application of key genes for the diagnosis of sepsis in clinical practice, we selected in-hospital sepsis patients and non-sepsis patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from June 2022 to December 2022. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: age < 18 years, ICU stay length < 24 h, pregnancy or lactation, malignancy, receiving immunosuppressive treatment, and AIDS patients. The patients were included in the sepsis group if they met the sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria (Singer et al., 2016). The inclusion criteria for the non-sepsis patients were hospitalization in the ICU owing to diseases other than sepsis during the same period.

Whole blood from patients within 24 h of diagnosis of sepsis or non-sepsis was collected in a 5 ml EDTA tube; red blood cell lysis buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) was added, and the sample was fully mixed, followed by centrifugation to isolate nucleated cells for subsequent analysis.2.8.3RNA extraction and RT-qPCRTotal RNA of whole blood from enrolled patients was extracted with RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

A total of 3581 DEGs in theGSE95233dataset (Figure 2A) and 1284 DEGs in theGSE13904dataset (Figure 2B) were obtained. By comparing DEGs between the two datasets, we observed that 898 genes were common to both (Figure 2C). Specifically, we found that 774 DEGs were upregulated (Figure 2D) and 123 DEGs downregulated (Figure 2E) in the two datasets. These genes at the intersection could be closely related to both adult sepsis and pediatric sepsis.Figure 1The flow chart of this research.

These GSEA results revealed the genes upregulated in sepsis to be mainly enriched in metabolism-related pathways; downregulated genes were principally enriched in immune-associated pathways. In addition, we used the hallmark gene set to obtain signaling pathways in which the DEGs between the sepsis and control groups in theGSE95233andGSE13904datasets were involved.

On the basis of the median expression levels of co-expressed genes, we assigned the sepsis samples of theGSE13904dataset to four stages: myc targets v2 (angiogenesis â¤ 0, myc targets v2 > 0), mixed (angiogenesis > 0, myc targets v2 > 0), quiescent (angiogenesis â¤ 0, myc targets v2 â¤ 0), angiogenesis (angiogenesis > 0, myc targets v2 â¤ 0) (Figure 4B).

In order to screen progressive dysregulation genes during the development of sepsis, we utilized STEM analysis to identify common genes. These common genes fell into four significant clusters (Figure 5A). The U42 cluster showed an obvious upregulation trend in the following order: normal < myc targets v2 < mixed-quiescent < angiogenesis (Figure 5B). Next, we preformed pathway enrichment analysis of genes in the U42 cluster.

These key genes correlated positively with each other (Figure 5D). The nine key genes were upregulated in sepsis compared with healthy controls (Supplementary Figures 2A, B). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves of nine genes in the logistic regression and random forest models in the internal validation were 0.957 and 0.987, respectively (Figure 5E), which indicated that these nine genes could well predict sepsis development.3.5Immune cells infiltration in sepsisWe identified infiltration of ten immune cell types inGSE13904by microenvironment cell populations-counter analysis (Figure 6A). The results showed that the relative abundances of neutrophils and endothelial cells in sepsis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy patients; the relative abundances of B lineage cells, T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and NK cells were lower. Correlation results between immune cells suggested remarkable positive correlations for fibroblasts and CD8 T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes and T cells (Figure 6B).

In this study, we employed GSVA to identify two differential pathways (angiogenesis and myc targets v2) between sepsis patients and healthy controls. Based on the co-expressed genes of the two pathways, we divided sepsis into four stages: normal, myc targets v2, mixed-quiescent, and angiogenesis. We further used STEM and LASSO analyses to screen nine key genes, CHPT1, CPEB4, DNAJC3, MAFG, NARF, SNX3, S100A9, S100A12, and METTL9, which were progressively dysregulated during the development of sepsis and had important diagnostic functions. More importantly, clinical samples from the ICU verified higher expression of the nine genes in sepsis patients than in non-sepsis patients, which supported the bioinformatics results.CHPT1 is a key enzyme that participates in the synthesis of glycerophospholipids, catalyzing phosphatidylcholine synthesis and regulating choline metabolism (Wang et al., 2021). Metabolomics analysis demonstrated that serum concentrations of glycerophospholipids and the glycerophospholipid were significantly altered in sepsis (Wang et al., 2021). Our previous research also found that compared with the sham operation group, the plasma metabolites of septic rats involved in the metabolism of glycerol phospholipids and amino acids were significantly changed (Cui et al., 2020). CPEB4, a sequence specific RNA-binding protein, exits in the 3â untranslated region of some mRNAs (Ivshina et al., 2014). Research showed CPEB4 could stabilize anti-inflammatory transcripts containing AU-rich elements and cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements in the 3â untranslated region, which was necessary to solve the inflammatory response triggered by lipopolysaccharide (SuÃ±er et al., 2022). Sibilio et al. found that CPEB4 mediated repair and remodeling of acute inflammatory tissue injury (Sibilio et al., 2022). Inflammation and cell stress can result in the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Kim et al., 2013). Similarly, persistent ER stress can also trigger and aggravate inflammation through multiple mechanisms (Zhang and Kaufman, 2008). Research has shown that stress-induced loss of dynamic balance in ER function was closely related to the progression of sepsis (Gong et al., 2022), and DNAJC3 could defend cells against ER stress in response to unfolded proteins (Pauwels et al., 2022).

    "full_text": "acts as a heterodimer chaperone with Nrf2 (Li and Zhan, 2022). Sepsis leads to redox imbalance, which is characterized by excessive production of reactive oxygen species. MAFG and Nrf2 were highly involved in the regulation of numerous antioxidant genes at the transcriptional level, and the Nrf2 signaling pathway could respond to excessive reactive oxygen species (Caggiano et al., 2017). NARF is a protein-coding gene that is related to mitochondria and iron-sulfur cluster binding (Ding et al., 2020). Iron-sulfur cluster, a redox regulator, is known for its role in mediating electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Read et al., 2021). Research showed that the iron-sulfur cluster could regulate oxidative stress through superoxide reactive protein, which might affect the progression of sepsis (Kobayashi et al., 2014). SNX3 belongs to the endosomal protein sorting nexin family, which participates in vesicular transport events, including autophagy and endocytosis (Maruzs et al., 2015). Promoting autophagy could alleviate sepsis-related organ injury, which might be a new treatment for sepsis (Sun et al., 2021). S100A9, a proinflammatory alarmin, was upregulated in a variety of infectious diseases (Holzinger et al., 2019;MarinkoviÄ et al., 2020). A study found that targeting S100A9 could reduce neutrophil recruitment and lung accumulation in sepsis, thereby improving sepsis-related lung injury (Ding et al., 2021). S100A9 usually binds with S100A8 to form heterodimer, which plays an important role in the inflammation (Wang et al., 2018). S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer was reported to help stratify and predict mortality in the septic shock patients (Dubois et al., 2020). Similarly, Davydova et al. suggested that septic shock patients with high levels of S100A12 and S100A8/A100A9 at admission might have a higher risk of death (Dubois et al., 2019). S100A12, similar to S100A9, belongs to the S100 gene family, which plays essential immune response role in inflammation-related diseases (Shah et al., 2017). The research indicated that expression of S100A12 and S100A9 in the peripheral blood of sepsis patients was upregulated compared with that of healthy controls (Uhel et al., 2017), which was consistent with our results. Another study reported that S100A12 promoted inflammation in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2020a). METTL9 is widely specific methyltransferase (Davydova et al., 2021). Daitoku et al. identified that METTL9 catalyzed formation of NÏ-methylhistidine in the S100A9, weakening its affinity for zinc (Daitoku et al., 2021). Given that S100A9 might play an antibacterial role by chelating the zinc necessary for growth of pathogenic bacteria, METTL9 mediated S100A9 methylation may participate in the innate immune response to infection.Enrichment analysis revealed significant upregulation of metabolic-related pathways and downregulation of"

    "full_text": "metabolic-related pathways and downregulation of immune-related pathways in sepsis. It was reported that sepsis may lead to increased aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, abnormal fatty acid metabolism, and impaired oxygen supply (Ping et al., 2021). PKM2-dependent aerobic glycolysis promoted macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide to release HMGB1 and IL-1Î² (Xie et al., 2016). Numerous studies have indicated that immunosuppression was a factor for increased susceptibility to mortality and secondary infection in sepsis, and most sepsis-mortality occurred in hypo-inflammation (Gandhirajan et al., 2021;Torres et al., 2022). Severe depletion of dendritic cells might be used to predict sepsis outcome in the early stage (Weber et al., 2015). Besides, sepsis-induced lymphopenia was more prominent in sepsis non-survivors than in survivors (Yao et al., 2022).Sepsis could damage the innate and adaptive immune responses, which made it impossible to control various types of infections (McBride et al., 2020). Analysis of immune cell infiltration in sepsis patients indicated that most types of immunocyte infiltration decreased, except infiltration by neutrophils and endothelial cells. Due to delayed neutrophil apoptosis, neutrophils level rapidly increased in sepsis (Zhang et al., 2023). The delayed neutrophil apoptosis and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps occurred together with long-term endothelial damage and organ dysfunction (Denning et al., 2019). A significant decrease in lymphocytes (especially CD4 T lymphocytes) was well characterized in sepsis (Martin et al., 2020). In addition, circulating counts of mucosal-associated invariant T cells, natural killer T cells, and gamma delta T cells decreased significantly, the extent of which was related to increased infection risk (Grimaldi et al., 2014). A substantial decline in B-cell counts in sepsis patients was reported, secondary to T lymphocyte deficits and increased apoptosis (Venet et al., 2010). Loss of NK cells directly impacted the immune reaction of sepsis patients (Inoue et al., 2010). Furthermore, the decrease of IFN-Î³ level owing to accelerated apoptosis of NK cells might increase the possibility of secondary infection in sepsis patients (Wesselkamper et al., 2008). Our research also found that most key genes positively correlated with neutrophils and endothelial cells, and negatively correlated with T cells, CD 8 cells, and NK cells. These findings further supported the potential role of biomarkers and provided new insights for immunotherapeutic targets.Our research has certain limitations. Firstly, the two databases contain not only adults with sepsis and healthy controls but also children, which may affect biased interpretation of the results. Secondly, we need apply larger clinical samples (adults and children) to verify the expression levels of nine key molecules identified. Further research should explore whether these key genes are associated with the prognosis of sepsis"

In addition, we screened nine key genes that might be helpful in diagnosing and monitoring the development of sepsis. These key genes showed an inextricable link with the immunological microenvironment in sepsis. This research provides novel insight into latent molecular targets for combating sepsis and promotes a full understanding of the potential immune mechanisms involved in sepsis.Data availability statementThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
