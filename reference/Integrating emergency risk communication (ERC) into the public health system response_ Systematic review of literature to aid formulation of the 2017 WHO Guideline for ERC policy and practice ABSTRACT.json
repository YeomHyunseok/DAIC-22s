The goal of this review was to integrate ERC best practices into governmental and non-governmental health systems for all emergencies of public health concern, by addressing three questions: (1) to identify best practices for the integration of ERC into national and international public health preparedness; (2) to identify mechanisms to establish effective intra-agency, inter-agency, and/or cross-jurisdictional information sharing; and (3) to identify methods to coordinate risk communication activities between responding agencies across organizations and levels of response. The review covered scientific and grey literature publications between January 2003 and February 2016, and searches were conducted in 17 English language electronic libraries besides Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish language databases. A mixed deductive-inductive process was used to synthesize findings across studies through identifying thematic areas. While 8,215 articles were initially retrieved, after a sequential screening process, the final evidence syntheses comprised of 21 articles for question (1) and 24 for questions (2) and (3) combined (due to overlap of themes). Theconfidence in findingswas assessed by the Qualitative Evidence Syntheses (GRADE-CERQual) tool. PRISMA guidelines were followed to the extent possible given the limitations inherent to a review largely based on qualitative studies. The identified literature was very context-specific and referred to mechanisms, practices from the field, and recommendations that were derived from planning or response efforts implemented at the national or local levels in specific countries. Integration of ERC functions into public health emergency preparedness, planning and response activities was influenced by reforming components of the leadership structure when needed, modifying organizational factors, and nullifying restrictions (including amending laws/ regulations) that might have been an obstacle to the timely release of information. Exercises and trainings were recognized as effective strategies to identify the barriers and successes in this process of integration. Key elements to enhance information sharing and coordination across organizations included the creation of networks, task-forces and committees across disciplines, organizations and geographic areas. Engagement of local stakeholders was also important to guarantee the flow of information up and down the incident command system. On the whole, few empirical studies, especially from low- and middle-income countries, related to the WHO research"

To facilitate an accurate identification of the gaps, the authors suggest integrating current findings with case studies across the WHO regions to better understand the specific evidence that is needed in practice across the multitude of ERC functions. BODY: IntroductionEmergency risk communications (ERC) consist of \"the real-time exchange of information,advice and opinions\" between decision-makers, experts and the general public. [1] Over the last decade, nations have increasingly faced challenges in acquiring, processing and communicating information to protect the physical, social and economic wellbeing of their citizens during emergency situations. This challenge is in part due to the lack of evidence on how to best communicate among responding agencies and with the public. [2]ERC is one of the eight core functions that World Health Organization (WHO) member states are required to fulfill as part of the International Health Regulations (IHR) [3]. All types of public health emergencies, ranging from infectious diseases outbreaks and pandemics to weather related events and manmade disasters, present national leaders with the challenge of communicating risk to the affected populations while maintaining trust, transparency and consistency of messages. While there are existing best practices and training in the field of ERC, there are few comprehensive, evidence-based, systems-focused principles and guidelines to support its practice. In response to this need, and recognizing that access to information is a fundamental right of an affected population, the WHO established a Guideline Development Group (GDG) in 2015 to steer the development of guidance on ERC for its member states. [4] This guideline has been recently published by the WHO, and provides advice and direction on how member states can integrate the best practices of risk communication into critical governmental and non-governmental health systems for all emergencies of public health concern (natural/man-made disasters, infectious disease epidemics/pandemics, and terrorism). [5]The WHO commissioned the Emergency Preparedness, Research, Evaluation and Practice (EPREP) program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to conduct a systematic review of literature to facilitate evidence syntheses for the development of ERC guidelines for its member states (the full report has been made available by the WHO). [6] The goal of this review was to integrate ERC best practices into governmental and non-governmental health systems for all emergencies of public health concern, by addressing three questions: (1) to identify best practices for the integration of ERC into national and international public health preparedness; (2) to identify mechanisms to establish effective intra-agency, inter-agency, and/or cross-jurisdictional (such as cross-border; national with sub-national jurisdictions,"

    "full_text": "national with sub-national jurisdictions, etc.) information sharing; and (3) to identify methods to coordinate risk communication activities between responding agencies across organizations and levels of response. It was envisaged that answering these questions would facilitate the integration of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of ERC practices and structures into the WHO guideline development process.Recognizing that the evidence answering these questions was more likely to be qualitative or mixed-methods research, the WHO developed the \"Setting, Perspective, phenomenon of Interest, Comparison, Evaluation of impact\" (SPICE) format to facilitate the interpretation of these questions and guide development of search terminology. The detailed breakdown of the SPICE format for each question is provided in the published WHO Guideline. [5]MethodsEvidence acquisitionThe review was primarily conducted for all scientific and grey literature in English, Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish language databases, between January 1, 2003 and February 7–9, 2016 (specific dates mentioned with the list of databases in Tables1–3).

The web pages of a number of governmental and non-governmental public health agencies from French, Spanish, and Portuguese speaking countries, as well as Italy (as the major Italian-speaking nation) were screened. The research team also communicated with several risk communication experts and academics across USA, Europe (England, Germany, Switzerland, members of European CDC), Asia (India, China, Japan, Bangladesh, Vietnam), Latin America (Portugal, Argentina) and the Middle East (Qatar) to substantiate the understanding of systemic gaps and political-cultural sensibilities in ERC, as"

No articles published in Arabic, French or Russian languages were identified, though it was possible that the English language abstract of such an article was included among those retrieved from the global databases. The detailed search strategies for English, Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish language databases are provided in Tables1–3.In the title review phase, the authors specifically screened for articles including the terms \"communication\" or related words (risk/ crisis communication) along with an event of interest like any natural or man-made disaster, any infectious disease outbreak or epidemic or pandemic, or any event of terrorism (or simulation studies on these scenarios). Articles were also included if the terms \"risk management,” \"preparedness,\" \"preparedness exercise,\" or “knowledge” were mentioned in the title. In the next phase, the researchers evaluated 1899 abstracts to include only: (i) research based on an empirical study [results/recommendations based on some observation or experiment]; and (ii) research directly or indirectly providing information to address at least one of the three WHO questions. This screening ensured that only articles which clearly violated the above criteria were excluded. Subsequently, 880 full-text articles were reviewed to determine eligibility for inclusion based on the assessment that they addressed components of the WHO SPICE breakdown, the details of which can be found in the published WHO Guidelines (Annex 3: SPICE questions #1, 2 and 6). [5]To determine if the research was addressing the WHO questions, two reviewers independently read the article (with the exception of articles in Chinese language), and based on the SPICE breakdown identified sentences (in the article) supported by empirical data that would provide information which directly answered a WHO question or was related to the question (indirectly answered the question). Subsequently the two reviewers met to discuss their judgment, and in case of disagreement a third reviewer was consulted. Furthermore all articles deemed to be indirectly related were discussed with the WHO team to make sure the information was related to the questions developed by WHO.Categorization of articlesStudy title, first author, year of publication, type of publication (i.e. journal article, organizational report etc.), country/ region of the study, study design (i.e. qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods or case study, with subtypes as applicable), population/sample studied or addressed (i.e."

The objectives of each study were noted, and the key topic area and principal findings and/or recommendations were carefully described. The relevance of an article to one or more of the WHO questions under consideration was critically judged and differences in opinion were resolved through consultations (as described earlier).An article was defined to be \"directly relevant\" to a specific WHO question if: (1) it had an empirical study design, and (2) the findings and/or recommendations directly answered that particular WHO question. If an article did not satisfy both these criteria, it was coded as \"indirectly relevant\" and not included in the final evidence synthesis.Methods of evidence synthesisFour methodological streams were identified to classify and characterize the selected articles: 1) quantitative (randomized group comparison, non-randomized group comparison and descriptive surveys), 2) qualitative (interviews, focus groups and textual/content analysis), 3) mixed-methods (use of both quantitative and qualitative techniques) and 4) case studies (description of the response to a particular emergency/crisis situation). The literature was then synthesized using the Best Fit Framework Synthesis described by Booth et al. [7] and Barnett-Page [8], which involves searching for existing theories/conceptual frameworks and creating a composite framework describing findings within each theme/concept. A mixed deductive-inductive process was used to synthesize findings across studies, starting with the SPICE components for each WHO question to develop the themes, and subsequently adding more thematic areas based on the literature.For question 1, the syntheses of evidence is presented separately for English (n = 6) and Chinese language (n = 15) publications because of the different types of studies included in the two languages and difficulties in merging concepts and themes between the two. However, integration of the themes in a unified synthesis among articles in the two aforementioned languages was possible for questions 2 and 3, and therefore the evidence syntheses for these two questions (all language publications) have been presented together.Quality assessment of the evidenceA number of tools were applied to assess the quality of each study based on the methodology and study design: the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tools were used to assess cohort studies and qualitative studies (including content analysis) [9], the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for studies using mixed methods [10], the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized interventional studies [11], the AMSTAR evaluation for systematic reviews [12], and the critical appraisal checklist for"

Subsequently,confidence in findingswas assessed by the use of the Qualitative Evidence Syntheses (GRADE-CERQual) tool, and a level of confidence was assigned to each study (high/ moderate/ low/ very low) based on methodological limitations, relevance, coherence and adequacy of data [14]. The GRADE-CERQual assessment was completed both for individual articles (S1–S3Tables) and for the syntheses of findings derived from multiple articles within each WHO question (Tables4–6). GRADE principles were adapted for application to descriptive quantitative studies and GRADE CERQual principles were applied to mixed-method studies. Neither adaptation has been approved by the tool originators.

As reported by Yen et al (2009), following the SARS outbreak, the Taipei City Government initiated a new public health plan using an integrated infection control system against emerging infectious diseases (EID). This new system integrated early detection of outbreaks (particularly in hospitals and schools), epidemiological investigation, and epidemiologically based public health prevention and control policies. The renovated Division of Disease Control and Prevention (Taipei’s CDC) also became the core operational unit for implementing crisis management procedures and facilitating policy. These systematic upgrades allowed Taipei’s CDC to quickly implement its Multi-Channel Mass Risk Communication Program during the 2007 outbreak of Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis. As reported by Hanvoravongchai et al (2010) the integration of national leadership into public health emergency preparedness planning and response activities in response to pandemic influenza can be seen through the participation of presidents or prime ministers on pandemic preparedness committees. In well-established health systems, pandemic preparedness is integrated within existing mechanisms, notably within the national disaster preparedness framework. In countries with a weak healthcare system, vertical programs are established to manage and coordinate pandemic preparedness and response.Yen (2009)Hanvoravongchai (2010)Moderate(Evidence from both studies was individually evaluated to be of moderate confidence level, with minor concerns on methodology and adequacy of data)Organizational Proximity of ERC Practitioners to National Health Leadership"

Cope et al (2014) noted that a prominent issue in the People’s Republic of China was the inability of certain departments to release information, a restriction that was noted across departments and throughout the chain of command, from the local level through to the provincial and the national levels. The authors recommend increasing the freedom each department has to release relevant information, which has been reasonably verified, as a way to improve the system. The broader issue regarding restrictions on how information can be released directly ties into concerns about the timely release of information. Chambers et al (2012) described how during pandemic influenza in the UK, the only formal communication channel ‘up the chain of command’ was indirect, run through the regional Health Protection Agency (HPA) (Chambers et al 2012). The failure to allow information from the frontline to feed up the channels to national level decision making presented an issue. The UK relied on the Health Protection Agency, a quasi-independent agency, to lead, coordinate and manage the operational response at the local level—a role for which it was ill-equipped, given that its main mission is to provide disease surveillance and epidemiological advice at the national and local levels.Cope (2014)Chambers (2012)Moderate(Evidence from both studies was individually evaluated to be of moderate confidence level, with minor concerns on methodology and adequacy of data)Development of Laws, Regulations, Policies & Frameworks in Support of ERC EffortsLaws, regulations and frameworks contribute to define the context in which ERC functions and strategies are implemented. In some circumstances amendments may be necessary to facilitate such functions. Yen et al (2009) report on Taipei’s ability to launch a large-scale SMS campaign as a direct result of Taiwan’s Communicable Disease Act (2006). This act allowed government officials to override the people’s right to privacy when responding to epidemic disasters. In this case, the Taipei city government held a contract with Taiwan’s six major mobile phone companies, which committed them to six free public service messages (per year) to be sent to their users, if deemed necessary by the proper authorities. Lam et al (2008) describe an important achievement of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) when, in 2005, they signed a Cooperation Agreement on Response Mechanism for Public Health Emergencies with the Mainland Ministry of Health and Macao Health Bureau. Under this Cooperation Agreement, when a cross-boundary public health emergency occurs, the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao forms a joint emergency response group to facilitate sharing of intelligence and expertise.

Ikeda et al (2011) describe a framework of disaster risk governance presented as an implementation strategy for integrated risk management that incorporates innovative local coping capabilities that reduce disaster vulnerability. The framework is supported by a societal platform of disaster risk information called DRIP, developed in 2006 by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention in Japan as a tool for promoting improved disaster risk governance. DRIP is a societal platform of disaster risk information that works as a clearinghouse, collecting and disseminating scientific expertise on risk information from various disaster prevention organizations, fire brigades, and research institutions.Yen (2009)Lam (2008)Cope (2014)Ikeda (2011)Moderate(Evidence from three studies was individually evaluated to be of moderate confidence level, with minor concerns on methodology (Yen, Cope), adequacy of data (Yen, Ikeda) and coherence (Cope).

For example, after the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) updated their pandemic preparedness plan, they took part in the 2006 APEC Pandemic Response Exercise, which tested communications channels to ensure preparedness across Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies in response to emergencies (Lam et al 2008). Hanvoravongchai et al (2010) describes a number of simulation exercises, mostly tabletop exercises, where officers discuss and manage a hypothetical pandemic situation in a round-table manner. For example, Thailand had at least one table-top exercise at both the central level and in each province. Vietnam has conducted many simulations for AHI preparedness at national, provincial and district levels, as well as at airports and borders. There were also a few regional (multi-country) table-top exercises coordinated by the World Health Organization, and one table-top exercise by the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network (MBDS).

To effectively control online rumors, swift response is needed by releasing official counter-messages and by working with the police to identify and penalize the sources of rumors, and by assessing the effectiveness of these countermeasures by continuing monitoring Weibo. There might be potential for social media surveillance to be incorporated into mainstream disease surveillance and response systems. There has been an ongoing national effort to expand the use of government Weibo across the country and to establish a standardized operation, training and evaluation mechanism for Chinese government’s Weibo use and service performance.Since 2012, People's Public Opinion Monitoring Office and Weibo Data Center have routinely published performance evaluation and best practices on official microblogs (Weibo) of all levels of the Chinese government. Guidelines and regulations on government micro blogging have been developed by central and local governments and service providers (e.g. Government Micro blogging Operation Guidelines] by Sina Corporation, and “Autonomous Region Government Guidelines on Micro blog Use and Management” by XinJing.)

As a direct two-way communication channel between the government and the public, 12320 was considered a trusted channel of communication by the public. It offered health consultation directly to the public, acted as an important emergency risk communications agent and had taken on the role of gathering public reaction data. It has been highly valued by China’s MoH and helped shape the ERC strategies.Due to its ease of access and two-way communication, 12320 played an integral role in ERC and public opinions monitoring during the A (H1N1) pandemic and the recent measles vaccination campaigns. Since then, efforts are being made to integrate 12320 into the existing public health response system and to develop a protocol to monitor future public reactions/opinions during routine public health activities and public health emergencies. 12320 provides services including infectious disease prevention and control, health care consultations and public health legal consultations in China’s provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.Jiang et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2010; Zhang XE et al, 2015Moderate(Limited details on survey items, process, and analysis)10.1371/journal.pone.0205555.t006Table 6Synthesis of findings across methodological streams–Questions 2 & 3 (combined).Thematic area of practiceSynthesis of findingsCitationsCERQual assessment of confidence in evidenceCreation of task forces/committees to enhance ERCThe creation of task forces and committees with key stakeholders has been described as a mechanism for improving or facilitating information sharing between national and sub-national authorities and between agencies.

These include: the importance of existing relationships between responders prior to an incident (Nowell 2015), the role of network teams, as opposed to hierarchical teams, for improved decision making (Schraagen 2010), and the importance of information exchange and distribution between decision-making units (Bharosa 2010).

Such mechanisms were summarized under four themes: (1) placing ERC functions into the national leadership structure [16,17]; (2) creating organizational proximity of ERC practitioners to national response leadership [18,19]; (3) developing laws, regulations, policies, and frameworks in support of ERC [16,18,20,21]; and (4) the use of trainings and exercises as a mechanism for testing the effectiveness of the system [17,20] (cross cutting theme).Restructuring of existing organizational components of agencies engaged in preparedness and response efforts, as well as developing novel intra- and inter-agency coordination frameworks were often needed to achieve integration of ERC functions into the national preparedness/disaster response leadership. Yen et al. [16] described how a new public health policy by the Taipei City Government formed the basis for implementing an integrated infection control system to respond to emerging infectious diseases during the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in 2003. The Taipei Division of Disease Control and Prevention was reformed to function as the nodal unit for implementing crisis management programs and policies, including integration of early outbreak detection through hospital-based and school-based surveillance, prompt epidemiological investigations and preventive responses. These structural reforms allowed the Division to launch a swift response during the 2007 acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis outbreak through its multi-channel, mass risk communication program. In the same context, it was Taiwan's Communicable Disease Act of 2006 which facilitated Taipei's ability to launch large-scale SMS campaigns in 2007, as this Act provided the necessary legal platform to allow government agencies to override people’s right to privacy (government could use cellular service providers to send out six free public service messages per year) when responding to epidemics or disasters.Assessing pandemic influenza preparedness in six Asian countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam), Hanvoravongchai and colleagues [17] observed that in nations with well-functioning health systems, pandemic preparedness was integrated within existing mechanisms such as national disaster preparedness frameworks; while those with weaker systems relied heavily on vertical programs for coordination and response.

Furthermore, the WHO and the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) Network coordinated several regional cross-country exercises.Cope [18] noted that the lack of authority to release information to the public was a critical barrier to ERC throughout the the chain of command in the Chinese public health system. On the other hand, shared public health intelligence between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government, Mainland (China) Ministry of Health and Macao Health Bureau facilitated functioning of joint emergency responses in the event of cross-boundary public health emergencies.

Most of the contributory publications (to each area) were individually judged to have only minor concerns regarding methodology, and/or adequacy of data, and/or coherence; hence these articles individually provided evidence of a \"moderate\" confidence level. The confidence in the pooled evidence is a reflection of such a majority of articles.Chinese language literatureThe articles identified to respond to question (1) described practices across three functional areas: (1) how various government agencies used the micro-blogging platform \"Weibo\" for ERC [22–28]; (2) integration of a national health hotline into the emergency preparedness and management system [27,29,30]; and (3) collaboration between the US and Chinese CDCs to build ERC capacity across the country [31–36].Government agencies in China utilized the social media platform \"Weibo\" (biggest Chinese micro-blogging platform, often referred to as “Chinese Twitter”) for public communication during normal times as well as in public health emergencies (like H1N1, H7N9, terrorist attacks, and the Ya’An earthquake) with the goals of achieving timely, open, two-way communications, monitoring public opinion, controlling rumors, addressing public concerns and improving government services.

This was successfully tested as an important channel of communication during the 2008 formula contamination crisis, 2008 Beijing Olympics, 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic, and the recent measles campaign. [27,29,30] This hotline has helped shape national ERC strategies such as developing protocols to monitor public reactions and opinions through providing a direct, two-way communication between health agencies and the public. and has facilitated public health consultations across China’s provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.Within China's governance framework, these novel approaches had helped integrating ERC as a system response involving multiple agencies and the target (affected) population. Further, the Chinese CDC had been working in close collaboration with its US counterpart to conduct assessment of ERC needs at local public health agencies, through conducting tabletop and functional exercises.

Such mechanisms were summarized under three themes: (1) creation of task forces/committees [37–43] and networks [44,45] to enhance ERC, and their elements of functionality); (2) use of information systems to enhance ERC (tools and platforms) [46–54]; and (3) mechanisms to facilitate local stakeholders’ engagement in ERC [55–60].The formation and functioning of collaborative platforms like task forces, networks and committees had been attributed to facilitate efficient information sharing between national and sub-national authorities, as well as between agencies.

[39,40] Specific roles for Information Managers and/or Public Information Officers at local agencies had been proposed to be improve intra-agency coordination. [41,42]Gresham [44] described the collaborative health information sharing network, Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance, between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. This forum brought together politically divergent states and served as a platform to boost regional health intelligence exchange, capacity development through laboratory and risk communications training, and implementation of innovative communication technology. This partnership greatly assisted cross-border preparedness (including airport and border screening, laboratory testing) and ERC strategies during the H1N1 pandemic, building on pre-existing trust and thoroughly exercised national/regional emergency plans and protocols.

Regional-level coordinated preparedness and prevention efforts led to better control of the pandemic within the participating countries.

Militello [54] had observed that, given the diverse levels of knowledge and experience of different teams at an emergency operations center (EOC), low-cost substitutes like notebooks, whiteboards, and telephone books, in addition to electronic tools, could greatly improve functional efficiency by removing any asymmetric skills barriers.Different mechanisms were proposed to engage local stakeholders in formulating and implementing ERC strategies. Ardalan [55] suggested formation of Village Disaster Taskforces through community participation in Iran, to function as operational units in the early warning mechanism by facilitating spread of ERC to the lowest levels of the chain. Cole et al.

Factors that seemed to be related to the integration of ERC functions in national and international public health emergency preparedness, planning and response activities included renovation of components of the leadership structure when needed, modification of organizational factors, nullifying restrictions that might hinder the timely release of information, and amendments to laws and regulations where feasible. Exercises and trainings were recognized as strategies to identify barriers and successes in the integration of ERC functions into preparedness, planning and response efforts. Key elements to enhance information sharing and coordination across organizations included the creation of networks, task-forces and committees across disciplines, organizations and geographic areas. The functionality of information systems was a key element for the sharing of information by tailoring such systems to the needs of the users. Engagement of local stakeholders was equally important to guarantee the flow of information up and down the incident command system.Despite conducting a very thorough literature review across multiple language databases, the authors felt that more sensitive approaches may be needed to gather useful evidence in a non-Western non-English context, for example, when conducting region-specific case studies.

This utility-driven approach might be useful in offering actionable information to practitioners on the ground in the context of China, but presented a challenge in quality assessment. With the Spanish and Portuguese language publications, there was a general paucity of empirical literature on ERC. Risk communication in emergency preparedness was mainly addressed by the social health, communication and technology, and human sciences fields; very little of this work was produced by researchers or practitioners working in public health. In addition, differences in organizational response structure, especially in Latin America, contributed to this overall finding.On the whole, few empirical studies, especially from low- and middle-income countries were related to the WHO research questions. The authors attempted to circumvent this shortcoming by searching databases in Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish, as well as relaxing the strict definition for empirical literature to include more case studies and to reflect a broader distribution of country experiences and knowledge. However, this observed bias against empirical studies from low- and middle-income countries may be partly due to the limitations of the authors in their ability to assess a broader range of languages. Furthermore, the fact that ERC is still not precisely-defined as a field of research meant that there were challenges in identifying sensitive search terms and keywords that would incorporate the varied disciplines that cover this field. It is probable that in addition to differences in terms across disciplines, terms may also differ across nations, and even among professionals trained in similar disciplines.The authors believe that the lack of empirical studies across the questions solicited by the WHO demonstrates an overall need for research in these areas. However, an accurate identification of research gaps should be achieved by integrating the results of this review with case studies across the WHO regions to better understand what type of evidence is needed in practice across the multitude of ERC functions. Such an approach may ensure that research is produced in the topic areas of greatest need for practice.Supporting informationS1 TableIndividual study findings within methodological streams and evaluation of confidence–Question 1, English language literature.(PDF)Click here for additional data file.S2 TableIndividual study findings within methodological streams and evaluation of confidence–Question 1, Chinese/ Mandarin literature.(PDF)Click here for additional data file.S3 TableIndividual study findings within methodological streams and evaluation of confidence–Questions 2 & 3 (combined).(PDF)Click here for additional data file.S4 TablePRISMA 2009"

Such communication needs to be transparent, timely and based on the best available scientific evidence, in order to ensure the maximal physical, social and economic well-being of citizens.The identified literature referred to mechanisms, practices from the field, and recommendations that were derived from planning or response efforts implemented at the national or local levels in specific countries, but did not provide direct evidence of transferability to other contexts. Factors that seemed to be related to the integration of ERC functions in national and international public health emergency preparedness, planning and response activities included renovation of components of the leadership structure when needed, modification of organizational factors, nullifying restrictions that might hinder the timely release of information, and amendments to laws and regulations where feasible. Exercises and trainings were recognized as strategies to identify barriers and successes"

Key elements to enhance information sharing and coordination across organizations included the creation of networks, task-forces and committees across disciplines, organizations and geographic areas. The functionality of information systems was a key element for the sharing of information by tailoring such systems to the needs of the users. Engagement of local stakeholders was equally important to guarantee the flow of information up and down the incident command system.Despite conducting a very thorough literature review across multiple language databases, the authors felt that more sensitive approaches may be needed to gather useful evidence in a non-Western non-English context, for example, when conducting region-specific case studies. It was observed that the Chinese language articles tended to be succinct in the methodology section and elaborative about policy or program implications, with an emphasis on status report and actions taken or recommendations for future steps. This utility-driven approach might be useful in offering actionable information to practitioners on the ground in the context of China, but presented a challenge in quality assessment. With the Spanish and Portuguese language publications, there was a general paucity of empirical literature on ERC. Risk communication in emergency preparedness was mainly addressed by the social health, communication and technology, and human sciences fields; very little of this work was produced by researchers or practitioners working in public health. In addition, differences in organizational response structure, especially in Latin America, contributed to this overall finding.On the whole, few empirical studies, especially from low- and middle-income countries were related to the WHO research questions. The authors attempted to circumvent this shortcoming by searching databases in Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish, as well as relaxing the strict definition for empirical literature to include more case studies and to reflect a broader distribution of country experiences and knowledge. However, this observed bias against empirical studies from low- and middle-income countries may be partly due to the limitations of the authors in their ability to assess a broader range of languages. Furthermore, the fact that ERC is still not precisely-defined as a field of research meant that there were challenges in identifying sensitive search terms and keywords that would incorporate the varied disciplines that cover this field. It is probable that in addition to differences in terms across disciplines, terms may also differ across nations, and even among professionals trained in similar disciplines.The authors believe that the lack of empirical studies across the questions solicited by the WHO demonstrates an overall need for research in these areas. However, an accurate"

However, an accurate identification of research gaps should be achieved by integrating the results of this review with case studies across the WHO regions to better understand what type of evidence is needed in practice across the multitude of ERC functions. Such an approach may ensure that research is produced in the topic areas of greatest need for practice."
