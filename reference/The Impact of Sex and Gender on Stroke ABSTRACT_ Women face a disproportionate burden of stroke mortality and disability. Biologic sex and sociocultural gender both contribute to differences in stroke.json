    "full_text": "TITLE: The Impact of Sex and Gender on Stroke ABSTRACT: Women face a disproportionate burden of stroke mortality and disability. Biologic sex and sociocultural gender both contribute to differences in stroke risk factors, assessment, treatment and outcomes. There are substantial differences in the strength of association of stroke risk factors as well as female-specific risk factors. Moreover, there are differences in presentation, response to treatment and stroke outcomes in women. This review outlines current knowledge of impact of sex and gender on stroke, as well as delineates research gaps and areas for future inquiry."
