Because time is of the essence, a systematic ap-proach that can be easily reviewed and practiced is most ef-feclive. This process is termed \"initial assessment\" andincludes:\n\n● Preparation● Triage● Primary survey (A BCDEs)● Resuscitation● Adjuncts to primary survey and resuscitation● Consider need for patient transferpa-● Second. Ty survey (head-to-toe evaluation andtient history)● Adjuncts to the secon da ry survey● Continued postres uscitation monitoring andreevaluation● Definitive care\n\nThe primary and secondary surveys should be repeatedfrequently to identify any deterioration in the patient's statusand to determine whether it is necessary to institute any treat-ment when adverse changes are identified.\n\nThe assessment sequence presented in this chapter reflectsalimear, or longitudinal progression of events. In an actual clin-ical siluation, many of these activilies occur in parallel, or si-multaneously. The longitudinal progression of the assessmentprocess allows the doctor an opportunity to mentally reviewthe progress of an acl ual trauma resuscitation.\n\nATLS� principles guide the assessment and resuscita-tion of injured patients. Judgment is required to determinewhich procedures are necessary, because not all patients re-quire all of these procedures.\n\n? How do / prepare for a smoothtransition from the prehospital to thehospital environment?\n\nPreparation for the trauma palient occurs in two diff erentclinical settings. First, during the prehospital phase, all eventsmusl be coordinated with the doctors al the receiving hospi-tal. Second, during the hospital phase, preparations must bemade to rapidly facilitate the Irauma patient's resuscitation.\n\nCoordination with the prehospital agency and personnelcan greatly expedite treatment in the field. The prehospitalsystem should be set up to notify the receiving hospital be-fore personnel transporl the patient from the scene. This al-lows for mobilization of the hospital's trauma teammembers so that all necessary personnel and resources arepresent in the emergency deparlment (ED) al the time ofthe patient's arrival.\n\nDuring the prehospital phase、 emphasis should beplaced on airway maintenance, control of external bleed-ing and shock, immobilization of the patient, and imme-diate transport lo the closest appropri ate facility,preferably a verified Irau ma center. F,very effort should bemade to minimize scene time (see Figure 1-1). Emphasisalso should be placed on obtaining and reporting infor-mation needed for triage at the hospital, (eg, time of in-jury, events related to the injury, and patient hislory). Themechanisms of injury can suggest the degree of injury aswell as specilic injuries for which the patient must be eval-uated.\n\n'I'he National Association of Emergency Medical Tech-nicians' Prehospital Trauma Life Support Committee,in CO-operation with the Commitlee on Trauma (COT) of theAmerican College of Surgeons (ACS), has developed acourse with a format similar to the ATLS Course that ad-dresses prehospital care for injured patien ts.\n\nAdvance planning for the trauma patient's arrival is es-sential. Ideally, a resuscitation area is available for\n\nFigure 1-1 Field Triage Decision Scheme.\n\n4 CHAPTER 1 · Initial Assessment and Management\n\ntrauma patients. Proper airway equipment (eg, laryngo-scopes and tubes) should be organized, tested, andplaced where it is immediately accessible. Warmed in-travenous crystalloid solutions should be available andready to inf use when the patient arrives. Appropriatemonitoring capabilities should be immediately available.A method to summon additional medical assistanceshould be in place, as well as a means to ensure promptresponses by laboratory and radiology personnel. Trans-fer agreements with verified trauma centers should beestablished and operational. See American College ofSurgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS COT), Resourcesfor Optimal Care of the Injured Patient, 2006. Periodic re-view of patient care through the quality improvementprocess is an essential component of each hospital'strauma program.\n\nAll personnel who have contact with the patient mustbe protected from communicable diseases. Most promi-nent among these diseases are hepatitis and the acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other healthagencies strongly recommend the use of standard precau-tions (eg, face mask, eye protection, water-imperviousapron, leggings, and gloves) when coming into contactwith body Iluids. The ACS COT considers these to be min-inum precautions and protection for all health-careproviders. Standard precautions are also an OccupationalSaf ety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirement inthe United States.\n\nTwo types of triage situations usually exist: multiple ca-sualties and mass casualties.\n\n[n multiple-casualty incidents, the number of patients andthe severity of their injuries do not exceed the ability of thefacility to render care. In such situations, patients with life-threatening problems and those sustaining multiple-systeminjuries are treated first. The use of prehospital care proto-cols and online medical direction can facilitate and improvecare initiated in the field. Periodic multidisciplinary reviewof the care provided through quality improvement activi-ties is essential.\n\nIn mass-casualty events, the number of patients and theseverity of their injuries exceed the capability of the facilityand staff. [n such situations, the patients with the greatestchance of survival and requiring the least expenditure oftime, equipment, supplies, and personnel, are treated first.\n\nWhat is a quick, simple way to assessthe patient in 10 seconds?\n\nPatients are assessed, and their treatment priorities areestablished, based on their injuries, vital signs, and the\n\nTriage also pertains to the sorting of patients in thefield and the decision regarding to which medical facil-ity they should be transported. It is the responsibility ofthe prehospital personnel and their medical director toensure that appropriate patients arrive at appropriatehospitals. For example, it is inappropriate for prehospi-tal personnel to deliver a patient who has sustained se-vere trauma to a hospital that is not a trauma center if atrauma center is available at another hospital (see Fig-ure 1- 1). Prehospital trauma scoring is helpful in identi-fying severely injured patients who should betransported to a trauma center. See Appendix 1: TriageScenarios and Appendix: C: Trauma Scores: Revised andPediatric.\n\nTriage involves the sorting of patients based on their needfor treatment and the resources available to provide thattrealment. Treatment is rendered based on the ABC priori-ties (Airway with cervical spine protection, Breathing, andCirculation with hemorrhage control), as outlined later inthis chapter\n\ninjury mechanisms. In severely injured patients, logicaland sequential treatment priorities must be establishedbased on overall palient assessmenl. The patient's vitalfunctions must be assessed quickly and efficien thy. Man-agement consists of a rapid primary survey, resuscitationof vital functions, a more detailed secondary survey, and,finally, the initiation of definitive care. This process con-stitutes the ABCDEs of trauma care and identifies life-threatening conditions by adhering to the followingsequence:\n\n1. Airway maintenance with cervical spine protection2. Breathing and ventilation3. Circulation with hemorrhage control4. Disability: Neurologic status5. Exposure/Environmental control: Completely und ressthe patient, but prevent hypothermia\n\nDuring the primary survey, life-threatening conditionsare identified, and management is instituted simultaneously.The prioritized assessment and management procedures de-scribed in this chapter are presented as sequential steps inorder of importance and for the purpose of clarity. How-ever, these steps are frequently accomplished simultane-ously.\n\nPriorities for the care of pediatric palieuts are the sameas those for adults. Although the quantities of blood, tluids,and medications; size of the child; degree and rapidity ofheat loss; and injury patterns may differ, the assessment andmanagement priorities are identical. 1 Specific issues re-lated to pediatric trauma patients are addressed in Chapter10: Pediatric Trauma.\n\nPriorities for the care of pregnant females are similar tothose for nonpregnant females, but the anatomic and phys-iologic changes of pregnancy may modify the patient's re-sponse to injury. Early recognition of pregnancy bypalpation of the abdomen for a gravid uterus and labora-tory testing (human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG) andearly fetal assessmenl are important for maternal and fetalsurvival. S Specific issues related to pregnant patients areaddressed in Chapter 12: Trauma in Women.\n\nTrauma is a common cause of death in the elderly. Withincreasing age, cardiovascular disease and cancer overtakethe incidence of injury as the leading causes of death. Inter-estingly, the risk of deatb for any given injury at the lowerand moderate Injury Severity Score (ISS) levels is greater forelderly males than for elderly females.\n\nResuscitation of elderly patients warrants special at-tention. The aging process diminishes the physiologic re\"serve of elderly trauma patients, and chronic cardiac,respiratory, and metabolic diseases can reduce the abilityof these patients to respond to injury in the same mannerin which younger patients are able to compensate for the\n\nphysiologic stress caused by injury. Comorbidities such asdiabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease, coagulopa-thy, liver disease, and peripheral vascular disease are morecommon in older patients and adversely affect outcomesfollowing injury. In addition, the long-term use of medica-tions may alter the usual physiologic response to injury, andthe narrow therapeutic window frequently leads to over-re-suscitation or under-resuscitation in this patient popula-tion. As such, early, invasive monitoring is frequently avaluable adjunct to management. Despite these facts, mostelderly trauma patients recover and return to their prein-jury level of independent activity if appropriately treated.Prompt, aggressive resuscitation and the early recognitionof preex isting medical conditions and medication use canimprove survival in this patient group. See Chapter 11:Geriatric Trauma.\n\nAIRWAY MAINTENANCE WITHCERVICAL SPINE PROTECTION\n\nUpon initial evaluation of a trauma patient, the airwayshould be assessed first to ascertain patency. This rapid as-sessment for signs of airway obstruction should include in-spection for foreign bodies and facial, mandibular, ortracheal/laryngeal fractures that may result in airway ob-struclion. Measures to establish a patent airway should beinstiluted while protecling the cervical spine. Initially, thechin-lilt or jaw-t:hrust maneuver is recommended to achieveairway patency.\n\nIf the palient is able to communicate verbally, the air-way is not likely to be in immediate jeopardy; however, re-peated assessment of airway patency is prudent. In addition,patients with severe head injuries who have an altered levelof consciousness or a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of8or less usually require the placement of a definitive airway.The linding of nonpurposeful motor responses stronglysuggests the need for definitive airway management. Man-agement of the airway in pediatric patients requires knowl-edge of the unique anatomic fea tures of the position andsize of the larynx in children, as well as special equipment.See Chapter IO: Pediatric Trauma.\n\nWhile assessing and managing the patient's airway,great care should be taken to prevent excessive movementof the cervical spine. The patient's head and neck should notbe hyperextended, hyperflexed, or rotated to establish andmaintain the airway. Based on a history of a traumatic inci-dent, loss of stability of the cervical spine should be sus-pected. Neurologic examination alone does not exclude adiagnosis of cervical spine injury. Protection of the patient'sspinal cord with appropriate immobilization devices shouldbe accomplished and maintained. Ifimmobilization devicesmust be removed temporarily, one member of the traumateam should manually stabilize the patient's head and neckusing inline immobilization techniques (Figure 1-2).\n\n6 CHAPTER 1 · Initial Assessment and Management\n\nFigure 1-2 If immobilization devices must beremoved temporarily, one member of the traumateam should manually stabilize the patient'shead and neck using inline immobilizationtechniques.\n\nThe stabilization equipment used lo protect the pa-lient's spinal cord should be left in place until cervical spineinju ry has been excluded. Protection of the spine and spinalcord is a critically important management principle. Cervi-cal spine radiographs may be obtained to confirm or ex-clude injury once immediate or potentially life-threateningconditions have been addressed. Assume a cervical spine in-jury in any patient with multisystem trauma, especially thosewith an altered level of consciousness or a blunt injury abovethe clavicle. See Chapter 7: Spine and Spinal CordTrauma.\n\nEvery effort should be made to promptly identify air-way compromise and secure a definitive airway. Equally im-portant is the necessity to recognize the potential forprogressive airway loss. Frequent reevaluation of airway pa-tency is essential to identify and treat pa tients who are los-ing the ability to maintain an adequate airway.\n\nAirway patency alone docs not ensure adequate ventila-tion. Adequate gas exchange is required to maximize oxy-genation and carbon dioxide elimination. Ventilationrequires adequate lunction of the lungs.chest wall, and di-aphragm. Each component must be examined and evalu-ated rapidly.\n\nThe patient's chest should be exposed to adequatelyassess chest wall excursion. and ausculta tion should beperformed to ensure gas flow in the lungs. Visual inspec-tion and palpation can detect injuries to the chest wallthat might compromise ventilati"
