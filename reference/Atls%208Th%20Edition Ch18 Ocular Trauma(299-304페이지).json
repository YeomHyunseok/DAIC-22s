In fact, injuries occur in patterns that are predictableand preventable. The expression \"an accident waiting tohappen\" is both paradoxical and premonitory. There arehigh-risk individuals and high-risk environments. In com-bination, they provide a chain of events that can result intrauma. With the changing perspective in today's healthcare from managing illness to promoting wellness, injuryprevention moves beyond promoting good health to takeon the added dimension of reducing health care costs.\n\nPrevention is timely. Doctors who care for injured in-dividuals have a unique opportunity to practice effective,preventive medicine. Although the true risk takers may berecalcitrant about any and all prevention messages, manypeople who are injured through ignorance, carelessness,or temporary loss of self-control may be receptive to in-formation that is likely to reduce their future vulnerability.Each doctor-patient encounter is an opportunity to re-duce trauma recidivism. This is especially true for surgeonswho are involved daily during the period immediately afterinjury, when there may be opportunities to truly changebehavior. The basic concepts of injury prevention andstrategies for implementation through traditional publichealth methods are included in this appendix.\n\nClassification of Injury Prevention\n\nPrevention can be considered as primary, secondary, ortertiary. Primary prevention refers to elimination of thetrauma incident completely. Examples of primary preven-tion measures include stoplights at intersections, windowguards to prevent toddlers from falling, swimming poolfences to keep out nonswimmers and prevent drowning,DU1 laws, and safety caps on medicines to prevent inges-tions.\n\nSecondary prevention accepts the fact that an injurymay occur, but serves to reduce the severity of the injurysustained. Examples of secondary prevention includesafety belts, airbags, motorcycle and bicycle helmets, andplayground safety surfaces.\n\nTertiary prevention involves reducing the conse-quences of the injury after it has occurred. Trauma sys-tems, including the coordination of emergency medical\n\nservices, identification of trauma centers, and the integra-tion of rehabilitation services to reduce impairment, con-stitute efforts at tertiary prevention.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Haddon described a useful approach toprimary and secondary injury preven tion that is nowknown as the Haddon matrix. According to Haddon's con-ceptual framework, there are three principal factors in in-jury occurrence: the injured person (host), the injurymechanism (eg, vehicle, gun), and the environment inwhich the injury occurs. There are also three phases dur-ing which injury and its severity can be modified: the pre-event phase, the event phase (injury), and the post-eventphase. Table A-1 outlines how the matrix serves to iden-tify opportunities for injury prevention and can be ex-trapolated to address other injury causes. The adoption ofthis structured design by the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration resultedin a sustained reduction inthe fatality rate per vehicle mile driven over the past twodecades.\n\nThe Four Es of Injury Prevention\n\nInjury prevention can be directed at human factors (be-ha vioral issues), vectors of injury, and/or environmentalfactors and implemented according to the four Es of in-jury prevention:\n\n● Education● Enforcement● Engineering● Economics (incentives)\n\nEducation is the cornerstone ofinjury prevention. Ed-ucational efforts are relatively simple to implement; theypromote the development of constituencies and serve tobring the issue before the public. Without an informed andactivist public, subsequent legislative efforts (enforcement)are likely to fail. Education is based on the premise that\n\n280 APPENDIX A ● Injury Prevention\n\nTABLE A-1 ■ Haddon's Factor-Phase Matrix for Motor Vehicle Crash PreventionPRE-EVENTEVENTPOST-EVENTHostAvoidance of alcohol useUse of safety beltsCare delivered by bystanderVehicleAntilock brakesDeployment of air bagAssessment of vehicle characteristics that may have contributed to eventEnvironmentSpeed limiImpact-absorbing barriersAccess t trauma system\n\nknowledge supports a change in behavior. Although attrac-tive in theory, education in injury prevention has been dis-appointing in practice. Yet it provides the underpinning forimplementation of subsequent strategi es, such as that to re-duce alcohol-related crash deaths. Mothers Against DrunkDriving is an organization that exemplifies the effective useof a primary education strategy to reduce alcohol-relatedcrash deaths. Through their ef forts, an inf ormed andaroused public facilitated the enactment� of stricter drunk-driving laws, resulting in a decade of reduced alcohol-related vehicle fatalities. For education to work, it must bedirected at the appropriate target group, it must be persist-ent, and it m ust be linked to other approaches.\n\nEnforcement is a useful part of any effective injury-prevention strategy because, regardless of the type oftrauma, there always are individuals who resist the changesneeded to improve outcome even if the improved out-come is their own. Where compliance with injury preven-tion efforts lags, legislation that mandates certain behavioror declares certain behaviors illegal often results in dramaticdifferences. For example, safety belt and helmet laws resultedin measurable i.ncreases in usage when educational pro-grams alone had minimal effecl.\n\nEngineering, often more expensive at first., clearly hasthe greatest long-term benefits. Despite proven effectiveness,engineering advances may require concomitant legislativeand enforcement initia tives, enabling implementation on alarger scale. Adoption of air bags is a recent example of theapplication of advances in technology combined with fea-tures of enforcement. Other advances in highway d"
