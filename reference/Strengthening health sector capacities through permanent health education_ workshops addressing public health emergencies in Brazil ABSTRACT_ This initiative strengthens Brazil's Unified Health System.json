Employing andragogical active methodologies, 156 action plans were developed, addressing preparedness (34.7%), public health surveillance (31.8%), and response (33.5%). Training in small groups fostered situational analyses, collaborative planning, and practical application of theoretical knowledge, creating a scalable and replicable model for nationwide implementation. BODY: 1 IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies have exposed structural gaps in workforce preparedness, underscoring the urgent need for permanent health education programs that move beyond traditional, episodic training. Strengthening the capacity of the health sector is not only crucial for responding to immediate crises but also for building long-term resilience and adaptability.This study introduces an innovative educational model that leverages active learning methodologies to enhance training in preparedness, surveillance, and emergency response. Designed to be both scalable and replicable, this model ensures applicability across different public health settings, promoting continuous workforce development. By aligning with global health priorities—such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the WHO's framework for health emergency preparedness—this initiative contributes to a more responsive, agile, and well-prepared health workforce. The approach aims to embed a culture of continuous learning and preparedness, enabling health professionals to anticipate, respond to, and mitigate public health threats effectively.In the context of Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), the federal level of management launched the “Workshops on Preparedness, Public Health Surveillance, and Response to Public Health Emergencies” initiative. These workshops provide training on emergency management, contingency plans, standard operating procedures, and roles, fostering active participation and collaboration across various sectors (1). Additionally, these workshops involve guided discussions, and the development of practical materials aligned with proposed objectives, enabling longitudinal monitoring of progress and challenges identified.Findings in the literature confirm these results both among participants and at the institutional level. Evidence suggests such educational activities increase knowledge and confidence in emergency management while identifying both strengths and limitations in current protocols (1).The workshops utilized active methodologies and evidence-based practices, ensuring scalability and replicability nationwide.

The goal was to develop competencies for assertive decision-making, allowing facilitators to utilize available resources effectively to address identified needs (2,3). This approach aimed to form autonomous, reflective professionals.The facilitator training plan considered the specific themes for each facilitator per Federative Unit (FU). An action plan was created collaboratively by all participants and facilitators from each FU.Pre- and post-workshop alignments were conducted through briefings and debriefings sessions between managers, organizers, and facilitators. The briefings outlined necessary actions, responsibilities, and timelines, helping facilitators prepare, anticipate challenges, and understand their contributions. These sessions also fostered group cohesion and encouraged collaborative strategy development (4).After each workshop, debriefing sessions played a key role in learning. These sessions were not just reviews of actions, but opportunities to reflect, analyze performance, and identify strengths and areas for improvement. Sharing experiences and providing constructive input during these discussions strengthened team bonds and promoted a culture of continuous improvement, where mistakes were seen as learning opportunities (5,6).2.3 Methodology selectionSmall group work is a core element in implementing active methodologies. This approach facilitates interaction, discussion, and experience exchange, providing a safe and engaging environment for participants, especially during practical activities (7–9). For each session, participants were grouped into subgroups of 8 to 15 members.The four stages of the workshops were designed to address specific needs in managing public health emergencies, including preparedness,"

Participants should also consider other possible situations, including real cases from the territory, thereby expanding the group's perspective.To encourage the exchange of ideas, a brainstorming session will be conducted. All participants are invited to share their thoughts, emphasizing the realities of their local contexts. This activity encourages diverse insights while ensuring alignment with the team's collective experiences.During the discussion, previously selected questions should be introduced both directly and indirectly, following the logical order of the work processes: preparedness, surveillance, and response. Participants should be encouraged to document their conclusions and reflections— either by taking notes on paper or using electronic devices—in addition to the rapporteur's role. The accumulation of these records will aid in crafting a well-organized action plan.The facilitator must ensure the discussion stays focused on the objectives, steering clear of topic deviations. The facilitator should remain attentive to any clarification needs, providing necessary support, as participants are in the process of integrating new concepts (10).Additional recommendations for the methodology include:Create an inclusive environment where all members feel encouraged to actively participate, ensuring they feel safe to share their ideas.Prioritize collaboration and alignment with local realities, which are crucial for successful discussions.Remind participants of the objectives before the discussion to maintain focus and ensure the work aligns with the intended goals.Provide equal opportunities for participation, ensuring all voices are heard.Acknowledge and value individual contributions, recognizing diverse perspectives presented by the group.Summarize key points periodically to consolidate progress and ensure participants are engaged with the ongoing discussion.The facilitators must maintain neutrality, avoiding any personal influence on the direction of the discussions. Their role is to foster a collaborative and participatory environment, where all team members are encouraged to contribute constructively.Additionally, it is vital that participants relate the discussions to the specific realities of their state or municipality. The facilitators should encourage contributions grounded in these local contexts, integrating them into the discussion to enrich the dialogue and ensure the proposed solutions are practical and applicable.3.4 Stage 2: identification of strengths and critical pointsThe aim of this stage is to assist participants in identifying strengths and critical points within each work process to develop the action plan.

If necessary, the spokesperson can be assigned to expedite the process by recording the strengths and critical points.During this stage, classic group dynamic techniques, such as those used in design thinking, can be employed (11):Brainstorming: This technique is used to identify the main ideas of the team. The facilitator poses a trigger question, and participants succinctly and objectively verbalize their ideas. The facilitator should list the ideas on a board or flipchart.Brainwriting: Similar to brainstorming, this technique captures participants' ideas in writing. The facilitator poses a trigger question, and participants write their ideas on sticky notes succinctly and objectively. The facilitator then organizes the notes on a board or flipchart, identifying the main ideas and those that answer the trigger question.Additionally, the facilitator should ensure that participants understand the importance of identifying both strengths and critical points, as both are essential for developing an effective action plan.3.5 Stage 3: collaborative construction of action plansThe objective of this stage is to engage participants in developing specific action plans for preparedness, public health surveillance, and response to public health emergencies, building upon the points discussed in the previous stages. The team's and the rapporteur's records are crucial for recalling key aspects necessary for the action plan.The following procedures are recommended to guide this stage:Presentation of the pre-established model: The facilitator should introduce the pre-established action plan model briefly, highlighting its structure and purpose. This step ensures participants understand how to organize their ideas effectively.Development of the action plan: Participants should collaborate to define tasks, assign responsibilities, set deadlines, and prioritize actions. The facilitator plays a central role in maintaining focus and promoting equitable participation.Recording key elements: The rapporteur should consolidate the contributions into a structured format, ensuring that all perspectives are adequately captured. This includes specifying tasks, responsibilities, deadlines, and prioritization criteria.Presentation preparation: The group should outline a concise presentation of the action plan, emphasizing key strengths, critical points, and priority actions. The presentation should be aligned with the objectives of the work processes and structured using a simple, predefined template.During this stage, it is essential to maintain a clear focus on the objectives and foster a collaborative environment.

Permanent health education workshops play a crucial role in addressing these gaps by incorporating active learning methodologies that foster problem-solving, teamwork, and decision-making in crisis scenarios.While the study does not evaluate the effectiveness of the training in enhancing practical skills, it identifies key challenges in implementation, such as the need for stronger intersectoral coordination, institutional commitment, and resource allocation for long-term capacity-building efforts. Additionally, regional disparities in preparedness levels emphasize the importance of adapting workshop content to local realities to maximize impact.From a long-term perspective, structured training models like the one presented in this study can contribute to greater institutional resilience by embedding emergency preparedness into continuous professional development programs. Ensuring sustainability and scalability requires integrating these workshops into national and regional health education policies, alongside mechanisms for continuous monitoring and refinement.In high-income countries, public health emergency training often benefits from advanced technological resources and simulation-based learning. However, in resource-limited settings, scalable and adaptable training models are essential to overcome logistical and infrastructural constraints. This study bridges this gap by proposing a methodology applicable to diverse institutional and regional contexts, ensuring accessibility without compromising quality.By documenting the structured implementation of this model across Brazil's Federative Units, the study provides insights that can inform the development of similar training initiatives in other regions facing challenges in health workforce preparedness. The findings suggest that active learning-based approaches can enhance capacity building in emergency response, making this model a valuable contribution to global health education strategies.Active learning methodologies, commonly used in health professional training, are less frequently applied in professional development settings.

Despite challenges in shifting academic environments, researchers and working groups have proposed strategies to address these barriers, such as competency-based education, interactive learning methods, curriculum restructuring, and authentic assessment tied to real-world outcomes (8,13,14).In this study, the integration of situational analysis and small-group discussions fostered an immersive learning environment. Participants engaged in real-world problem-solving, applying theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, which deepened their understanding of key principles. Facilitator training further ensured the effective implementation of the methodology.Active methodologies also offer additional benefits, such as fostering teamwork, enhancing communication, and strengthening collaboration skills (9,15). The opportunity for professionals to interact and solve challenges collectively was identified as a key advantage, preparing them for coordinated emergency responses. Moreover, promoting workshops with diverse participants—representing various roles and competencies in public health emergency management—enhanced recognition of different responsibilities and improved coordination capacity through practical collaboration exercises (1).Nevertheless, the successful implementation of active methodologies depends on adequate resources, institutional support, and professionals with both theoretical and practical expertise in these pedagogical approaches. Time, space, and institutional support are essential to ensuring these teaching methods' effectiveness.An analysis of workshops on preparedness, public health surveillance, and response to public health emergencies revealed key strengths and challenges. A major strength was participants' adherence to the methodology and completion of activities within the designated timeframe, largely due to facilitators' expertise in moderating discussions. Additionally, the heterogeneity of group members—spanning different roles, sectors, and competencies—enriched debates, fostering a comprehensive analysis of the challenges presented.Workshop recommendations emphasized fostering intersectoral collaboration, implementing robust risk assessment methodologies, strengthening health surveillance systems, and planning preparedness actions. Federal-level support was deemed essential to enhance sectoral integration, disseminate surveillance initiatives, and encourage greater participation in emergency management. Given the lower participation rates of professionals from municipalities and regional health departments, a key suggestion was to decentralize workshops, implementing the methodology at regional levels and encouraging state health departments to lead these efforts.The discussions provided a holistic perspective on the challenges and opportunities emergency preparedness and response.
