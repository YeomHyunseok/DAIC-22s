Mounting evidence has demonstrated improved survival with the incorporation of dedicatedCICUproviders with expertise in critical care medicine (CCM). This is the first study to systematically survey dual certified physicians in order to assess the relevance ofCCMtraining to contemporaryCICUcare.Methods and ResultsUtilizing American Board of Internal Medicine data through 2014, 397 eligible physicians had obtained initial certification in both cardiovascular disease andCCM. A survey to delineate the role of critical care training in theCICUwas provided to these physicians. Among those surveyed, 120 physicians (30%) responded. Dual certified physicians reported frequent use of theirCCMskills in theCICU, highlighting ventilator management, multiorgan dysfunction management, end‐of‐life care, and airway management. The majority (85%) cited these skills as the reasonCCMtraining should be prioritized by futureCICUproviders. Few (17%) agreed that general cardiology fellowship alone is currently sufficient to care for patients in the modernCICU. Furthermore, there was a consensus that there is an unmet need for cardiologists trained inCCM(70%) and thatCICUs should adopt a level system similar to trauma centers (61%).ConclusionsCiting specific skills acquired duringCCMtraining, dual certified critical care cardiologists reported that their additional critical care experience was necessary in their practice to effectively deliver care in the modernCICU. BODY: Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?This is the first study to systematically survey known dual certified physicians in both cardiovascular disease and critical care medicine.Dual certified physicians outlined which critical care skills were most relevant to cardiovascular intensive care unit patient care, including ventilator management, multiorgan dysfunction management, and end‐of‐life care.Dual certified physicians agreed that general cardiology fellowship alone is currently insufficient to practice effectively in the modern cardiovascular intensive care units.What Are the Clinical Implications?This study has important implications regarding training guidelines and standards for future cardiovascular intensive care unit providers.Forthcoming iterations of training guidelines should incorporate the specific skills that dual certified physicians have identified as relevant to cardiovascular intensive care unit care.Many of the highlighted areas are not currently adequately covered in general cardiology fellowships and will be important educational milestones to include in all future critical care cardiology"

The American Heart Association released a scientific statement in 2012 detailing the need for CICUs with dedicated critical care cardiologists as well as potential shifts in training strategies for aspiring CICU physicians.1The American Heart Association statement outlines the existing Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education training paradigm, which includes 4 years of fellowship with a minimum of 30 months of clinical training, 6 of which must be dedicated to critical care medicine (CCM). The American College of Cardiology Core Cardiovascular Training Statement Task Force has also recognized the need for advanced training opportunities, describing 3 levels of critical care cardiology proficiency.2The Task Force specifies that level I should be obtained during a general cardiology fellowship and should be sufficient to care for the majority of CICU patients. Level II can be achieved with an extra 3 to 6 months of critical care time and level III with an extra 12 months of critical care time. The Task Force only highlights endotracheal intubation and intra‐aortic balloon pump placement as patient care milestones and no evaluation processes are specified, indicating that competencies for the practice of advanced critical care cardiology need to be further delineated.There have been numerous publications, aiming to characterize the added value of critical care cardiology training. CICU providers are exposed to an increasing amount of noncardiac pathology, including sepsis, renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.3,4,5,6,7,8Moreover, patients with these noncardiac complications have longer CICU lengths of stay and a higher risk of mortality.6Transitioning to a high‐intensity staffing model, which incorporates dedicated critical care cardiologists or regular consultation with CICU‐based noncardiology critical care physicians may be associated with reduced mortality, length of stay, and costs.9,10However, dual trained critical care cardiologists remain few in number, with a recent survey identifying only 8.7% of hospitals utilizing them as unit leaders and only 14.7% of hospitals with at least 1 critical care cardiology attending.11Similarly, an investigation of the Doximity physician database reported that only 0.47% of CICU admissions were treated by dual certified physicians and that only 3.4% of the identified dual certified physicians were female.12Despite these data, the perceived priority of fostering critical care trained cardiologists remains a topic of debate, prompting numerous letters and editorials.13,14,15Though numerous studies have described the current"

These cardiologists have unique insight into the importance of additional critical care training and its relevance to CICU patient care in their practice. Current critical care cardiologists, both CCM fellowship trained and practice pathway certified, described using the skills that they obtained by critical care training regularly, albeit the fellowship trained physicians had a higher proportion using those skills on a regular basis. Furthermore, they highlighted the specific CCM skills that are most fundamental to patient care in contemporary CICUs. Greater than 40% of responders selected ventilator management, multisystem organ failure management, airway management, and end‐of‐life care—topics that are not adequately emphasized in general cardiology fellowships.The applicability of these CCM skills to CICU daily workflow is a potential driver of the improved patient outcomes that have been observed in recent studies.9,10The most intriguing study, by Na et al,9described patient outcomes before and after the CICU was converted to a comanaged unit with the primary providers being critical care cardiologists. There was an absolute decrease in mortality of nearly 5% between the 2 time periods with an adjusted odds"

  {
    "full_text": "between the 2 time periods with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.43 (P<0.001). With the increasing complexity of CICU patients, it is possible that the majority of this benefit was derived from expertise in management of noncardiac complications as well as management of difficult cardiac cases requiring a combination of mechanical ventilator support, antimicrobial regimens, hemodynamic tailoring, and renal replacement therapies. Additionally, critical care cardiologists highlighted the importance of end‐of‐life care. Improved provider comfort with end‐of‐life care may foster timely goals‐of‐care discussions, which are associated with appropriate implementation of care limitations and withdrawal of life‐sustaining therapies as well as lower healthcare costs.18,19These multiple areas are not sufficiently emphasized in general cardiology fellowships, and the majority of survey respondents agreed that a general cardiology fellowship alone is insufficient to manage patients effectively in the CICU.Looking forward, as the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and corresponding international organizations move to set requirements for critical care cardiology training, it will be crucial to ensure that clinical competencies in a range of CCM skills are emphasized.1,2,20For example, the document published by the Core Cardiovascular Training Statement Task Force only designated intra‐aortic balloon pump placement and endotracheal intubation as level III patient care milestones.2The skills outlined in this article may serve as a guide for proficiency standards in future iterations. This survey also provides additional experiential support for a CICU organizational shift to a collaborative, multidisciplinary care team structure, especially in hospitals with level I– and level II–type CICUs.1Although previously described as “closed” units, we believe this term to be imprecise and prefer the term collaboratively managed multidisciplinary units to more accurately reflect the situation in which there is a dedicated CICU attending trained in critical care who manages patients with input from the patient's primary, longitudinal provider.Although not the primary intent of the survey, this study identified that only 3.3% of dual certified critical care cardiologists were women. This finding is in line with a previous investigation, which found that only 3.4% of physicians dual certified in CCM and CVD were female.12Interestingly, this gender gap far exceeds that of cardiology and critical care medicine in general, which only have 14.1% and 26.1% active women physicians, respectively.21A gender disparity of this magnitude is comparable with that of interventional cardiology and should trigger a call for cardiology leaders to better understand why so few women have chosen to pursue these specialties.22The issue is multifactorial, with potential contributors including compensation inequality and under‐representation of women in leadership"

    "full_text": "and under‐representation of women in leadership roles.23,24Improved mentorship for women considering critical care cardiology and ongoing diversity task force implementation will hopefully aide in closing the gender gap.25Study LimitationsThe limitations of this study include its survey‐based design with associated recall bias and a low response rate. The group of providers surveyed represent a highly specialized group with the potential for implicit bias in favor of their own training paradigm. Additionally, the majority of respondents completed their CCM training by the practice pathway, which is no longer an available avenue to CCM certification. Thus, the surveyed population may not accurately represent the attitudes of more recently graduated and future dual trained and certified critical care cardiologists. This is also potentially highlighted by the following dichotomy: The younger, CCM fellowship trained cardiologists reported working at university medical centers more than any other care setting, whereas the majority of practice pathway physicians reported working at nonacademic centers. This indicates that a higher proportion of practice pathway physicians may have transitioned into private practice. Lastly, although certification pathway was accounted for in nonresponse weighting adjustments, comparison between these two training groups was not predefined for stratified sampling.ConclusionBased on the clinical and professional experience of dual certified critical care cardiologists, CCM‐acquired skills are likely a crucial component of patient care in the modern CICU. These areas should be emphasized in the development of integrated critical care cardiology training programs and high‐intensity CICU staffing models. Although formal CCM fellowship training may not be required for all providers, general cardiology fellowship programs should consider new curriculum and pathways to prepare trainees to provide optimal care in the modern CICU. Critical care training has long been standard in medical and surgical ICUs and has recently gained acceptance in neurological ICUs. Critical care cardiology training for the CICU should also be prioritized.Sources of FundingThis research was supported, in part, by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.DisclosuresDr Morrow reports grants to the TIMI Study Group from Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, AstraZeneca, BRAHMS, Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Co, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche Diagnostics, Quark, and Takeda and consultant fees from Abbott Laboratories, Aralez, AstraZeneca, Bayer Pharma, InCardia, Pfizer, and Roche Diagnostics.
