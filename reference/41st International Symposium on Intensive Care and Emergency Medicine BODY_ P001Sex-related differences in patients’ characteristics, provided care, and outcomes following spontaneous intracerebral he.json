This study elucidates whether sex-related differences exist in particular with regard to provided care, while also taking into account the patients’ characteristics and outcomes in patients with ICH admitted to the neurocritical care unit.Methods:This retrospective single center study includes all consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH admitted to the Neurocritical Care Unit in a 10-year period. Patients’ demographics, comorbidities, symptoms at presentation, radiological findings, surgical and non-surgical provided care, and ICU- and 12-month mortality were compared between men and women.Results:A total of 398 patients were included (male = 198 and female = 200). No differences in demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, symptoms at presentation, ICU- and 12-month mortality were observed among men and women. Men received an external ventricular drain (EVD) for hydrocephalus-therapy significantly more often than women did. In the multivariate analysis, EVD insertion was independently associated with male gender (OR 2.82, 95%-CI 1.61–4.95,pvalue < 0.001) irrespective of demographic or radiological features. Functional outcome after ICH as assessed by mRS was more favorable for women (p= 0.044).Conclusions:Sex-related differences in patients with ICH with regard to the surgically provided care exist. We provide evidence that insertion of EVD is associated with male gender disregarding clear reasoning. We suggest that a gender-bias as well as social factors play a significant role in decision-making for the insertion of an EVD.P002Connection between possible and proved predictors of the post-neurosurgical meningitis 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid and lactate in cerebrospinal fluidA Pautova, A Meglei, E Chernevskaya, N BeloborodovaFederal Research and Clinical Center of Intensive Care Medicine and Rehabilitology, Moscow, Russian FederationCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P002Introduction:The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of the bacterial 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (p-HPhLA) was recently shown to be a possible one-parameter criterion for the diagnosis of the post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis (PNBM) with cut-off value of 0.9 µmol/l [1].

Concentration of CSFp-HPhLA was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, CSF lactate level was obtained from medical records of patients. CSFp-HPhLA and lactate were studied in dynamics in some patients (n = 5).Results:p-HPhLA is known to correlate with the serum lactate [3]. Moderate positive statistically significant Spearman’s rank correlation was revealed between CSFp-HPhLA and lactate (r = 0.55,p= 0.01 2-tailed). Some patients were studied in dynamics to illustrate the revealed correlation. Patient 5 had no signs of PNBM; lactate andp-HPhLA were less than cut-off values (Fig.1). Patients 1–4 had signs of PNBM according to specific criterium of positive CSF culture (patients 1 and 3) and non-specific criteria of neutrophilic pleocytosis, high CSF protein and lactate (patients 2 and 4).p-HPhLA was higher than cut-off value in all patients with signs of PNBM, while lactate levels were lower than cut-off values in patients 3–4. Detailed analysis of the patients’ medical records explained the revealed differences.Conclusions:The correlation between CSF lactate andp-HPhLA indicates the diagnostic significance and pathophysiological role ofp-HPhLA in the development of PNBM.ReferencesBeloborodova N et al.

Automated pupillary is now available and provides a precise measure of the Constriction Velocity (CV), latency, dilation velocity, size, percent change, and Neurological Pupil index (NPi) [1,2]. The purpose of this study is to find a correlation between NPi, CV and unfavorable outcome in patients with ischemic stroke.Methods:We included patients with ischemic stroke admitted to NeuroIntensive Care Unit in Modena Hospital from August 2019 to August 2020. We collected NPi and CV in the first 72 h of hospitalization, selecting the worst measurement as significant. We used the Neuroptics NPi-200 pupillometer: NPi values < 3 and CV < 0.8 mm/sec were considered abnormal.

At the discharge from ICU 7 patients had GCS ≤ 8.2 patients had left NPi < 3 and GCS at the discharge ≤ 8; 2 patients had right NPi < 3 and GCS at the discharge ≤ 8; 5 patients had left CV < 0.8 mm/sec and GCS at the discharge ≤ 8; 3 patients had right CV < 0.8 mm/sec and GCS at the discharge ≤ 8. There was no statistically difference between each group.Conclusions:CV and NPi evaluate two different aspects of the PLR; NPi and CV are both unlinked to ischemic stroke outcome at discharge, maybe due to the sample size. Further studies are required to the determine the utility of CV and NPi in the prognostication of ischemic stroke outcome.ReferencesShoyombo et al. Sci Rep 8:6992, 2018Jahns et al.

Traditionally pupillary examination is based on subjective, and inaccurate estimation, nevertheless, in the past years, the use of automated quantitative pupillometry (AQP) has change our way to assess the pupillary function as it allows us to detect subtle changes.Methods:We included all consecutive patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (a-SAH) admitted in our ICU from September 2019-March 2020 (n = 21). We recorded demographics data, clinical characteristics, pupillometry measurements during ICU stay, therapies, complications, neurological outcomes at ICU discharge and 3 months.Results:Of 21 patients (age 60 [31–82] years), 16 were aneurysm of anterior circulation (Fig.1), 9 (42.8%) developed intracerebral hematoma. 81% had endovascular therapy, among these, 28% intra-arterial vasodilators, and 14.2% angioplasty. 57% needed external ventricular drainage, 33% and 28% require osmotic agents and barbiturates respectively. The ICU mortality was 24% (n = 5), the mean GOS at ICU discharge was 3, 62% had unfavorable neurological outcome (UO) at ICU discharge, favorable neurological outcome (FO) improved in 52.3% (n = 11) at 3 months. Regarding AQP, abnormal NPi values was associated with UO at ICU discharge (RR 2.4 [95% IC 3.4 to 1.4],p= 0.0001) and at 3 months (RR 2.1 [95% IC 0.9 to 3.2],p= 0.001).

Ultrasound measures with transcranial Doppler and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) estimation can be made at the bedside [1]. We present preliminary results of a study in healthy volunteers (work team members and students) to find the ONSD average in non-hospitalized patients, which we defined as normal population, with the hypothesis that it will be different from the value reported in other populations [2]. This will be the first study in a healthy Colombian population and the first that measures the ONSD using a standardized technique with the enforcement of the CLOSED protocol and the adjustment with the transverse eyeball diameter (ED) [3,4].Methods:A total of 246 subjects are needed in this Metexploratory observational study with a cross-sectional design to estimate the ONSD average value measured according to the CLOSED protocol, the ratio of ONSD/ED, and determine if it is affected by variables such as sex, age, and comorbidities.Results:Preliminary results of 86 subjects showed an ONSD average around 0.35 cm ± 0.12 cm with extreme data up to 0.55 cm. Ratio of ONSD/ED is around 0.17 cm ± 0.03 cm, including values of 0.31 as reported in other populations [2]. There is no effect of sex or comorbidities in our study. The few cases where we could not apply the CLOSED protocol were excluded from the analysis.Conclusions:The first preliminary analysis showed that the ONSD average seems lower than we thought. Even if there are many patients with an expected value around 0.5 cm, our race-plural population may benefit from establishing a lower cut point to suspect a raised ICP. Nevertheless, this is a preliminary report, and ultimately measures must be done before concluding a cut-off.ReferencesRobba C et al. Echography and Doppler of the Brain. 1ed. 2021Kim DH et al.

TBI is frequently associated with extracranial complications and adversely affects outcome [1]. iVACs causing increased ICU days and duration of MV; uncertain is the impact on survival. The clinical benefit of early aggressive antibiotic treatment has not been demonstrated [2]. There is no indication for antibiotic prophylaxis but vigilant monitoring of the development of iVACs are recommended.Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from patients admitted with diagnosis of polytrauma with TBI, from 1/1/19 to 31/12/19, to the Department Major Trauma AUSL Romagna at the Hospital \"M. Bufalini\" of Cesena. We collected AIS and ISS (criteria of CENTER-TBI[3]), GCS, presence of MV, percutaneous tracheotomy, development of AKI/CRRT, application of empiric/targeted antimicrobial therapy. We defined the incidence of iVACs and assessed the significant association with clinical score and trauma severity. For statistical analysis Independent Student's t test, Mann Whitney's U test and χ2 test were used.Results:During the observation period 264 patients were admitted. 16.6% of patients developed an infectious process; iVAC in 13.8% (the only ones that have allowed statistical inferential analysis [4]), peritonitis in 1.13% and skin and soft tissue infections in 1.51%. GCS value and AIS head/ISS were lower and higher, respectively, in iVAC group compared to the no-iVAC group; they reached statistically significant differences (Table1). Not the same was observed for AIS thorax between the 2 groups.Conclusions:The severity of head injury, quantified using the value of GCS, head AIS, and ISS, has an association with the development of iVAC.ReferencesRobba C et al.

The primary outcome was occurrence of infusion-related complications such as extravasation, phlebitis, or soft tissue injury. The secondary outcome was the incidence of hyperchloremia (serum chloride > 110 mEq/l) or hypernatremia (serum sodium > 160 mEq/l).Results:Of 514 peripheral administrations of 5% NaCl, 7 (1.4%) were associated with infusion-related complications. Among these, 6 cases resulted in extravasation requiring intervention, and 1 case resulted in a skin tear requiring intervention. None of the complications required surgical intervention. Five of the cases were documented as such that alternative causes of the patients’ symptoms could not be ruled out. Electrolyte abnormalities occurred with 181 (35.2%) administrations, all of which involved hyperchloremia. Among these, hypernatremia also occurred with 5 (2.8%) administrations.Conclusions:Peripheral venous administration of 5% NaCl bolus appears safe, as demonstrated by a low incidence of infusion-related complications in the study population.ReferencesCooper DJ et al.

About 2000 of those are critically ill and have to be treated in the resuscitation area. The protocol was implemented in April 2021. During the following 6 months (04–10/2021) 2 additional patients were recognized by using this protocol. Intensive care support was established in these patients in the ED following patients’ wishes in favor of organ donation. The resulting 2 successful OD contributed to the hospital’s overall 12 OD during the observed time period (17%).Conclusions:ED staff plays a central role in the detection of patients who are at imminent risk to develop brain death. Evaluating patients’ wishes early in the ED and subsequent introduction of intensive care means can relevantly contribute to the number of successful OD and organ transplantations.P009Super-refractory status epilepticus in a neurocritical care unitD Gomes, D Correia, I Moniz, JM RibeiroCentro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Lisboa, PortugalCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P009Introduction:Super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is defined as status epilepticus (SE) that continues or recurs 24 h or more after the onset of anaesthetic therapy. Treatment is based on case reports and expert opinion, and reported outcome is generally ominous. We aimed to analyse the incidence, clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with the diagnosis of SRSE admitted to a neurocritical care unit (NICU).Methods:Retrospective cohort study. Population consisted of all patients admitted to our NICU with a diagnosis of SRSE, from January 2018 to July 2021. Protocoled-based data were retrieved from our electronic data base. Statistical analysis was performed using T-test and Chi-square for comparing variables between deceased and survival patients. Variables who were statistically significant were introduced in a binary logistic regression model to predict mortality.Results:Of all eighty-two patients with a diagnosis of SE, 29 (35%) fulfilled criteria for SRSE. Mean age was 61-year-old, predominantly females (84.6%); mean SAPS II was 48 and mean admission SOFA was 7. The majority had acute symptomatic aetiology (65.5%). NICU mortality was 44.8%, further 20% patients died in hospital after ICU discharge and another 3.4% after hospital discharge, with a cumulative mortality of 69%. 82.8% were treated with at least 2 anaesthetics and 89.7% with at least 4 conventional antiepileptics.

The objective of the study was to investigate PSH severity and therapy approaches in DOC patients.Methods:The study was performed in 54 DOC patients, group 1—1 (CRS-R score from 0 to 5)—16 patients, group 2 (CRS-R score from 6 to 8)—19, group 3 CRS-R score from 9 to 23—19 patients were monitored daily with a bedside monitor of the following parameters: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (Sat O2), axillary and rectal temperature. Degree of vegetative dysregulation was assessed by the modified PSH scale [1].Results:PSH was treated according to the following scheme: mild degree of PSH (1–5 points PSH scale), a combination of a beta-blocker (bisoprolol 5–10 mg per day) with diphenine (100–200 mg per day), moderate PSH degree (6–7 points) —clonidine (0.2–1 mcg / kg / h), benzodiazepines or clonazepam (2–6 mg/day), severe PSH (8 or more points), combination of an opioid analgesic (fentanyl 0.2–1.4 mcg/kg/h) with clonidine (0.3–1 mcg/kg/h). Decrease in the overall score on the PSH scale, Kerdo index approaching zero were used to evaluate the efficacy. PSH in response to TBI is one of the manifestations of a stress reaction, which, sometimes becomes fixed, loses its adaptive qualities and passes into a \"stable pathological state\" and was found in all groups, more severe in group 1 (Fig.1).Conclusions:An important point in the treatment of DOC patients is the timely correction PSH with a differentiated approach depending on its severity.Funding:The reported study was funded by RFBR project number 19–29-01,066.ReferenceBaguley IJ et al.

Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are widely available, inexpensive, and their elevation has been associated with decreased survival in solid tumors [1]. We aimed to describe the behavior of these inflammatory markers in patients scheduled for intracranial tumor resection.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients at least 18 years old undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection between January 2015 and March 2019 were included. We excluded patients if programmed for reintervention, presented sepsis, or had previous corticosteroid use. Demographic and tumor characteristics were recorded, in addition to preoperatory NLR and PLR. Inflammation was defined as NLR > 3 and PLR > 200. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis were used as appropriate.Results:A sample of 322 patients was analyzed, of which 53% had benign tumors and 47% had malignant pathology. Preoperative inflammation defined by NLR was present in 44% of patients, whereas 22% had inflammation according to PLR. Demographic variables did not differ between patients with and without inflammation. Inflammation by NLR was more common in patients with supra and infratentorial tumors, than in patients with pituitary tumors (p= 0.003). NLR > 3 was also associated with preoperative cerebral edema (p= 0.01), hypertension (p= 0.05), heart failure (p= 0.047), and dementia (p= 0.037).

Defibrillation was performed at 10 min and CPR continued with mechanical chest compressions (LUCASTM) and defibrillation every 2 min until 36 min or ROSC. Cerebral oxygenation was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (rSO2) and invasive brain tissue oxygen (PbO2). Cerebral oxygenation was compared between groups with Mann–WhitneyUtests.Results:Twenty-eight pigs were included in the study with 14 cases in each group. With a median time of 15 min, 9 pigs achieved ROSC in the 50% group and 8 pigs in the 100% group (p= 0.699). During non-effective CPR PbO2(p= 0.001) was higher with FiO2100%, but rSO2showed no difference (p= 0.070). During mechanical chest compressions, there was no difference in rSO2(0.085) and PbO2(0.970) between groups. After ROSC the rSO2and PbO2increased significantly in both groups.Conclusions:The use of 100% oxygen during non-effective CPR improves brain oxygenation.ReferenceNelskylä A et al.

The management of cardiac arrest is progressing including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the therapy of post cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). However, the social recovery rate remains low even now. Knowing accurate prognosis of PCAS and good neurological outcome is very important for utilizing limited medical resources. In recent, there are various cardiac arrest prognostic scores using multiple factors. The minimum indicators to know these are desirable to be able to obtain just after coming to hospital.Methods:Blood samples of OHCA patients were corrected immediately after visited to our hospital between September 2016 to May 2019. Biological anti-oxidant potential (BAP) and derivatives-of-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) as oxidative stress indicators were measured with Free carrio Duo™ (Wismerll, Italy), 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), carbonyl protein (CP), and High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were measured with ELISA kit.

We conducted a systematic review to summarize current evidence regarding whether inflammatory marker levels are useful for prognostic assessment and guidance of treatment in the intensive care unit setting.Methods:We conducted a systematic search from PubMed database using search terms (“inflammation” OR “cytokines”) AND “out-of-hospital cardiac arrest”. Afterwards, each inflammatory marker found was combined with “out-of-hospital cardiac arrest” with AND function to find further relevant studies. We included original articles where inflammatory markers were measured from adult OHCA patients, and their prognostic capabilities were assessed regarding mortality, neurological outcome, or severity of organ failure.Results:Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Elevated procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CRP were associated with outcome in 10/11 (independently in 3), 10/11 (independently in 4) and 7/10 (independently in 2) studies, respectively. PCT had strongest association 1 day after OHCA, IL-6 at ICU admission, and CRP at later timepoints. In general, the inflammatory marker association with outcome was stronger in studies with more severely ill patient populations. Spearman r between AUC and poor outcome proportion was 0.82 for PCT (Fig.1) and 0.53 for IL-6. Studies reported conflicting results regarding marker association with organ failure severity. Numerous other inflammatory markers were assessed, mostly in single studies.Conclusions:Inflammatory markers are potentially useful for early risk stratification after OHCA. PCT and IL-6 are the most studied markers and reported to have prognostic value during the first 24 h of ICU stay. Prognostic value of the inflammatory markers is dependent on the case mix.ReferenceAdrie C et al.

Recent studies show that targeted temperature management (TTM) targeting 33 °C as a mean to avoid fever does not improve functional outcome (FO) [1]. We aimed to assess the prevalence of fever among those not treated with TTM and study associations between fever and FO.Methods:A post hoc analysis of patients who were included in the FINNRESUSCI study but not treated with TTM [2]. The FINNRESUSCI study was an observational cohort study including all patients treated in Finnish intensive care units (ICU) following OHCA in 2010–2011. We defined fever as at least one temperature measurement of ≥ 37.8 °C within 72 h of ICU admission [3]. The primary outcome was favourable FO at 12 months defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2.Results:This study included 67,428 temperature measurements from 192 patients of whom 87 (45%) experienced fever. Twelve-month CPC was missing in seven patients and 51(28%) patients had favourable FO at 12 months. Neither time in minutes nor area (minutes times degree over threshold) over 37 °C, 37.5 °C, 38 °C, 38.5 °C, 39 °C, 39.5 °C or 40 °C were significantly different in those with favourable FO compared to those with unfavourable FO within the first 24, 48 or 72 h from ICU admission.

Inclusion criteria were age < 37 gestational weeks at the time of surgery. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The data collected included weight at time of surgery, time of surgery and the need for catecholamine therapy. For statistical analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used.Results:Between 2007 and 2020, a total of 268 preterm infants underwent surgery. The 30-day mortality was 10.5% (27/268; CI95%: 6.7–14.3) with weight at time of surgery (≥ 2000 g: 1.1%; 1999–1000 g: 10.1%; 999–750 g: 18.2%; < 750 g: 30.3%), time of surgery (7:01–15:00: 7.2%; 15:01–22:00: 11.4%; 22:01–7: 00:30.8%) and the need for catecholamine therapy (22.3%) as significant predictors in the multivariate regression analysis. Table1shows an overview of the identified risk factors and the predicted (multivariate regression model) vs. observed mortality (p= 0.27).Conclusions:Perioperative 30-day mortality of preterm infants during non-cardiac surgery is higher than previously thought. The risk calculation from the easily ascertainable factors (i.e. low body weight at the time of surgery, time of the surgical intervention and catecholamine therapy) could be a valuable tool for estimating 30-day perioperative mortality in preterm infants and should be validated in larger populations.Table 1 (abstract P018)Predicted and observed perioperative mortality of preterm infants undergoing non-cardiac surgeryWeight (g)Catecholamine therapyTimePredicted Mortality (%)Observed Mortality (%)≥2.000No7:00-22:000.81.31.000-1.999No7:00-22:005.43.0No22:01-7:0020.716.7Yes7:00-22:0015.122.7Yes22:01-7:0044.950.0750-999No7:00-22:008.513.3No22:01-7:0029.640.0P019Right ventricular pressure monitoring in acute ischemic right ventricular"

Early detection of right ventricular dysfunction may be facilitated by continuous right ventricular monitoring strategies. The objective is to evaluate the relationship between hemodynamic parameters derived from the right ventricular pressure monitoring and the right ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees) in a right ventricular ischemic model.Methods:Acute ischemic right ventricular dysfunction was induced in 10 anesthetized pigs by progressive embolization of microsphere in the right coronary artery. Right ventricular hemodynamic performance was assessed using the Ees from a right ventricular conductance catheter during inferior vena cava occlusion.Results:Acute ischemia resulted in a significant reduction in right ventricular Ees from 0.26 (interquartile range: 0.16 to 0.32) to 0.14 (0.11 to 0.19) mmHg/ml,p< 0.010), cardiac output from 6.3 (5.7 to 7) to 4.5 (3.9 to 5.2) l/min,p= 0.007, mean systemic arterial pressure from 72 (66 to 74) to 51 (46 to 56) mmHg,p< 0.001, and SvO2from 65 (57 to 72) to 41 (35 to 45) %,p< 0.001). Linear mixed-effect model analysis was used for assessing the relationship between Ees and right ventricular pressure derived parameters. The reduction in right ventricular Ees best correlated with a reduction in dP/dtmax and single-beat Ees. Normalizing dP/dtmax by heart rate resulted in an improved surrogate of Ees.Conclusions:Stepwise decreases in right ventricular Ees during acute ischemic right ventricular dysfunction were tracked by dP/dtmax derived from the right ventricular pressure waveform.P020Acute cor pulmonale and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndromeED Valenzuela espinoza1, P Mercado2, R Pairumani3, N Medel4, E Petruska3, D Ugalde4, F Morales3, J Montoya4, D Eisen4, C Araya31Hospital Clínico Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Intensive Care Medicine, Santiago, Chile,2Clínica Alemana de Santiago, Departamento de Paciente Crítico, Santiago, Chile,3Hospital Barros Luco Trudeau, Departamento de Paciente Crítico, Santiago, Chile,4Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile, Departamento de Paciente Crítico, Santiago, ChileCritical Care2022,26(Suppl"

Our aim was to evaluated cardiac function and its association with lung function, hemodynamic compromise and mortality.Methods:Prospective, cross-sectional multicenter study in four university-affiliated hospitals in Chile. All consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS on mechanical ventilation admitted between April and July 2020 were included. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed within the first 24 h of intubation.Results:Consecutive 140 patients on mechanical ventilation with COVID-19 ARDS were included in the study, the mean age was 57 ± 11 years, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 155 [IQR 107–177], cardiac output was 5.1 L/min [IQR 4.5–6.2] and 86% of the patients required norepinephrine. ICU mortality was 29% (40 patients). Fifty-four patients (39%) exhibited right ventricle dilation and 20 of them (37%) exhibited acute cor pulmonale (ACP). Eight of twenty (40%) patients with ACP exhibited pulmonary embolism. Patients with ACP had higher norepinephrine requirement, lower stroke volume, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time and higher lactate levels. In addition, acute cor pulmonale patients presented lower compliance, higher driving pressure and the presence of respiratory acidosis. Left ventricular systolic function was normal or hyperkinetic in most cases and only thirteen patients (9%) exhibited left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < 45%). In the multivariate analysis acute core pulmonale, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and pH were independent predictors of mortality (Table1).Conclusions:Right ventricular dilation is highly prevalent in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS. The presence of acute cor pulmonale is associated with poorer lung function, but only in 40% of patients it was associated to pulmonary embolism. Acute cor pulmonale is an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU.Table 1 (abstract P020)Principal differences among patients with normal right ventricle, right ventricle dilation without acute cor pulmonale (ACP) and ACPAll n = 140Normal RV n = 86RV dilation n = 34ACP n = 20RS compliance, ml/cmH2O33 [26-40]35 [27-40]32 [26-42]28 [20-37]*PCO2, mmHg43 [39-56]43 [39-53]45 [38-57]55 [43-65]*pH7.33 [7.24-7.38]7.33 [7.26-7.38]7.35 [7.24-7.40]7.24 [7.18-7.32]*NE, mcg/kg/min0.05 [0.03-0.14]0.05 [0.03-0.12]0.04 [0.01-0.08]0.20 [0.05-0.30]*LVOT VTI, cm20 [16-24]21 [17-24]18 [16-21] #16 [14-20]*TAPSE, mm20 [18-23]21 [18-23]22 [19-24]16 [13-20]*ICU mortality40 (29%)23 (27%)3 (9%)14 (70%)*P021Right ventricular outflow tract analysis in the critically ill with sepsisE Bowcock1, L Schramko1, B Gerhardy2, S Orde11Nepean Hospital, Intensive Care, Kingswood, Australia,2Nepean Hospital, Respiratory Medicine, Kingswood, AustraliaCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P021Introduction:Right ventricular"

    "full_text": "1):P021Introduction:Right ventricular (RV)-pulmonary circuit interaction is important to consider in sepsis given the propensity for right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). RVD is associated with increased mortality. In PH a pulmonary valve acceleration time (PAT) of < 90 ms and PAT/pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) ratio of < 2 show strong correlation with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of > 3 wood units (WU). Mid-systolic notching predicts worse outcomes in this group. The therapeutic and prognostic significance of altered RVOT flow profiles in sepsis is unknown. Targeted individualised treatment strategies aimed at minimising insult to the pulmonary vasculature and pressure sensitive RV may be of benefit [1]. Analysis of the RVOT flow profile may alert the intensivist to early RVD in sepsis [2].Methods:Single centre, retrospective analysis of a 110 patients with sepsis who had a transthroacic echo (TTE) with RVOT pulsed wave Doppler (PWD) over a 3-year period. Flow profiles were categorised as no notch (NN) versus notched (N). PAT, RVOT velocity time integral and ejection time were measured.Results:PAT was lower in non-survivors (79.2 vs 91.6 ms, p = 0.02) (Fig.1). A lower PAT/PASP ratio was found amongst non-survivors. Receiver operating curve for PAT/ PASP ratio showed an AUC 0.78 for a cut off value of 1.6.Conclusions:RVOT Doppler flow analysis may be useful in identifying pulmonary vascular dysfunction in sepsis.

The aim of this case study was to assess the hemodynamic and oxygenation effects of moderate PEEP elevation in an invasively ventilated patient with ARDS and severe systolic LV dysfunction. We hypothesized that moderate PEEP elevations may improve oxygenation, LV function and oxygen delivery (DO2).Methods:A 72-year-old patient with severe heart failure and severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2: 60) due toLegionellainfection was assessed. The patient was submitted to invasive ventilation (tidal volume of 5.6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and PEEP of 3 cm H2O).

In contrast, right ventricular (RV) function deteriorated as indicated by RV myocardial performance (RV-MPI 0.31 to 0.58).

We aimed to determine whether an increased portal vein flow pulsatility fraction (PVPF) was associated with worse clinical outcome.Methods:We conducted a prospective single-centre observational study in patients of all ages undergoing corrective surgery for TOF. PVPF and other commonly used parameters of RV function were assessed at 6 timepoints: intraoperatively: before and after bypass, postoperatively: days 1,2, at extubation and at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge (timepoints 1–6 respectively). PVPFmax was defined as the maximum PVPF obtained in a patient at any time point. Correlation was tested between PVPFmax and mechanical ventilation duration, prolonged ICU stay and mortality.Results:The study included 54 patients of age 3 [2.7] years (median [IQR]) and mortality was in 3 patients. PVPF measurement was feasible in 92.6% of the examinations. Mean values of PVPF were 34.87 ± 13.53, 47.24 ± 18.66, 49.92 ± 21.72, 43.07 ± 19.14, 40.52 ± 16.86 and 28.9 ± 12.8 at time points 1 to 6 respectively. There was weak correlation of PVPFmax with duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay (r = 0.286, p = 0.036 and r = 0.296,p= 0.030 respectively) and no correlation with mortality. There was a moderate negative correlation of PVPF with RV fractional area change and RV Strain (r = − 0.488,p< 0.001 and r = − 0.457,p< 0.001 respectively) and a strong"

The objective of the study was to determine whether the presence of abnormal portal vein flow pulsatility is associated with a longer duration of invasive life support and adverse post-operative outcomes after cardiac surgery in high-risk patients.Methods:Multicenter cohort study using pulsed-wave Doppler assessments of the portal vein flow before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (T1) and after CPB separation (T2). Abnormal pulsatility was defined as a portal pulsatility fraction (PPF) of ≥ 50% (PPF50). The primary outcome studied was the cumulative time in perioperative organ dysfunction (TPOD) requiring invasive life support during the first 28 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included major post-operative complications.Results:A total of 373 patients were included in the study. PPF50 was present in 22.0% of assessments at T1 and in 24.9% at T2. PPF50 was associated with a longer TPOD(T1: median 27 [IQR, 11–72] versus 19 h [IQR, 8.5–42],p= 0.02; T2: median 27 [IQR, 11–61] versus 20 h [IQR, 8–42],p= 0.006). After adjusting for confounders, only PPF50 at T1 showed significant association with TPOD. The detection of PPF50 at T2 was associated with a higher rate of major post-operative complications (36.4% versus 20.3%, p = 0.006). Moreover,denovoPPF50 at T2 was associated with the highest rate of major post-operative complications (40.5%).Conclusions:The presence of PPF50 in cardiac surgery is associated to have a longer duration of life support therapy and complications after cardiac surgery in high-risk patients.Consent to"

In clinical practice, specific causes of intraoperative hypotension are often neglected. A detailed understanding of underlying hemodynamic alterations would allow treating intraoperative hypotension causally. We sought to use artificial intelligence to identify intraoperative hypotension phenotypes characterized by different underlying hemodynamic alterations in major abdominal surgery patients. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence can identify intraoperative hypotension phenotypes.Methods:We conducted a secondary analysis of intraoperative hemodynamic measurements from a prospective observational study in 100 patients who had major abdominal surgery with general anesthesia including stroke volume index, heart rate, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, and pulse pressure variation measurements. We defined intraoperative hypotension as mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤ 65 mmHg or MAP between 66 and 75 mmHg when the norepinephrine infusion rate exceeded 0.1 µg/kg/min. To identify intraoperative hypotension phenotypes we used an artificial intelligence algorithm—specifically, hierarchical clustering and then applied the algorithm to pairwise Euclidean distances using Ward’s minimum variance method.Results:There were 615 episodes of intraoperative hypotension in 82 patients. Artificial intelligence revealed six as the optimal number of intraoperative hypotension phenotypes. Based on their clinical characteristics, we labeled the phenotypes as (1) myocardial depression, (2) bradycardia, (3) vasodilation with CI increase, (4) vasodilation without CI increase, (5) hypovolemia, and (6) mixed type (Fig.1).Conclusions:Artificial intelligence identified six intraoperative hypotension phenotypes. Considering these phenotypes may allow treating intraoperative hypotension causally with specific therapeutic interventions.Fig. 1 (abstract P026)Boxplots showing the normalized mean and standard deviation of stroke volume index (SVI), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and pulse pressure variation (PPV) for each"

Vasculature response to occlusion perturbations may enable measurement of arterial compliance, peripheral resistance, and beat-to-beat BP calibration [1]. However, in standard practice the cuff is still only used for intermittent, largely inaccurate BP measurements. Strong assumptions are required to explain vascular occlusion mechanisms. Additional research modalities are needed for further development of cuff measurements.Methods:In this study, we employed MRI to provide new insights over the influence of the cuff on arterial pulsations. We performed MRI scans on 10 healthy participants to observe vasculature, tissue, cuff interaction. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants.Results:The images provide insights into several assumptions. Unpredictable cuff folding occurs during inflation; compression of the arm is not isotropic (Fig.1). This effect possibly hinders accurate modulation of arterial transmural pressure. The artery location is subject dependent; oscillations of superficial arteries are likely expressed differently than oscillations of arteries located within subcutaneous fat. Complex tissue compression/displacement occurs under the cuff; arterial volume pulsations might not be equivalent to arm volume pulsations. Artery size is quantified revealing non-linear collapse characteristics and non-uniform collapse across the length of the cuff. No significant changes in arterial properties were detected during two consecutive inflations.Conclusions:These results are useful for improving existing BP measurements and enabling measurement of arterial compliance, peripheral resistance and beat-to-beat BP. The cuff interaction with the vasculature is oversimplified by existing models. MRI is an essential research tool for further development of cuff-based physiological measurements.Acknowledgement:The data collection was registered with MEC-U as nWMO W20.090.ReferenceBogatu"

The cerebral circulation is concerned by the blood flow redistribution during shock and can be assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD). The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of TCD in hemodynamic management during the early phase of septic shock by comparing a personalized TCD-guided hemodynamic goals to the SSC recommendations.Methods:Fifty patients meeting the Sepsis-3 consensus criteria were enrolled and equally randomized into 2 groups. Concerning norepinephrine infusion, we aimed in the standard group to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with negative blood lactate level during 72 h after shock onset. For the TCD-guided group, MAP goals and Norepinephrine infusion rate were determined according to TCD measurements to achieve a pulsatility index (PI) < 1.3. Sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE) was diagnosed using CAM-ICU score > 3 or a GCS deterioration. The main outcome was 28 days mortality.Results:The 2 groups were comparable regarding demographic and initial severity scores. We noticed an increased mortality (p= 0.031), higher incidence of SAE (p< 10−3) and cerebral hypoperfusion (p< 10−3) in the standard group. In TCD-group, TCD measurements were improved with lower PI (p< 10−4). MAP was higher in the TCD-group (p< 10−4) along the study period with no difference in norepinephrine mean infusion rate (p= 0.497). No difference in final SOFA scores, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay and duration of Norepinephrine infusion were recorded.Conclusions:Monitoring of the cerebral perfusion using TCD is useful in personalizing hemodynamic goals during septic shock and thus improves mortality and neurological outcome.P029Norepinephrine dose variation related effects on mean arterial pressure: preliminary results from the NOVAMAP studyF Moretto1, R Shi2, JL Teboul2, A Pavot2, C Lai2, N Fage2, S Ayed2, I Adda2, T Pham2, X Monnet21Université Paris-Saclay, Service de Médecine Intensive-Réanimation, Hôpital de Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France,2Université Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, FranceCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P029Introduction:Responsiveness to norepinephrine dose variation in terms of mean arterial pressure (MAP) change is highly"

Patients with diagnosis of circulatory failure requiring norepinephrine and invasive pressure monitoring were included. To characterize MAP responsiveness, the maximal amplitude of MAP change over the amplitude of norepinephrine dose change (Emax/∆NE) was defined.Results:From January to July 2021, 29 patients presenting 86 episodes of norepinephrine dose change, 55 increases and 31 decreases, were included. The main origin of shock was sepsis in 59 episodes, followed by hypovolemic/hemorrhagic shock in 16 episodes and non-septic vasoplegia in 11 episodes. Septic shock was characterized by lower baseline values of mean (66, 58–86 vs 82, 71–103 mmHg, respectively) and diastolic arterial pressure (50, 44–64 vs 64, 55–78 mmHg, respectively) and a larger amplitude of norepinephrine dose change (0.08, 0.05–0.12 vs 0.04, 0.03–0.06 µg/kg/min, respectively). Emax/∆NE was significantly lower in septic shock (315, 161–590 vs 575, 401–776 vs 446, 336–1119 mmHg/µg/kg/min, respectively,p= 0.03, Fig.1). At multiple logistic regression analysis, preexisting hypertension, body temperature at the episode time and shock etiology were associated with Emax/∆NE (p= 0.002), and body temperature and C-reactive protein influenced Emax/∆NE in septic shock episodes (p= 0.003).Conclusions:Septic shock seems to be characterized by lower vascular reactivity compared to other shock etiologies and pressure responsiveness is not identical to other distributive shocks.Fig. 1 (abstract P029)Emax indexed on norepinephrine dose variation (Emax/∆NE), based on shock etiology.P030Impact of levosimendan use on survival of patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) supportWS Ng, KB Tang, HP ShumPamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Department of Intensive Care, Chai Wan, Hong Kong, SAR ChinaCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P030Introduction:In refractory cardiogenic shock, VA-ECMO may be employed to maintain end organ perfusion.

Monitoring Cardiac Output (CO) trends over the course of treatment may provide insight into cardiac function and may be used to predict patient outcome. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between the change in stroke volume and outcome in critically ill patients.Methods:The Starling Registry study is an observational registry study evaluating trends in CO and SV (Stroke Volume) over time as related to patient outcome (NCT04648293). Patients that exhibited an overall improvement in CO (first CO measurement compared to last CO measurement) were compared to those who did not exhibit improvement.Results:A total of 229 critical care patients received hemodynamic monitoring during their ICU stay across three different hospitals. 48% were female, and the average age was 64 years. 64% of the patients had sepsis, and 17% of patients were positive for COVID. Notably, patients who exhibited an overall improvement in CO exhibited a decrease need for mechanical ventilation (4.8% vs 15%,p= 0.041) and a trend toward a decrease in mortality (16.4%) compared to those who did not improve (28.0%,p= 0.080) (Fig.1).Conclusions:We have previously shown that patients who show an improvement in CO in response to the resuscitation exhibited improved outcome.

CO assessments can be used in critical care to aid definition of shock status and guide resuscitation. Stoke volume (SV) and CO measurements can be obtained via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as can other methods via thermodilution techniques [2, 3]. CO is measured using the product of cross-sectional area (CSA) and VTI: typically using PW VTI at left LVOT.Methods:We performed a single centre, prospective, observational study in a 15-bed intensive care unit in a UK hospital. Patients had simultaneous measurements of cardiac index (CI) by PiCCO, TTE LVOT PW VTI and TTE AV CW VTI.

All patients were divided into groups according to the degree of preoperative heart failure by NYHA classification. For each group the limit values of NT-proBNP were determined. The predictors of AHF were analyzed, and clinical results of patients with non-AHF (n = 44) were evaluated and compared.Results:Inflammatory pathology of the lungs (odds ratio [OR] 3,37;p= 0.003), aortic valve infective endocarditis (OR 2.97;p= 0.003), nosocomial infective endocarditis (OR 2,14;p= 0.049), vancomycin resistance (OR 2,25;p= 0.032), linezolid resistance (OR 2,34;p= 0.026) were risk factors for preoperative AHF in patients with IE. Limit values of NT-proBNP in the preoperative period in patients with IE depending on the class of NYHA: group I (n = 20)—less than 300 pg/ml, group II (n = 24)—351–1500 pg/ml, group III (n = 31)—1501–6500 pg/ml, group IV (n = 25)—more than 6500 pg/ml. Clinical signs of AHF were detected in 11 (35%) patients in group III with an average value of NT-proBNP—3190.4 ± 280.8 pg/ml. In group IV with an average value of NT-proBNP—20,150.3 ± 1961.2 pg/ml—preoperative AHF had 16 (64.0%) patients. The correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the degree of preoperative AHF and hospital mortality: in group III hospital mortality was—2 (6.5%) cases, in group IV—3 (12%) cases (X2= 18.42,p< 0.001).Conclusions:Estimation of the NT-proBNP level allows timely hospitalization and assessment of patients with infective endocarditis, offers adequate preoperative preparation in the intensive care"

Soluble ST2 is one of the most promising laboratory marker of heart failure. It’s already widely used for diagnostic and prognostic goals in adults [1], but it’s not much investigated in children [2]. We suppose serum soluble ST2 is able to become a new cardiac biomarker of cardiac muscle injury, remodeling and fibrosis, and heart failure outcomes stratification in pediatric population.Methods:Research was performed on the base of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Cardiology department of National Medical Research Center for Children’s Health, Moscow. Sera from 44 patients, 20 female and 24 male, in age from 8 months up to 17 years and 11 months (median age 7 years and 2 months old) with confirmed dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were taken. For all patients levels of soluble ST2, pro-BNP were determined and ECHO was performed for ejection fraction (EF) assessing.Results:Both pro-BNP and ST2 showed direct link with severity class of Chronic Heart Failure assessed by NYHA classification. However, moderate negative correlation (r = − 0.61,pvalue = 0.00019) between ST2 and EF was proofed by Pearson’s correlation test, meanwhile there was no strong correlation between pro-BNP plasma level and ECHO results.Conclusions:Significantly higher plasma level of serum soluble ST2 were found in patients with reduced EF (< 55%). In pediatric patients with DCMP and HCMP ST2 plasma level seems could be used as cardiac function marker. For assessing diagnostic value of ST2 in children with cardiac pathology as a marker of patient response to therapy, future investigations should be done.ReferencesVillacorta H et al.

We aimed to analyze factors associated with ICU readmission among patients with VAD.Methods:After Ethics Committee approval, perioperative data of patients who underwent VAD between November 2008 and December 2018 at Baskent University Faculty of Medicine were analyzed retrospectively. The reasons for ICU readmission and association of perioperative factors with mortality were evaluated.Results:Eighty-nine patients underwent VAD implantation. Out of the 89 patients, 76 were male with a mean age of 46.1 ± 16.5 years. After discharge from ICU, 53 (59.6%) patients were readmitted to hospital, and 44 (49.4%) were readmitted to ICU due to complications. The mean time between readmission to ICU after discharge was 221.1 ± 207.5 days. Out of 89 patients, 23.6% of them were readmitted to ICU due to device-related problems, 14% due to bleeding and 11.4% due to infection. At ICU admission the mean APACHE II score was 10.4 ± 8.9, and the SOFA score was 4.2 ± 3.8. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was observed in 14 (31.8%) patients and the mean duration of MV was 4.4 ± 14.5 days. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 25% and 22.7% of them needed renal replacement therapy (RRT). In multivariate regression analysis, need for prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation (PPMV) (OR: 11.439, CI: 1.046–125.096,p= 0.046); need for RRT before VAD implantation (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.001–0.911,p= 0.044) were found to be risk factors for ICU readmission. Need for PPMV was associated with mortality (OR: 4.882, CI: 1.334–17.873,p= 0.017). 30-day survival was 76.4% and 1-year survival was 62%.Conclusions:ICU readmission after VAD implantation occurred almost half of the patients.

The mixed venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide tension difference (PvaCO2) is an easily derived parameter identifying insufficient tissue perfusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of high values of PvaCO2in COVID − 19 patients early after their admission to intensive care unit (ICU). We speculated that high PvaCO2values might be associated with poor outcome in critically ill COVID–19 patients.Methods:This was a retrospective study conducted in two independent centers of Belgium. We included patients treated in the first wave of the national outbreak with available PvaCO2within 3 days of admission and without severe hypercapnia (PCO2> 75 mmHg). The highest value was registered. Normal values were considered ≤ 6 mmHg, moderate elevations 7 − 9 mmHg, and high elevations > 9 mmHg. The primary outcome was ICU discharge alive and secondary outcome mortality at 28 days.Results:Seventy-three patients were included with median age of 60 years (IQR: 52 to 68), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) 26.1 (IQR: 19.8 to 29.5). Fifty-three (76%) patients needed invasive ventilation within 24 h after ICU admission (12 h (IQR: 12 to 24). The worst ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) within 3 days after admission was 151 (IQR: 86 to 243) and PvaCO26 mmHg (IQR: 5 to 9). PvaCO2> 9 mmHg was associated with longer ICU stay (ICU free days: 0 days (0 − 0) vs 1 day (0 − 18),p= 0.02), independently of PaO2/FiO2and SAPS II score (HR: 0.21, 95% − CI: 0.05 − 0.92,p= 0.04) (Fig.1, Panel A), but not to 28 days mortality (HR:1.71, 95% − CI: 0.48 − 5.91,p= 0.41) (Fig.1, Panel B).Conclusions:In COVID-19 patients, high PvaCO2values early after ICU admission are associated with prolonged ICU stay independently of hypoxemia and disease"

Not much is known about how blood sample parameters behave when stored in room temperature or at ice for prolonged time. Here we investigate the viability and clinical usability of blood samples drawn from critical care patients admitted ICU, and examine blood sample stability and dynamics over time.Methods:Abnormal venous gas blood samples drawn from 30 patients admitted to the ICU at Northern Regional Hospital, were included in the study. 20 samples were drawn per patient at time zero. 9 samples were stored on ice and 9 samples at room temperature. Two samples were controls. Samples were turned every 5 min, and parameters (pH, v-PO2, v-PCO2, v-lactate, pH, and base excess) were measured over the course of 180 min. Values were compared using 2-way ANOVA, and sample means compared as non-inferiority tests, with allowable lower limits for sample mean-mean differences.Results:We find that values for pH, PCO2and PO2were within an acceptable margin for clinical decision-making until 162 min after time-zero when stored on ice, and for 72 min after time-zero when stored in room temperature. Additionally pH, PCO2and PO2follow a linear regression model during the initial 180 min for both ice stored and room stored samples, allowing for the conversion to values at time-zero.Conclusions:Blood samples from critical care patients can be used as basis for clinical decision-making until 72 min after they are drawn when stored in room temperature, and until 162 min when stored on ice. These data suggest that there is a window of at least 60 min where blood samples can remain in room temperature before analysis and still be used for clinical decision-making.P042Concordance of oxygen extraction values, arteriovenous oxygen difference and shunt calculated from venous gases and SpO2compared with arteriovenous gasesLA León-Guerrero1, A Mondragon-Cardona1, JD Charry2, A Muñoz-Tovar11Universidad SurColombiana, Critical Medicine and Intensive Care, Neiva, Colombia,2Universidad SurColombiana, Neiva, ColombiaCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P042Introduction:Calculation of perfusion and oxygenation indicators often includes the simultaneous measurement of arterial and venous gases in critically ill patients.

Arterial blood lactate levels are routinely measured in the ICU to estimate disease severity, predict poor outcomes, and monitor therapeutic handlings. A number of studies suggest that simultaneously with lactate, pyruvate should also be measured, since this might augment prognostic ability, and provide a better understanding of the underlying metabolic alterations in ICU patients. Hence, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between lactate levels, the lactate-to-puruvate (LP) ratio, and clinical outcome in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.Methods:Lactate and pyruvate were serially measured during the first 24 h of ICU stay. A group of ICU non-COVID-19 patients was additionally studied. The subgroup of COVID-19 patients presenting with elevated lactate was also analysed in an attempt to assess the contribution of hypoxic and non-hypoxic causes of hyperlactatemia.Results:The majority of COVID-19 patients (82.5%) had normal lactate and LP ratio on ICU admission.

Mortality of especially elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is high and there is still scarcity of definitive predictors. Aim of our study was to assess the prediction value of Body Mass Index (BMI) on mortality of elderly critically ill with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.Methods:Data of patients, older than 70 years, with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to 22-bed mixed ICU, level 3, was analysed retrospectively. We especially focused on BMI and lactate levels at admission.Results:A total of 102 patients (average age 77 ± 5 years) were included. Average length of ICU stay was 11.4 ± 9.2 days. Average BMI was 29.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2and lactate levels 2.9 ± 3.2 mmol/l (Table1). High-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation were at some point used to support 34/102, 36/102 and 69/102 patients respectively. ICU mortality was 51/102 (50.0%).

Metformin has pleomorphic effects that may be beneficial in sepsis, but at present, the impact of metformin exposure in sepsis remains controversial. Metformin might alter lactate metabolism, but little is known about its impact on lactate kinetics. We therefore investigated the impact of preadmission metformin use on lactate kinetics, acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality in sepsis and septic shock.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with sepsis and septic shock admitted to the ICU between January 2013 and September 2020, including 77 users and 390 non-users (subdivided in diabetics, n = 48 and non-diabetics, n = 342). AKI staging was based on the AKIN criteria including urinary output data. Chronic haemodialysis patients were excluded.Results:Groups and subgroups did not differ in severity of illness nor sepsis aetiology. Admission lactate levels were not different, but evolution in lactate over the first 24 h showed a larger decrease in users vs nonusers (median − 53% vs − 36%,p= 0.010). No difference in AKI or need for renal replacement therapy was found. Mortality data showed lower mortality in users vs nonusers in case of septic shock (21.9% (n = 7) vs 42.7% (n = 61) for 90-d mortality,p= 0.029, OR 0.38 [95% CI: 0.15–0.93]) (see Table1), but revealed no significant differences in the general sepsis population.Conclusions:In our data, preadmission metformin use is associated with a significantly larger decrease in lactate after admission in sepsis or septic shock and with reduced mortality in septic shock. This underscores the need for further studies investigating the interplay between metformin, lactate and sepsis, thereby exploring the potential of metformin use in the treatment of sepsis.Table 1 (abstract P046)Survival in patients with septic shock according to metformin use.UsersNonuserspValue (users vs all non-users)DiabeticsNondiabeticsICU mortality, n (%)3 (9.4%)2 (13.3%)40 (31.3%)0.01930-day mortality, n (%)6 (18.8%)5 (33.3%)44 (34.4%)0.08790-day mortality, n (%)7 (21.9%)5 (33.3%)56 (43.8%)0.0291-year mortality, n (%)10 (31.3%)7 (46.7%)66 (51.6%)0.043P047Body temperature and blood lactate production in coronary artery bypass grafting patientsD Lončar-Stojiljković1, MP Stojiljkovic21Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases Dedinje, Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Belgrade, Serbia,2Faculty of Medicine, University of Banja Luka, Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology, Banja Luka, Bosnia and"

The lungs were found to be a significant source of lactate, and this pulmonary lactate flux was accentuated by CPB and hypotermia.Objective of this study was to determine an association between blood and pulmonary lactate levels after CPB and temperature in first four postoperative hours in isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).Methods:This was prospective observational study in 20 patients, ASA III classification, scheduled for elective CABG operation (one to four bypasses). Lactate concentration was measured using a lactate analyser in simultaneously drawn arterial (A) and mixed venous (V) blood samples. At the 60-min interval four measurements per patient were taken and the temperature and the haemodynamic parameters were measured (heart rate, mean arterial pressure -MAP, pCO2difference) at the same time. Concomitantly, measurements of cardiac output were also performed. Pulmonary lactate release was calculated as the product of transpulmonary A-V lactate and cardiac index. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA withposthocanalysis employing two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction.Results:The mean cardiopulmonary bypass duration was 89.43 ± (6.69) min, and the aortic cross-clamping time was 63.33 ± 20.73 min. The ejection fraction (EF) was 42.12 ± 11.72. There were no significant differences among the haemodynamic parameters. Temperature values were rising across the four hour study period. The lactate values from venous and arterial blood, as well as their differences decrease significantly over the time (Table1).Conclusions:The pulmonary lactate production during and after CABG inversely correlated with the increase in body temperature.Table 1 (abstract P047)Postoperative lactate level1 h2h3h4hTemp.35.18 ± 0.7035.67 ±0.56*36.02 ± 0.4*36.46 ± 0.59*Venous2.65 ± 1.132.17 ± 1.081.62 ± 0.78*1.48 ± 0.61*Arterial2.31 ± 1.021.76 ± 0.991.5 ± 0.811.40 ± 0.59*Lact(diff)0.34 ± 0.110.41 ± 0.090.12 ± 0.04*0.08 ± 0.02**p< 0.05 vs 1h, ¶p< 0.05 vs 2hP048The role of anion gap normalization time in the management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis. is it time for a new perspective?I Lazar1, D Orlov2, G Hazan1, A Orbach3, A Hayim4, Y Cavari2, Y Feinstein2, E Neeman2, E Hershkovitz4, Y Faingelernt11Soroka Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Pediatrics, Beer Sheva, Israel,2Soroka Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Beer Sheva, Israel,3Soroka Medical Center, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Beer Sheva, Israel,4Soroka Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Pediatric Endocrinology, Beer Sheva, IsraelCritical"

Pediatric DKA criteria include hyperglycemia (serum glucose > 200 mg/dl), acidosis (pH < 7.2) and\\or serum bicarbonate < 15 mEq/l. DKA resolution criteria (normalization of PH, bicarbonate and anion gap) are somewhat confusing because anion gap and clinical conditions improve and normalize hours before PH and bicarbonate do. This may prolong PICU admission and carry unnecessary treatments, laboratory tests and medical expenses. We hypothesized that anion gap normalization time (AGNT) correlates with the severity of DKA in children admitted to the PICU and could be a good marker for DKA resolution.Methods:We extracted data from medical charts of all PICU DKA admissions over ten years.Results:Ninety-five patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Admission age was 10 ± 4.64 years. In 87% it was their first DKA episode. Mean admission serum glucose and pH were 508 mg/dl and 7.12 respectively. Median AGNT was 8 h. Late AGNT correlated with pH < 7.1 (OR 2.94 95% CI 1.2–7.4p= 0.020) and serum glucose > 500 (OR = 3.31 95%CI 1.42–7.74,p= 0.005). Multivariate analysis showed glucose > 500 mg/dl increases the risk for delayed AGNT, by 3.41 folds and admission glucose elevation by each 25 mg/dl was associated with 10% risk increment for delayed AGNT. Median AGNT preceded median PICU discharge by 15 h (8 h vs. 23 h respectively).Conclusions:AGNT could be used for DKA recovery assessment and late AGNT correlated with markers of its severity. AGNT represents return to normal physiology—stopping ketone body (KB) production, and KB and other organic acids clearance from the serum by restoration of intravascular volume and improvement of liver, kidneys and skeletal muscle perfusion. Acidosis beyond AGNT is caused by hyperchloremia and not by DKA. Adding AGNT to the DKA resolution criteria could have shorten PICU admission time. We suggest DKA resolution criteria in children be re-evaluated and AGNT role should be further studies.P049The management of profound hyponatraemiaA Baker, S Lobaz, P DuncanBarnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Barnsley, UKCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P049Introduction:Barnsley Hospital uses the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guidelines to manage profound hyponatraemia [1], but adverse outcomes have still been reported.

Mean initial serum sodium concentration was 106.5 mmol/l. Frequency of blood sampling ranged between 1 and 11 tests in the first 48 h. Correction in the first 24 h ranged from 1 to 21 mmol/l. Correction at 24–48 h ranged from 1 to 12 mmol/l. 2.7% hypertonic saline was given in 27% of cases, all authorised by a senior clinician. With or without hypertonic saline, the rate of serum sodium correction exceeded ESICM limits in 47% cases. Overcorrection concerns were documented in one case. 11 out of 14 cases (79%) received no management for overcorrection. One patient developed osmotic demyelination syndrome. 6 of the 30 patients died during the index admission.Conclusions:High over-correction rates highlight the importance of close monitoring, prompt intervention and a low threshold for Critical Care involvement.

The hypercalcemia group comprised patients with ≥ 11.0 mg/dl serum calcium and/or albumin corrected calcium levels occurring even once in the ICU, while others were defined as the normal calcium group. All information were retrieved from the institutional electronic medical records. The primary outcome was ICU mortality.

The noticed increase in lifespan during the last decades made it the job of health care providers to ensure a good quality of care provided for these subjects. However, in areas of low resources where geriatric departments are still lacking, managing this fragile category of the population might be an even harder job to do. The goal of our study was to establish the epidemiological characteristics, as well as to draw the pathological profile of these patients.Methods:This a prospective single-center study conducted in the ED of the Aghlabids Hospital, over a two-month period, from March 2020 till April 2020. We used SPSS22.0 for analytical analysis.Results:We enrolled 276 patients. There was a slight male predominance (56.88%, n = 157). Mean age was at 72 years ranging from 65 years till 97 years. One third of the patients presented at least one comorbidity. A number of 186 patients presented a Daily Activity living (ADL) scale > 3 which means 67.4% of the patients were not self-dependent. In our study, 76.81% (n = 212) of the patients were performed additional medical investigations. Urinary tract pathologies were most common (39%, n = 107) followed by locomotor system pathologies (20%, n = 55), and surgical pathologies (14.5%, n = 40). Only 3.5% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to the resus room and only 1.25% (n = 3) of the patients needed urgent neurosurgical intervention. In our study, 56% of the patients were discharged to go home, while 44% of the patients were admitted to departments other than the ED.Conclusions:This study drew the particular and distinguished aspect of elderly patients who visit the emergency department. Trying to provide health care for such patients is challenging and requires a preestablished protocols. A geriatric department could also be a good idea since such departments are still lucking in areas of low resources such as Kairouan.P053Reduction of emergency CT diagnostic in suspected pulmonary embolism—an age- and risk-adapted protocolL Averhoff1, D Dürschmied2, K"

Positive D-dimers (DD) often trigger emergency computer tomography (CT). With this study we aimed to address the dilemma between overuse of CT scans and fear of missed PE. To rule out PE, grant a high grade of security for the patients, reduce radiation, costs, and occupied beds, we evaluated a combination of age- and risk-adapted protocol.Methods:We performed a monocentric, retrospective study on patients tested for DD in order to diagnose PE between 01/2018 and 08/2018. We analyzed patients with DD between 0.5–1.0 mg/l, using age-adjustment (recommended by the guidelines) and risk-adaption with the Well’s Score. In patients with DD ≤ 1 mg/l and the Well’s Score of ≤ 4 diagnosis of PE deemed to be unlikely. The CT scans of these low-risk patients were re-read in detail.Results:Data on DD were raised in 1,270 patients in the examined period. We excluded 1,022 patients as DD tests were carried out for other reasons than PE, or DD values were below 0.5 mg/l or over 1.0 mg/l. 148 patients were included. PE was unlikely in 60 patients using age-adjustment for DD. PE was likely in 88 patients, in 19 patients a CT scan was not performed and had to be excluded. Only 7 out of 69 patients had a Well’s score over 4 in the risk-adaption analysis. Of these 7 patients, 1 patient had a paracentral PE. Out of 62 low-risk patients, 2 patients had a subsegmental PE, 1 patient a known thrombus. This results in a reduction of 89.8% in scans in the analyzed cohort, missing 2 new minor PEs (3.2%). In the group who would have had a scan 1 out of 7 patients (14.3%) was diagnosed with a paracentral PE.Conclusions:The combination of age- and risk-adapted assessment in patients with suspected PE resulted in a convincing reduction of CT scans with a tolerable risk for missing PE.P054Routine D-dimer assessment for the prediction of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICUJ Louwsma1, B Langeveld2, J Luyendijk3, H van den Oever11Deventer Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Deventer, Netherlands,2Deventer Hospital, Department of Pulmonology, Deventer, Netherlands,3Deventer Hospital, Department of Radiology, Deventer, NetherlandsCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P054Introduction:Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common complication of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with an increased mortality risk"

D-dimer values were paired with results of CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPA), and compared in patients with and without PE on admission. In patients without PE on initial imaging and available follow-up CTPA during ICU-stay, the D-dimer increment between initial and follow-up imaging was calculated. Patients that developed PE during ICU-stay were compared with those with persistently no PE.Results:Of 124 patients, CTPA on admission was performed in 100; PE was diagnosed in 22. D-dimer values were elevated in both groups, but more in those with proven PE (median 6060, IQR 1105–16,600 vs 850, IQR 492–1570 μg/l;p< 0.0001).

Although NLR differed significantly between the survivor and non-survivor groups, this ratio was not identified as a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 lung disease as the informational index study showed low sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions:Our study showed that on-admission neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was statistically higher in non-survivors patients, however we did not find a cut-off value that could discriminate between surviving and non-surviving patients with acceptable statistical significance.P059Comparison of a cellular host response test to common sepsis indicators in a suspected infection population presenting to the emergency department (ED)H O’Neal1, R Sheybani2, T Caffery3, H Tse2, A Shah2, C Thomas11LSU Health Sciences Center / Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Baton Rouge, LA, USA,2Cytovale, LLC, Cytovale, San Francisco, CA, USA,3LSU Health Sciences Center / Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, Emergency Medicine, Baton Rouge, LA, USACritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P059Introduction:Sepsis, a common and fast-moving condition, often arises in the community, and presents to the ED where providers must perform the initial diagnosis for patients with signs of infection. Currently, a rapid diagnostic with clinically actionable performance is needed to assist ED clinicians in this task. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of the IntelliSep test when compared to commonly-assessed indicators of sepsis.Methods:The IntelliSep test is an investigational in-vitro diagnostic that quantifies the state of immune activation by measuring the biophysical properties of leukocytes from a routine blood sample in under 10 min. The test provides a single score, the IntelliSep Index (ISI), between 0.1–10.0 (inclusive), stratified into three discrete interpretation bands of risk for disease severity: Green, Yellow, and Red. Adult patients presenting to the ED with signs or suspicion of infection were prospectively enrolled at multiple sites in the USA (Feb. 2016–Sept. 2019)."

Most studied mechanism includes binding of exDNA to its receptor TLR9 to induce NFkB gene expression. Carriers of genetic variant CC of TLR9 rs352162 are predisposed to multiple organ failure and/or lethal outcome in post-trauma[1], post-stroke [2] and sepsis[3]. In a novel study, we assess whether the concentration of exDNA in plasma may limit or reveal the predictive value of rs352162 TLR9 CC genotype in multimorbidity sepsis patients.Methods:The cohort included 110 post-surgery and diabetes patients with sepsis and multimorbidities (70% with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, coronary artery diseases), Charlson index value, 7 (4–9), CIRS scale value, 23 (17–27). Circulating exDNA was isolated from plasma and quantified by CYBR Green dye.

Retrospective analysis of data using ICCA (IntelliSpace Critical Care and Anaesthesia) to compare the number of antibiotic doses administered per patient before and after introduction of PCT. After PCT introduction, we recorded the number of PCT levels requested, their frequency as well as the level of PCT and when discontinuation occurred.Results:A total of 81 patients were included—13 admitted before PCT introduction and 68 after (this important increase in the number of patients is explained by the increased proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis). The average dose of antibiotics administered per patient was reduced by 28.8% (70.24 vs 49.98) following introduction of PCT. Despite an incurred cost of £12 per PCT assay, the overall average cost per patient was reduced by £59.60 (£257.94 vs £146.78). A lack of consistency in the frequency of PCT level request was observed.Conclusions:Introduction of PCT to aid discontinuation of antibiotics resulted in a 28.8% reduction in average antibiotics prescription and an overall cost reduction of £59.60 per patient.

An improved detection of sepsis will enable earlier treatment that may influence outcome. The tested algorithm has previously retrospectively demonstrated the ability to detect ICU patients at high risk of developing sepsis within the coming hours [1].Methods:Adult patients admitted to the ICU at Skåne University Hospital Malmö from December 2020 to September 2021 were eligible for recruitment to the trial. A total of 305 subjects were randomized into one of two groups: Active algorithm, with sepsis alerts, or Standard of care. The algorithm made predictions in the whole cohort but was not displayed in the Standard of care group, in order to evaluate its performance without disturbing the outcome. The study was blinded, i.e. study personnel did not know for which subjects the algorithm was being used. The ICU followed standard practices in assessing possible development of sepsis and intervening accordingly. The subjects were followed in the study until ICU discharge.Results:The algorithm could identify patients with high risk of developing sepsis, with high performance (accuracy 0.79; sensitivity 0.80; specificity 0.78) for predictions 3 h before sepsis onset.Conclusions:The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all high, validating the prognostic accuracy of the algorithm in an ICU setting.

Clinical methods of assessing severity of disease, including National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), have been shown to predict severity in COVID-19 [1]. However, little research has been undertaken comparing NEWS2 to underlying inflammatory processes. In this study, we assessed whether inflammatory markers taken at presentation to the Emergency Department could predict and mortality in COVID-19 patients.Methods:Whole blood samples were taken at admission to the emergency department for procalcitonin, fibrinogen, CRP, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), IL-6 and TNFα. NEWS2 was also recorded on admission. Levels of inflammatory markers were retrospectively compared to NEWS2 scores and mortality outcomes.Results:A total of 95 patients positive for COVID-19 were included. NEWS2 values > 5 were associated with higher CRP (131.5 ± 87.9 vs 86.4 ± 106.5,p= 0.03), IL-6 (71.9 ± 111 vs 43.4 ± 99,p= 0.007), and vWF (334.1 ± 83.3 vs 296.3 ± 93.4,p= 0.04). The trend of increasing inflammatory markers was also shown in patients who died, significantly so for IL-6 (44.4 ± 54.97 vs 18.8 ± 48.36,p= 0.035). NEWS2 was also shown to be significantly higher in patients who died (7.8 ± 2.2 vs 4.3 ± 2.8,p= < 0.01).Conclusions:NEWS2 predicted the severity of underlying inflammatory response. All inflammatory markers showed a marked increase with severity and mortality, most significant with IL-6.

An unplanned and brutal stop of alcohol consumption, as it can occur during ICU stay, may lead to an alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) has been designed to identify medical ward patients at risk of complicated AWS, with a threshold of 4 (Sensitivity 93%; Specificity 99%) [1]. In this study, we aim to test the accuracy of PAWSS to predict complicated AWS in ICU patients.Methods:Prospective cohort of surgical ICU patients of a university-affiliated, community hospital in France. Patients eligible for a PAWSS assessment in the first 24H of their ICU stay were included. Patients were excluded if: hospital length of stay was greater than 5 days prior to ICU admission, patient under sedation, impaired neurological state, patients with AWS at admission in ICU. During their ICU stay, alcohol withdrawal signs were daily assessed by clinicians using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar). Primary outcome was the occurrence of a mild or sever AWS within 5 days.Results:A total of 618 patients were enrolled in the study. 202 patients didn’t have any alcohol consumption within the last 30 days. Among the 416 patients with alcohol consumption within the past 30 days, 61 patients had a PAWSS ≥ 4 (14.6%). For a cut-off of 4, PAWSS sensitivity for detecting a severe AWS (CIWA > 15) is 91% and specificity is 90%, and for detecting a mild AWS (CIWA > 8), sensitivity is 80% and specificity 91%.Conclusions:PAWSS is an excellent tool to predict severe AWS in ICU patients (Fig.1).

We aimed to describe the need for RBC transfusion in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC at a university hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, during the perioperative period and to explore possible associations with clinical outcomes.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC at a university hospital from 2007 to 2018. We excluded patients with blood dyscrasia, active infection, and surgical injury (vessel or solid organ). We recorded the number of RBC units transfused in the perioperative period and clinical outcomes as ICU and hospital stay, days on mechanical ventilation, ICU readmission, days to oral intake and ambulation. We used descriptive statistics according to variable distribution. Exploratory analyses were performed using ANOVA, chi-square, or Fisher exact test as appropriate.Results:A sample of 130 patients was analyzed. No transfusion was needed in 12% of patients, 50% required less than 4 units, and 38% received at least 4 units. Patients who required transfusion had a lower mean hemoglobin than those who were not transfused (single-factor ANOVAp< 0.01). BMI < 18 and bleeding > 1500 ml were associated with transfusion of ≥ 4 units of RBC (p0.016 andp< 0.01, respectively). BMI in the overweight range was associated with no transfusions (p0.016). Exploratory analysis showed that the ICU stay was longer in patients transfused (p< 0.01) and more days of ventilation were needed when ≥ 4 units were transfused (p0.036).Conclusions:Most patients programed for CRS/HIPEC will need transfusion. Risk factors in our study are underweight, heavy bleeding, and inferior preoperative hemoglobin.ReferenceFisher OM et al.

Data from VHAs were compared with conventional laboratory tests with Spearman’s correlation coefficient.Results:A total of 75 patients were recruited. The median (IQR) age was 67 (57–78) years, and 42 (56.0%) were male. Upon enrolment, they had a mean APACHE IV score of 96 ± 33. Up to 25 (33.3%) patients had documented bacteremia. The median time to results availability was 77.4 min (60.3–107.3) for platelet, 106.0 min (84.2–167.8) for clotting time, and 120.9 min (88.8–179.6) for fibrinogen. It took a median time of 5 min (5–10) for ROTEM® and 10 min (10–10) for TEG® to achieve interpretable results. Assessment for hyperfibrinolysis took a mean time of 60.0 ± 0.0 min for ROTEM® and 50.6 ± 5.8 min for TEG®. There were significant positive correlations between platelet and CRT A10 (correlation coefficient, r = 0.86), and between fibrinogen and CFF A10 (r = 0.77) of TEG® (Fig.1). ROTEM®showed similar findings, with EXTEM A5 correlating well with platelet (r = 0.90), and FIBTEM A5 with fibrinogen (r = 0.81). The correlation between VHAs and clotting time were less optimal.Conclusions:There was good correlation between VHAs and platelet and fibrinogen levels in patients with sepsis, with a much shorter turnaround time.Fig. 1 (abstract P071)Scatter plots of platelet and fibrinogen with TEG® and ROTEM® parameters showing good correlation (graphs a-d); prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) with TEG® and ROTEM® parameters showing less optimal correlation (graphs e-h).P072Clot microstructure (df) as a biomarker and measurement of thrombogenicity in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD)S Pillai1, JC Zaldua1, M Lawrence1, J Whitley1, M Howard1, O Watson1, K Harrison2, K Hawkins3, K Morris4, PA Evans11Welsh Centre for Emergency Medicine Research, Emergency Department, Morriston Hospital, Swansea, UK,2Morriston Hospital, Swansea, UK,3Swansea University, Swansea, UK,4Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cardiff, UKCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P072Introduction:COPD is a chronic inflammatory condition that leads to lung parenchymal changes and microvascular damage.

Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of weight-adjustedvs.empiric dosing of fibrinogen replacement.Methods:Thispost-hocanalysis of the FIBRES randomized controlled trial included adults experiencing clinically significant bleeding and hypofibrinogenemia after cardiac surgery at 11 Canadian centers and utilized empiric dosing of fibrinogen concentrate (FC; Fibryga®, Octapharma; 4 g) or cryoprecipitate (10 IU) [1]. Patients were grouped into quartiles based on increasing weight-adjusted dosing of either product. The primary outcome was the number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused within 24 h of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Results:The median weight-adjusted FC dose was 52 mg/kg (IQR 45–61; n = 372) and 1.30 U/10 kg (IQR 1.11–1.54; n = 363) for cryoprecipitate.

Patients on FXaI can experience major bleeding associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization. Therefore, reversal/hemostatic agents are used to control FXaI-related bleeding. The efficacy/safety of PCCs as hemostatic agents for FXaI-related bleeding requires further investigation.Methods:LEX-210 (NCT04867837) is a Phase 3, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, group-sequential, parallel-group, adaptive design study. Key inclusion criteria include major bleeding and DOAC level ≥ 100 ng/ml equivalent; exclusion criteria include life-threatening bleeding and acute trauma for which hemostatic agent alone would not control bleeding. LEX-210 will enroll ~ 200 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive 50 IU/kg or 15 IU/kg 4F-PCC to demonstrate superior hemostatic efficacy of high dose 4F-PCC for emergent FXaI-related major bleeding. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with effective (excellent/good rating) or non-effective (poor/none rating) hemostasis in bleeding management within 24 h of 4F-PCC, as assessed by an independent adjudication committee according to predefined criteria (Fig.1) [1]. Secondary endpoints include changes in endogenous thrombin potential; 30-day rate of thromboembolic events, all-cause mortality and adverse events; vital signs; and laboratory parameters.Results:LEX-210 commenced in Q4 2021 and will be performed at ~ 60 sites in North America and Europe.

Changes in coagulation markers have been well described in critically unwell patients on ICU. There is less clear evidence regarding these changes at the time of presentation to the Emergency Department and the progression of disease over time. We sought to investigate how coagulation markers change over the course of COVID-19 infection and whether they might predict disease severity.Methods:Patients were recruited from a single University Teaching Hospital ED at the time of presentation. Those with a positive PCR test were followed up throughout their stay. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was performed on arrival, after 24 h, 3–5 days and 7 days, alongside routine haematological and biochemical testing. ROTEM values at each of these time points were analysed, and compared. Length of stay and patient outcome were also recorded for subgroup analysis. The ROTEM parameters selected for analysis were both EXTEM and INTEM Clotting Time (CT), Clot Formation Time (CFT), Maximal Clot Firmness (MCF), Alpha Angle (Alpha) and Maximum Lysis Percentage (ML). This reflects clot formation kinetics, mechanical strength and clot breakdown via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.Results:EXTEM (7.64 ± 5.53 vs 11.83 ± 6.30) and INTEM ML (4.69 ± 3.55 vs 9.95 ± 5.22) were significantly reduced in those who died vs patients with a prolonged hospital stay. Over time there were no patterns of change to ROTEM values in any outcome group.Conclusions:Comparisons between groups demonstrated that one distinguishing feature between those who require ICU admission or die of COVID-19 compared with those who survive a prolonged hospital stay to discharge was the extent to which fibrinolysis could occur. Failure to break clots down could be a significant mechanism in the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19.P078Viscoelastic testing in COVID-19 infection demonstrates a resistance to low molecular weight heparinO Watson1, M Howard2, J Cezar-Zaldua2, J Whitley2, S Pillai2, M Lawrence2, K Guy2, K Hawkins3, K Morris4, PA Evans21Welsh Centre for Emergency Medicine Research, Emergency Department, Swansea, UK,2Welsh Centre for Emergency Medicine Research, Swansea, UK,3Swansea University, Swansea,"

We use viscoelastic testing to investigate changes to coagulation profile over the progression of COVID-19 infection.Methods:Patients presenting to a single large University Teaching Hospital ED were recruited at presentation. Those with positive COVID-19 PCR test were included for analysis. Whole blood samples were taken for viscoelastic tests. Fractal Dimension (Df) and Time to Gel Point (TGP) are biomarkers of thrombogenicity which measure the biomechanical properties of the incipient clot [1]. Patients were followed up throughout their hospital stay, with sampling taken at arrival, after 24 h, 3–5 days and 7 days. Length of stay and patient outcome were recorded and used for subgroup analysis. Once admitted to the hospital all patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as per standard treatment pathways, if commenced before the first sample was taken, this was recorded and controlled for.Results:Dfand TGPshowed no changes over time in COVID-19 infection. Subgroup analysis also showed no differences in Dfor TGPin different outcome groups. Patients who received LMWH from the clinical team before recruitment to the study demonstrated no significant difference in Df (1.715 ± 0.061 no LMWH vs 1.699 ± 0.068 with LMWH), but TGPwas prolonged in those receiving LMWH(445.0 ± 195.2 vs 307.6 ± 91.6). Additionally there was no correlation between Anti-Xa level and Df.Conclusions:The therapeutic efficacy of LMWH appears to be blunted in COVID-19 infection. This may be due to the inflammatory state creating a resistance to the activity of LMWH, and may in part explain why LMWH appears to have less effect in reducing thromboembolic disease in COVID-19 than it does in other disease states.ReferenceEvans et al.

In the Phase 3 HERCULES trial (NCT02553317), caplacizumab (CPLZ) treatment resulted in significantly faster time to platelet count normalization versus placebo (PBO). Aim: to characterize the durability of platelet count responses in the HERCULES trial.Methods:This was a post hoc analysis of the HERCULES intent-to-treat population (CPLZ, n = 72; PBO, n = 73). We identified patients with fast platelet count response and described the exacerbation rate. Time to durable platelet count response, time to complete remission (CR), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated.Results:Most patients achieved initial platelet count normalization ≤ 3 days (CPLZ, 56/72 [78%]; PBO, 43/73 [59%]). In patients with fast platelet count response (≤ 3 days), exacerbation rate was 4% (2/56) with CPLZ and 44% (19/43) with PBO. In patients with time to platelet count response > 3 days, exacerbation rate was 7% (1/15) with CPLZ and 30% (9/30) with PBO. Of patients who had exacerbations, 90% (CPLZ, 2/3; PBO, 26/28) switched to open-label CPLZ, which may have favored outcomes of PBO patients. Median (95% confidence interval) time to durable response was 4.5 (4.4–4.6) days with CPLZ and 10.5 (6.5–14.5) days with PBO (Fig.1A); median time to CR was 40.0 (37.7–41.1) days with CPLZ and 44.2 (42.0–48.2) days with PBO (Fig.1B). Overall RFS during the study period demonstrated early and sustained benefit for CPLZ over PBO (Fig.1C).Conclusions:CPLZ was associated with a faster and sustained platelet count response versus PBO, where many fast responders subsequently had an exacerbation.

AntiXa (aXa) monitoring of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended by the 2002 EAST guidelines following initiation of therapy or after dose changes in some patients [2]. This study evaluates the efficacy of a pharmacist-led protocol for enoxaparin dose adjustment based on aXa levels in trauma patients.Methods:This single-center retrospective chart review included adult trauma patients admitted from 3/1/2018 to 6/20/2020. Patients received LMWH per protocol based on body mass index (BMI). Patients with BMI < 40 kg/m2received enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily, and patients with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2received enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily. The goal therapeutic range based on peak level was 0.2–0.4 IU/ml. The primary objective was time to goal peak aXa level after enoxaparin initiation. Secondary objectives include enoxaparin dosing regimen in milligrams and milligrams per kilogram, number of adjustments to reach goal level, rates of VTE, and rates of bleeding attributed to enoxaparin.Results:Ultimately, 635 patients met inclusion criteria. Median time to goal antiXa was 2 days (IQR 2–4) [Table1]. Peak aXa levels were within the goal range for 43.2% of patients on the first check. Of the 66 patients with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2, 14/66 (21.2%) were initially dosed below protocol and 20/66 (30.3%) of these patients met goal aXa at first check. Of the 569 patients with BMI < 40 kg/m2, 535/569 (94.0%) were initially dosed according to protocol and 254/569 (44.6%) of these patients met goal antiXa at first check. Rates of VTE were similar for all patients, and the overall rate of bleeding was low.Conclusions:This study demonstrates the safety of a pharmacist-led enoxaparin dosing protocol based on low rates of bleeding events. The rate of VTE events was low despite less than half of patients achieving goal aXa level on first check.ReferencesWalker CK et al. Ann Pharmacother 51:323–331, 2017.Rogers FB et al.

Biomarkers that identify patients at risk of postoperative complications could guide management in this setting [1]. Our purpose was to explore associations between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) to clinical outcomes. We hypothesized inflammation is associated with worse outcomes.Methods:A retrospective cohort study including patients taken to CRS/HIPEC in 2017 at a university hospital was conducted. Patients were excluded if they presented an active infection, surgical trauma, and lacked preoperatory laboratories. NLR and PLR were calculated from complete blood counts obtained preoperatively, 24-, 48-, 72-h and 7 days after surgery. Inflammation was defined as NLR > 2.5 and PLR > 90. Primary outcomes were ICU stay, hospital stay, days of mechanical ventilation, and days to start ambulation and oral intake. Mann–Whitney and chi-square test were carried as appropriate.Results:We included 127 patients in our study. Inflammation according to NLR was present in 30.7%, 96.9%, 99.2%, 98.4%, and 91.3% of patients before surgery, 24-, 48-, 72-h and 7 days after surgery, respectively.

A PLR > 90 48-h postoperative was associated with more days of mechanical ventilation (p0.049). Inflammation determined by NLR and PLR was not associated with other outcomes at the timepoints evaluated.Conclusions:CRS/HIPEC is a complex procedure that requires ICU care.

ICU admission rates reduced from 85.7% in 2020 to 25% in 2021 until May. 20% needed cardiovascular support, 15% needed intubation and 5% required high flow nasal oxygen. The median length of stay in hospital was 25.5 (IQR 18.5–32.7) days. Table1illustrates the demographics of CART patients with neurotoxicity during hospital admission. Using outcome analysis, by day 28, 60% of patients were in complete remission and 15% of patients were refractory to treatment. In terms of patient survival, 95% were alive at day 28 and 66.6% at 12 months.Conclusions:CART cell therapy patients have high ICU requirements with relatively high rates of toxicities, but this is changing with novel therapies, better patient selection and greater confidence in management of these patients in the ward setting. Excellent communication between oncologists, critical care outreach team and the ICU team and education of ward staff is key in ensuring prompt identification and escalation of care in CART patients at risk of deterioration.Table 1 (abstract P083)The demographics of our cohort of CART patients who developed neurotoxicity.

There are some circumstances where persistent ventilation (PV) is continued. Data is limited to guide decision-making. Clinicians will choose not to extubate on the assumption that benefits outweigh the risks. Our hypothesis is that this strategy remains uncertain, with risks being potentially significant [1].Methods:Our site, like most hospitals in the UK, submits data to National Emergency Laparotomy Audit. These were cross referenced with WardWatcher and ICCA, collated in Excel and analysed with GraphPad. Analyses were retrospective and did not include paper notes.Results:In a two year period, 274 patients had surgery with data in the NELA database, 195 were admitted to ICU.

Perhaps the most robust indication for PV is significantly impaired oxygenation or inadequate ventilation. Patients arriving out of hours were more likely to remain ventilated, the risks of extubation may not be greater [2]. Adverse outcomes in the PV group are likely to be influenced by the reasons for PV, however it’s conceivable thatinitselfPV could have a significant influence on outcome, and deserves further study.ReferencesNabozny et al.

ICU consultants make numerous high consequence decisions on patients with complex pathology in time-critical scenarios. The aim of the study was to identify the density of decision making and its consequences on the quality of the decisions made by ICU consultants in our unit.Methods:This study took place across four twenty-four-hour on-call periods. Each consultant was monitored by a dedicated ICU trainee who recorded the daytime data. Demographic variables included the age, seniority of the ICU consultants, acuity of patients on the unit and staffing gaps. Baseline measurements included the number of days the consultant had been on the unit, their decision fatigue scale (DFS) score [1] and their reaction times. Real-time measurements of the number of decisions and interruptions during the on-call period were documented.Results:Our study demonstrated increased reaction times and DFS scores for all consultants post-on-call compared with their baseline measurements (Table1).Conclusions:This study highlighted the number of decisions and interruptions consultants experience throughout their day. Signs of decision fatigue and reduced confidence in decision making were evident. Strategies to help reduce this could include moving non-urgent decisions to an alternative time of the day and a 'silent cockpit' rule to reduce non-urgent interruptions during ward rounds.ReferenceHickman RL Jr et al.

General questions were supplemented with standardized tests: anxiety (GAD7); insomnia (ISI); traumatic impact (IESr); and depression (PHQ9).Results:During four periods, 255 questionnaires were completed, including 52 by ICU and 38 by ED nurses. See Table1for a summary of the results and relevant p values. IES-r median scores were highest among ICU nurses (16.5). ICU nurses reported more sadness about working with COVID-19 patients as compared to non-critical care nurses (relative risk, RR 3.8). At the same time ICU nurses reported more often feeling sufficiently safe as compared to ED (RR 1.4) and non-critical nurses (RR 1.3). Leisure time for ICU nurses consisted more often of passive indoor activities (RR 2.3) and hobbies (RR 2.2) as opposed to more active leisure activities by non-critical care nurses. Most results for ICU nurses remained consistent regardless of registration period. However their fear decreased over time (RR 0.3,p= 0.012) and they felt more sufficiently trained (RR 1.5,p= 0.046). ED nurses felt less committed towards patient care when compared to non-critical care nurses (RR 0.9). ED nurses felt the hospital was less prepared to deal with continuing outbreaks when compared to non-critical care nurses (RR 0.5). On other subjects ED nurses did not differ significantly.Conclusions:The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be worse on our ICU nurses when compared to ED nurses and non-critical care nurses. The impact of the pandemic seems to be more traumatic causing more sadness among our ICU nurses with less active leisure activities. Our ED nurses on the other hand feel the hospital is less prepared for ongoing outbreaks and feel less motivated to continue care.Table 1 (abstract P087)Overview of significant differences between nursing groupsED nurseICU nurseNon-critical care nursepvalueIES-r score (traumatic impact); median12.016.510.00.025 (Dunn’s test)Sadness towards possible COVID-19 exposure8.1%11.8%3.1%0.026 (Fisher’s Exact)Sufficiently safe67.6%92.0%72.6%0.008; .003 (Fisher’s Exact)Passive leisure time inside24.2%41.7%18.1%< 0.001 (Chi2)Hobbies as leisure time27.3%29.2%13.2%0.011 (Chi2)Full commitment towards patient care83.3%89.6%95.7%0.006 (Chi2)Sufficiently prepared for new outbreak40.0%77.3%72.9%0.016 (Chi2)P088Impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on burnout development in intensive care unitsA Omar1, A Labib2, S Hanoura2, A"

Over time, it has been reported that certain health care specialties are more vulnerable to BOS, such as those working in an intensive care unit (ICU). The introduction of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its growing demand, adds to the overall workload in ICU, and exposes practitioners to complex ethical and administrative situations, which may impact their psychological well-being. We aim to investigate the effects of an ECMO service, on BOS development in the ICU.Methods:We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study, using an online questionnaire; The Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel. In addition, demographic variables, workload, salary satisfaction, and caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were assessed. Participants were divided based on working in ICU with ECMO service into ICU with (ECMO-ICU) and without (non-ECMO-ICU) ECMO service, and burnout status (burnout and no burnout).Results:The response rate for completing the questionnaire was 36.4% (445/1222). Males represented 53.7% of the participants. The overall prevalence of burnout was 64.5%. The overall burnout prevalence did not differ between ECMO- and non-ECMO-ICU groups (64.5% and 63.7, respectively). However, personal accomplishment (PA) score was significantly lower among ECMO-ICU personnel compared to those in a non-ECMO ICU (42.7% versus 52.6,p= 0.043). Significant predictors of burnout included profession (nurse or physician), acquiring COVID-19 infection, knowing other practitioners who were infected with COVID-19, salary dissatisfaction, and extremes of workload.Conclusions:Burnout was equally prevalent among participants from ECMO- and non-ECMO ICU, but PA was lower among participants in ICU with an ECMO service. The reported high prevalence of burnout, and its predictors, requires special attention to try and reduce its occurrence.P089The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on intensive care workload at Mater Dei Hospital in Malta.C Mizzi, MB Buttigieg, S Sciberras, C Tua, S Santucci, K Torpiano, N Grech, M Drake, B SpiteriMater Dei Hospital, Intensive Care, Msida, MaltaCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P089Introduction:The aim of the study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on intensive care workload [1,2] at our only acute main general hospital on the island.

The impact of the Coronavirus 19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic on CCNI in terms of increased strain and infection control measures, is uncertain. Departmental strain has the potential to confound impact of infection control measures aimed to reduce CCNI incidence. This study will describe the impact of 2019-nCoV on non-COVID CCNI incidence and mortality.Methods:A retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to critical care in one Central London teaching hospital. CCNI incidence, (diagnosed ≥ 48 h post critical care admission), was compared between pre (Jan 2019–Feb 2020) and peak COVID (Mar 2020-Jun 2020).Results:Of 2,266 patients, 1788 were admitted pre and 478 peak COVID. Mean age was 57.2 years and 56.1 years pre and peak COVID respectively, with 35.5% and 37.4% of patients, female. There was a significant increase in rate of total CCNI incidence (1.6% to 3.6%) in the pre and peak period respectively. There was a significant increase in rate of incidence of gram negative bacterium andC.diff, but not in gram positive bacterium, MRSA, VRE and fungus. The increase in rate of peak (23.5%) compared to pre COVID (13.5%) CCNI non-COVID mortality, was not significant (Table1).Conclusions:Increased infection control measures did not protect against non-COVID CCNI and mortality across all infection types. Increased strain is likely to confound additional infection control measures and resulted in excess patient non-COVID CCNI and mortality, secondary to the pandemic. Greater emphasis is needed to protect other patients from expected CCNIs.Referenceshttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/surveillance-report-HAI-Net-ICU-mortality-2008-2012.pdfAccessed 27/1/22Dasgupta S et al.

    "full_text": "modeling for COVID-19 patients with sepsis remains poor. To address this deficit, we assessed the impact of culture positivity on in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients with sepsis. We report that culture positive sepsis derived from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a stronger prognostic indicator of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients than the Sequential Organ Failure Score (SOFA). These results support inclusion of culture status in future clinical scoring systems.Methods:The cohort was defined by inpatients from 03/20 to 09/21 with a COVID-19 + test (PCR, rapid-antigen, antibody) and septic event (n = 792) as defined by Sepsis-3 guidelines [1]. Each patient's worst SOFA score was computed during their suspected infection window (defined as 24 h prior to and 48 h after the first antibiotic administration or body-fluid culture taken). Study groups included culture positive (n = 478) and culture negative (n = 314) sepsis patients. Charlson comorbidity scores for each patient were calculated prior admission. Positive predictors of in-hospital mortality were assessed with multivariate logistic regression and evaluated for statistical significance using the CAR-ANOVA Type-III test with Bonferroni method.Results:Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that culture positivity had the greatest adjusted odds ratio (OR: 3.19, 95% CI: 2.09–4.98,p< 0.001, corr.p< 0.001), compared to worst SOFA score (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.61–2.27,p< 0.001, corr.p< 0.001), patient age (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.20–1.80,p< 0.001, corr.p< 0.001), male sex (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.15–2.42,p< 0.006, corr.p= NS) and comorbidity score (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84–1.22,p= NS, corr.p= NS) (Fig.1).Conclusions:Culture positivity is a strong prognostic indicator of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 sepsis patients and warrants investigation as a candidate variable for future clinical outcome algorithms.ReferenceSinger et al.

There were no differences between OP and non-OP regarding age, gender, SAPSII or comorbidities. Although patients with OP more frequently underwent IMV (p< 0.01), time from symptoms until IMV was longer (10.1 ± 6.1 in C vs 11.9 ± 6.1 days,p= 0.02).

We explored the kinetics of fibrosis markers and ventilatory parameters prior to and following use of steroids to treat suspected PF. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of early dexamethasone (DEXA) treatment, the current standard-of-care for COVID-19, on the incidence and time to development of PF and clinical outcomes.Methods:We included 191 critically ill COVID-19 patients spanning two treatment cohorts: no DEXA treatment (pre-DEXA cohort, n = 67) and dexamethasone treatment as standard-of-care (DEXA cohort, n = 124). Kinetics of circulating fibrosis markers and ventilatory parameters were analyzed in suspected PF patients prior to and following initiation of steroid therapy as well as in patients in whom PF was not suspected. Furthermore, associations between PF and clinical outcomes were explored.Results:Patients with suspected PF exhibited higher circulating fibrosis markers, lower lung compliance and PaO2/FiO2ratios, and increased dead space ventilation. Incidence of suspected PF was 28% in the pre-DEXA cohort and 25% in the DEXA cohort (p= 0.61), and time to development of suspected PF was also similar between cohorts (16 [12–21] vs. 19 [14–23] days from ICU admission,p= 0.11). Time on ventilator, LOS in ICU and mortality were significantly higher in suspected PF patients than in no suspected PF patients, with no differences between the cohorts (Fig.1).Conclusions:Increased circulating fibrosis markers reflect development of PF in critically ill COVID-19 patients, which is associated with prolonged ICU length of stay and high mortality rates.

Management with high dose steroids reduces mortality and has become standard practice. However, high dose glucocorticoid therapy impairs glucose metabolism in patients already at risk of insulin resistance and impaired insulin production, resulting in increased incidence of hyperglycaemia [1].Methods:A retrospective audit was undertaken, collecting data on steroid use, glycaemic control, and insulin treatment in 100 patients admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital Intensive Care Unit with COVID-19. A standard operating procedure (SOP) for the treatment of steroid induced hyperglycaemia was created, based on guidelines from the National Inpatient Diabetes COVID-19 Response Group [1].Results:Of 100 patients, 91 received high dose steroids. The majority (64.8%) experienced glycaemic control issues, defined as one episode of blood sugar > 12 mmol/l. Of the patients treated with 6 mg dexamethasone 52% experienced hyperglycaemia, compared to 71% of those treated with higher steroid doses. There was no significant difference in the highest blood sugar level of either cohort (t54 = − 0.450,p= 0.654). The average time between first episode of hyperglycaemia and commensal of insulin was 76 h. There was a lack of consensus in management of steroid-induced hyperglycaemia—no treatment was administered in 37% of patients. In those who were treated, 19 different combinations of insulin were given. Sliding scale insulin was administered in most patients who experienced no further hyperglycaemia.Conclusions:These results highlight a necessity for consensus management of steroid induced hyperglycaemia. In line with these findings, the devised SOP recommends initial therapy with rapid acting insulin and administration of a sliding scale if hyperglycaemia persists.ReferenceRayman G et al.

The use of corticosteroids (CS) has shown good effect on both attenuation of HIS and outcome. However, CS use has also been associated with increasing incidence of opportunistic infections in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We investigated whether opportunistic infections with Aspergillus species (Asp) or Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) were more common after implementation of the RECOVERY trial results.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed all patients that were admitted to our ICU for severe COVID-19 induced respiratory failure from 03/20 until 01/21. We identified a total of 186 patients that were dichotomized according to dexamethasone administration upon admission (DEX vs NO-DEX). Patient baseline characteristics, mode of ventilation and survival rates are shown in Fig.1.Results:Patient baseline characteristics did not differ between both groups (Wilcoxonp> 0.05). In the NO-DEX group, 35 patients were treated with high dose CS for perceived HIS, while rescue CS were used in 21 DEX-group patients. A total of 42 patients received one or more broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL): 18 DEX patients and 24 NO-DEX patients. In the DEX group, Asp antigen was detected in 8 BAL (44%), while HSV DNA was found in 11 BAL (61%). In the NO-DEX group, 10 BAL (42%) were positive for Asp antigen and HSV DNA was detected in 19 BAL (79%). Approximately 70% of positive BAL results in the NO-DEX group originated from patients that had received CS.Conclusions:We identified a total of 18 (43%) Aspergillus positive and 30 (71%) HSV DNA positive BAL results.

AI considered were ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchitis (VAT), bacteremia, CVC associated infections, urinary tract infections and soft skin tissue infections. Baseline characteristics, 3-months previous antibiotic (ATB) exposure, ATB treatment at ICU-admission and clinical management of COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed.Results:Of the 159 patients included, with a median (IQR) age of 66 (57–72) and 63.5% males, 14 (8.8%) had no known comorbidities. A total of 63 patients(39.6%) developed AI: 45(71.4%) VAP, 20(33.3%) VAT, 28 (45.2%) UTI, 6 (9.5%) CVC associated infections and 3(4.8%) soft skin tissue infections. In univariate analysis, both SOFA score at admission (p< 0.001), acute cardiovascular (p= 0.003) and neurologic (p= 0.006) disfunction at ICU admission were associated with the development of AI. AI were also correlated to need of tracheostomy(p< 0.001), development of delirium (p< 0.001) or shock (p< 0.001); and with longer ICU and in-hospital stay (p< 0.001) and ICU and hospital mortality (p= 0.011 andp= 0.011, respectively). None of the COVID-19 pharmacologic treatments considered (remdesivir, steroids and tocilizumab), neither different regimens of ATB therapy at ICU admission were significantly associated with AI.Conclusions:In this cohort, almost 40% of the patients developed AI, that was associated with 4 times higher hazard of needing mechanical ventilation and higher rate of adverse events such as delirium, shock during in-ICU stay and longer length of ICU and in-hospital stay.P104The rate of secondary infections and diagnostic challenges in critically ill patients with COVID-19G McCreath1, MRS Ralston2, AJ Roe1, MJ Watson3, MAB Sim31Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK,2Institute of Cardiovascular & Medical Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK,3School of Medicine, Dentistry & Nursing, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UKCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P104Introduction:Patients admitted to intensive care with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection frequently present with sepsis. These patients are at a higher risk of developing a secondary infection, but this can be difficult to distinguish from the primary viral infection [1].

Half of the patients had at least one clinically significant positive microbial culture, however a much higher proportion (73%) were treated with antibiotics.Conclusions:Secondary infections can be difficult to diagnose in the presence of severe COVID-19 disease, with a disproportionally high use of antibiotics relative to positive cultures.

Only subjects who started MV for at least 48 h during their ICU admission were included. VAP patients and MV patients who did not develop VAP (MVnon-VAP) were identified retrospectively and randomly included in a 1:1 ratio. Demographic information, VAP-related characteristics, and baseline severity scores were captured from medical records.Results:197 VAP patients and 197 MVnon-VAP patients were included. A larger number of patients (46.7%) in the MV non-VAP group were aged 70 years or older,p= 0.021. The main reasons for ICU admission were different between groups. Differences were also observed in severity scores between VAP and non-VAP patients (SAPSII,p= 0.048) (Fig.1). On healthcare resource utilization, statistical differences (p< 0.001) were observed between VAP vs MVNon-VAP patients in hospital (61 vs 35.9 days, respectively) and ICU LOS (27.5 vs 11 days, respectively). Also, MV duration was always higher for VAP patients (20.7 vs 8 days, respectively,p< 0.001).Conclusions:Among MV patients, VAP group experienced more hospitalizations and longer LOS, supporting a large healthcare resource utilization required by VAP which might lead to higher admission costs. Several limitations must be considered in this retrospective study including the different criteria associated to VAP diagnosis in each center.

We implemented an active surveillance system in our ICU. Early and timely detection, together with optimal organ support management could have influenced clinical outcomes, lowering the ICU mortality rate. In our sample, this mortality is not statistically significant despite being higher than in the non-CAPA group.

Critical care patients are most at risk of nosocomial infection (NI), morbidity and mortality due to underlying co-morbidities, acute disease processes and increased use of interventions [1,2]. However, many patients are at risk of NI pre-admission to the critical care unit which also impact on patient outcomes. Limited data exist on the impact of admission versus critical care acquired NI on patient mortality, length of stay (LOS) and costs.Methods:Retrospective analysis of adult (aged ≥ 18 years critical care patients (stay ≥ 48 h) admitted to one of three critical care units at one Central London hospital between Apr 2011–Jun 2020.Results:18,864 patients were admitted to critical care during the study period. 40.2% of patients were female, mean patient age was 57.9 years with an overall patient mortality of 15.8%.

We proposed that the efficacy and sensitivity of fosfomycin has decreased similarly to other first line antibiotics since the publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines in 2011 [1]. Because fosfomycin sensitivities are not routinely performed, results of this clinical outcome based study may guide direction of microbiologic testing in an aim to reduce treatment failure with empiric fosfomycin prescribing.Methods:This retrospective chart review included adult patients prescribed fosfomycin in the inpatient or outpatient setting at Hennepin Healthcare from January 1, 2019 to October 31, 2021. The primary outcomes were return to clinic, hospital, or emergency department within 30 days for ongoing infection and additional antibiotic courses for UTI within 14 days.Results:Eighty four patients with 107 encounters met inclusion criteria. Fosfomycin was prescribed for diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI in 94/107 (87%) of cases and 73/107 (68%) was in relation to a known culture result versus 34/107 (34%) was empirically prescribed. Of cultures collected (n = 103), 47% were ESBL producing organisms and 53% were non-ESBL producing organisms. The 30 day return rate for ongoing symptom management was 23% (25/107) and 21% (23/107) received further antibiotics within 14 days.Conclusions:Fosfomycin may have worsening clinical cure rates when compared to historical data.

To reduce PI after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), perioperative antimicrobial therapy (AMT) is often prophylactically administered. At our hospital, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) or piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) is given in the absence or presence of biliary stenting respectively. The objective of this study is to analyze antimicrobial susceptibility of perioperative biliary cultures in relation to prophylactic AMT and the incidence of PI.Methods:All adult patients undergoing PD in our hospital from 2015 until 2020 were evaluated for inclusion.

The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of different prognostic markers on the outcome of patients with ALF.Methods:We conducted a retrospective observational study enrolling 40 patients who presented acute liver failure (ALF) at the emergency department of an university hospital from May 2016 to May 2020. The main etiologies of ALF were paracetamol poisoning and Fulminant viral hepatitis. We collected, analyzed and compared the data of 2 groups of 20 patients with ALF: a first group of survivors and a second group of non-survivors. The patients were 35±15 years old without anterior comorbidity. Patients’ baseline characteristics were well matched between groups. In the two groups, we measured and recorded blood lactate level at T0, T12 h and T24 h, arterial ammonia concentration at T0, T24 h and T 48 h, blood fibrinogen level, INR, biological parameters particularly blood sodium and serum creatinine. We registered the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), of renal replacement therapy (RRT), the incidence of grade 3–4 hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and cerebral edema.

Different studies proposed to discontinue therapy when > 3 organs fail or a CLIF-C ACLF score of > 64 points at day 3–7 after admission is present. However, the outcome of critically ill cirrhotic patients with prolonged ICU stay (≥ 7 days) remains largely unclear.Methods:Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all patients with liver cirrhosis admitted to the Department of Intensive Care Medicine of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) between 01/2009 and 01/2017. Demographics, clinical parameters, length of ICU stay and mortality as well as common ICU and liver specific scores were assessed.Results:We could identify 1041 patients with liver cirrhosis, of those 32% (n = 335) had a prolonged ICU stay (≥ 7 days). In the multivariate regression analysis, a prolonged ICU stay was independently associated with SAPS II [OR 0.981, 95% CI (0.971 to 0.991);p< 0.001], vasopressor therapy [OR 4.355, 95% CI (2.715 to 6.521);p< 0.001], mechanical ventilation [OR 4.208, 95% CI (2.715 to 6.521);p< 0.001], RRT [OR 2.531, 95% CI (1.809 to 3.541);p< 0.001] and antibiotic therapy [OR 6.475, 95% CI (2.508 to 16.718);p< 0.001]. After 28-/90 days 48% vs. 35% and 62% vs. 42% patients with prolonged or non-prolonged ICU stay had died or received liver transplantation, respectively (bothp< 0.001). Best predictors for 28-day mortality of patients with prolonged ICU stay were CLIF-C ACLFLactate(AUC 0.781) and CLIF-SOFA (AUC 0.780) score.Conclusions:One third of critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis presents with a prolonged ICU stay.

In theory one assumes that reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines helps to gain control over the systemic inflammation process, hereby preventing further progress of ACLF and improve survival.Methods:The CYTOHEP study is designed to assess the benefit of extracorporeal hemoadsorption using the CytoSorb (CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) device in patients with ACLF. The CytoSorb device will be used in addition to continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for 72 h and will be compared to a control group treated with CRRT alone. For safety assessment, a third group will be assessed without CRRT and extracorporeal hemoadsorption. All patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion in one of the study groups.Results:Our primary endpoint of the study is that extracorporeal hemoadsorption using the CytoSorb adsorber in combination with CRRT in patients with ACLF is a safe and efficient method to reduce bilirubin. In order to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of ACLF and to better understand the mode of action of the CytoSorb device a broad array of inflammatory parameters are examined.Conclusions:The extracorporeal hemoadsorption with CytoSorb is clinically widely applied but lacks reliable evidence. Its application in ACLF is not justifiable since randomized controlled studies are non-existent. The CYTOHEP study attempts to elucidate the role of extracorporeal hemoadsorption in the systemic inflammation process and progress of ACLF and represents an innovative and novel approach in the therapy of ACLF.ReferencesArroyo V et al.

Although there is not enough evidence about when to start feeding in intensive care patients, it is recommended to start feeding within 24–48 h with hemodynamically stable condition. Conditions such as surgery, sepsis and trauma increase the energy needs of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the first enteral nutrition time of patients with trauma followed up in the pediatric intensive care unit.Methods:The cases followed up between July 2018 and June 2019 in our pediatric intensive care unit due to trauma were examined. The demographic, clinic findings and first enteral nutrition hours of the patient were recorded retrospectively.Results:A total of 49 patients with trauma were included in the study. The ages of the patients were minimum 6 months and maximum 17 years. Thirty eight (77.6%) of the patients were male. There were 31 patients (63.2%) fed within the first 24 h of admission to intensive care unit and 14 (28.6%) patients fed within 24–48 h, and the number of patients with an initial enteral nutrition time over 48 h was 4 (8.2%). The reason for not being fed within the first 48 h was the requirement of an abdominal surgery after trauma.Conclusions:It is of importance to provide nutritional support in critically ill children with trauma in the intensive care unit, as in other patient groups. If there is no contraindication in terms of nutrition, patients should be fed as early as possible, the enteral route should be preferred, and the sufficiency of the calories given should be frequently evaluated.ReferenceSachdev G et al.

Primary endpoint: GV (standard deviation of BG values) on intervention day (D) 3; other endpoints: insulin requirement, dysglycemic events, nutritional adequacy (ratio actual/planned calories), gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance.Results:On D3, there was a trend towards lower GV with DSF vs. SF (within patient standard deviation [SD] 18.6 ± 8.7 vs. 21.2 ± 7.7 mg/dl, pooled SD 20.4 vs. 22.9 mg/dl;p= 0.349). The number of patients with hypoglycemic events (8/13 vs. 15/15) and events per patient (2.6 ± 4.5 vs. 5.3 ± 6.7) was significantly lower in the DSF than in the SF group (p= 0.013 andp= 0.026). More SAH patients receiving DSF required insulin over time. The insulin dose tended to be higher in the DSF than in the SF group. Nutritional adequacy was app. 90% overall and higher with DSF vs. SF from D2-D5 (p= 0.036 at D3). GI tolerance was comparable between groups. Fewer patients receiving DSF experienced GI adverse events potentially related to the feeding formula (6/13 vs. 9/15,p= 0.70).Conclusions:In poor-grade hemorrhagic stroke patients, a DSF tempered GV and reduced the number of hypoglycemic events compared to a SF. The DSF was safe and well-tolerated, allowing an increased nutrition delivery while contributing to improved BG control.

It was possible but laborious to calculate and prepare feed constituents to meet patients’ daily nutritional needs, and for bedside nurses to give it. No related or unexpected serious AEs were found. AE rates for episodes of daily vomiting and high gastric residual volume (GRV; > 350mls) were similar in SF and KF arms; episodes of diarrhoea (3d in a row) were more prevalent with KF than SF (76.92% vs. 52.33%, respectively). Daily blood glucose concentration remained ≥ 3.9 mmol/l in all KF patients but was ≥ 10 mmol/l in a greater proportion of SF than KF patients (57.48% vs. 26.85%, respectively). KF was associated with mild plasma ketosis (up to 2.7 mmol/l) and a greater urinary ketosis (up to 8 mmol/l).Conclusions:Enteral KF in ICU patients is safe, tolerated and induces ketone body production.

In this context, both the quantity and quality (amino acid pattern) of protein nutrition may play a key role in supporting muscle mass preservation. Our analysis aimed to evaluate potential associations of enteral/parenteral amino acid intake with muscle mass loss during the ICU stay.Methods:Data were collected from a recent randomized controlled trial conducted in ICU patients investigating the effect of protein quantity (intervention [IG]: 1.8 g/kg body weight [BW]; standard [SG]: 1.2 g/kg BW/d) on the muscle mass loss over 28 days. Intake of individual amino acids (AA) and sum scores of indispensable, conditionally indispensable, and dispensable AA were calculated (group specific [n = 21 each] and in total [n = 42]). Inter-group differences were analyzed by t-tests; linear regression models tested the effects of individual AA and sum scores on the extent of muscle loss (significance level adjusted according to the Bonferroni procedure [α = 0.002]).Results:Intake of indispensable AA covered actual recommendations (IG: 51.1 g/d, SG: 38.5 g/d; 41% of total AA supply). Conditionally indispensable AA (glutamine, tyrosine, cysteine, histidine, and arginine) accounted for 17% (IG: 21.4 g/d) and 18% (SG: 16.6 g/d) of total AA; glutamine supply (only given enterally) reached 0.06–0.07 g/kg BW/d.

The patients were evaluated on days 1, 5, and 8.Results:The RF-CSA area decreased significantly (− 16.9%;p< 0.05) from days 1 to 8, but showed maintenance of the thickness of the anterior compartment of the quadriceps muscle (− 3.20%;p= 0.3) from days 1 to 8. These patients showed a reduction of 2.1% per day in the rectus femoris cross-sectional area and 0.3% per day in the thickness of the anterior compartment of the quadriceps muscle during 8 days. Patients showed maintenance of the echogenicity (1.3%;p= 0.8) from days 1 to 8 with an increase of 0.16% per day. All patients showed an increase in the MRC score and reduction of the ICF-muscle strength, meaning improved muscle strength from days 1 to 8 (p< 0.05).

However, little information is available about the quality of life and long-term persistent symptoms after discharge from ICU [1]. The purpose of this study is to describe the symptoms, the neurological, functional and psychological status 6 months after discharge from ICU.Methods:We performed an observational prospective monocentric study. We considered patients admitted to ICU for acute respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020 to March 2021 and discharged alive. Patients underwent a telephone interview 6 months after discharge. We asked for residual symptoms. Neurological, psychological and functional status was assessed using validated questionnaires.Results:Of the 111 eligible patients, 6 (5.4%) died after discharge and 35 (31,5%) were lost to follow-up. Demographic characteristics of the population are presented in Table1. At 6 months after discharge, 9 (12.8%) patients reported no symptoms. Dyspnoea was present in 45 (64.3%) patients, asthenia in 39 (55.7%). 32 patients (45.7%) reported memory deficit, 28 (40%) peripheral neuropathy, 17 (24.3%) artrhalgias and 6 (8.6%) dysphagia. Palpitations were present in 16 (22.8%) patients and 10 (14.3%) patients experienced insomnia or agitation. The PC-PTSD-5 was positive in 21 (30%) patients. Based on PCFS Scale,13 (18.6%) patients reported no functional limitations, 14 (20%) negligible functional limitations, 24 (34.3%) slight functional limitations, 5 (7.1%) moderate functional limitations and 14 (20%) severe functional limitations. The GOS-E score was 6 [5–8] and it was inversely correlated with the number of hypoxia episodes (Spearman rho = − 0.25, CI 95% − 0.47 to − 0.01,p= 0.03).Conclusions:At 6 months after ICU discharge, only a few patients reported no symptoms or functional limitations.

The COVID-19 pandemic increased pressure on critical care, but also increased the number of patients vulnerable to long-term effects of a critical care admission. PICS is a deterioration of physical, cognitive or mental functioning as a result of a critical illness, after hospital discharge [1]. PICS-Q is a validated 18-point screening tool to identify PICS. Each question has a value from 0 (never) to 3 (always) [2].Methods:Using PICS-Q, this was a prospective single-centre study of adult COVID-19 patients treated in level 2 or 3 care for greater than 4 days, and then suitable for follow-up at the same centre.Results:From study period there were 32 eligible patients. Postal questionnaires were sent and replies were anonymised. There were 13 replies. Individual scores were combined to give a total score for each question, allowing analysis of which symptoms were most reported by patient group, seen below. Patients suffered from the physical symptoms., such as joint stiffness and fatigue and weakness the most (cumulative scores of 21, 16 and 15 from the 13 patients). Mental symptoms such as worry and ease to anger were also highly reported (16 and 13). Cognitive symptoms were reported the least apart from struggling to concentrate (Fig.1).Conclusions:These patients represent a snapshot of those affected by COVID-19 outbreak treated in critical care. As the number of patients treated in ICU goes up, the number of patients vulnerable to suffering from PICS will mirror that, representing a further challenge to stretched health services. Further work is required to identify and treat symptoms related to PICS.Acknowledgments:Thanks to Jeong Y, Kang J, for allowing use of PICS-Q here.ReferencesNeedham DM et al.

CCI patients showed great heterogeneity. Therefore, it is important to identify the subtypes in order to guide clinical practice and trials. In this study, we used multiple machine learning methods to identified CCI phenotypes and their characteristics in disease pattern and heterogenous treatment effect.Methods:Data from three large critical care electronic healthcare record databases and one single-center tertiary referral hospital in China were extracted and formed four observational cohorts. Multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms were employed independently for phenotypes derivation and cross validation. A Bayesian-based framework was applied for treatment effect investigation.Results:In total 6862 patients were enrolled in this study. Clustering process identified four CCI phenotypes as A (mild), B (short course), C (dehydrated and catabolic multiple organ dysfunction), and D (multiple organ failure). Each phenotype showed distinct clinical features and disease behaviors (Fig.1). Survival analysis indicated that Type D has the worst prognosis (ICU mortality: 29.9%,p< 0.001) and Type A has the best prognosis (ICU mortality: 13.1%,p< 0.001). Bayesian causal inference analysis demonstrated that there were great differences in the efficacy of various therapies in different subtypes and we proposed an optimized treatment framework in order to individually improve critical care.Conclusions:We identified four novel phenotypes that revealed the different patterns within CCI patients.

Using a national helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) database, we developed an algorithm for predicting mortality in patients treated by physician-staffed HEMS units, suitable for real-life scenarios.Methods:We performed a retrospective observational register-based cohort study of patients treated by all five Finnish HEMS units between 2012 and 2019. We analyzed the relationship between 30-day mortality and physiological, patient-related, and circumstantial variables and performed derivation of the multivariable models for each combination of missing variables. Data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to select the variables for each model and pooled the results using Rubin’s rule. The models were combined into an algorithm to allow risk estimation tool that accounts for missing variables.Results:28,373 of the 36,633 patients encountered were included of whom 8,611 died before 30 days. 11 variables (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, GCS, sex, age, vehicle type, mission located in medical facility, cardiac rhythm, delay from emergency call to HEMS arrival, and dispatch code) were included. The algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.932 (95% CI, 0.929 to 0.935), Brier score of 0.091, calibration intercept of − 0.002 (95% CI, − 0.041 to 0.038), and slope of 0.996 (95% CI, 0.974 to 1.018).Conclusions:We present a novel severity of illness algorithm to be used in patients encountered by the HEMS that may aid in future quality improvement of HEMS and facilitate comparison between units.ReferencesVincent JL et al.

Optimizing care in trauma system remains a challenge. Trauma-related preventable death (TRPD) analysis is one of the means to improve the quality of care. The aim of this study was to assess the TRPD rate in our regional trauma system.Methods:Retrospective cohort study. Trauma patients with fatal outcome hospitalized in Brest university-affiliated hospital in France between 2016 et 2020 were enrolled. Preventable death was defined using the WHO definition. All cases were reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel composed by anesthesiologist, intensivist, emergency doctor, surgeons and radiologists. Primary outcome was the TRPD incidence. Secondary outcomes were the type of errors leading to death according to the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) taxonomy.Results:104 deaths due to trauma were reviewed. Death causes were mainly due to traumatic brain injury (70%), and hemorrhagic shock (20%). The TRPD incidence was 15.4% (7 preventable deaths, 9 potentially preventable deaths and 88 non-preventable deaths). Mean ISS in preventable deaths was 28, and 36 in non-preventable deaths (p= 0.062). 244 errors were identified, and 82 in preventable deaths (34%). Most errors (53%) were due to excessive delay (diagnostic or treatment) (Table1).Conclusions:Trauma-related preventable deaths occurred in 15.4% of our patients.

ARC, defined as a creatinine clearance of ≥ 130 ml/min/1.73 m2, was assessed through weekly 24-h urine collection. Univariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with ARC which were then entered as covariates in a logistic regression using a backward stepwise selection. Goodness-of-fit of the model was assessed and a receiver operator characteristic curve was generated.Results:ARC was observed in 25.3% (n = 82) of the study cohort (n = 324). Age < 50 years old (AOR 7.32; 95% CI 4.03–13.29,p< 0.001), lower serum creatinine at ICU admission (AOR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96–0.99,p< 0.001) and admission for trauma (AOR 2.26; 95% CI 1.12–4.54,p= 0.022) were identified as independent risk factors. Our model showed acceptable discrimination in predicting ARC (area under the receiver operator curve 0.810; 95% CI 0.756–0.864,p< 0.001).Conclusions:Age < 50 years old, lower serum creatinine upon ICU admission and trauma were identified as independent risk factors for ARC.

However, SCr is reported to have low sensitivity for detecting renal dysfunction in critical illness. Population based equations such as C&G CrCl have not been validated in acute kidney injury (AKI), secondary to induced pathophysiological changes. Direct measurement of CrCl is advocated such as 4–8 h urine creatinine clearance (UrCrCl) [1]. In this retrospective analysis we describe the variation in estimated GFR (eGFR) from results of C&G CrCl, CKD-EPI eGFR and measured UrCrCl.Methods:Retrospective data collection and case note review from electronic health records (Phillips ICCA® and iSOFT Clinical Manager®) was completed from Dec 2018 to Nov 2021, for adult critical care patients admitted to Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust who had a measured UrCrCl. The aims were to compare results and to assess the impact on drug dosing.Results:In 28/31 (90.3%) patients, C&G CrCl was an over-estimation of renal function, with a median difference between C&G CrCl and measured UrCrCl of 239%.

UrCrCl is useful in patients in whom serum creatinine results may be confounded by extremes of age, frailty, low muscle mass and fluctuations in fluid balance.

We investigated the association between kidney stress during early critical illness and kidney function at ICU discharge.Methods:Participants were all inpatients at a critical care unit, UK. Those who died in ICU were excluded. TIMP-2∙IGFBP7 was measured on day 1, 3, 5, and 7, peak measurement in first 7 days was categorised as: Low risk (< 0.3), Low-Medium Risk (0.3–0.99), High-Medium Risk (1–2) or High Risk (2 +). eGFR at ICU discharge was assessed using creatinine and cystatin C. Differences in eGFR between groups were assessed using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test.Results:We included 35 patients, median age 54 yrs (range 21–76). Median ICU stay was 16 days (range 5–54). Median baseline eGFR-Cr was 96 ml/min/1.73 m2(range 16–121). 13 patients developed creatinine defined AKI in the first 10 days with 7 receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Distribution of peak TIMP-2∙IGFBP7 within the first 7 days was: Low risk (N 3), Low-Medium Risk (N 11), High-Medium Risk (N 11), High Risk (N 10). Cystatin C eGFR at ICU discharge was lower than creatinine eGFR (70 vs 108 ml/min/1.73m2,p< 0.001). No patient remained on KRT at ICU discharge. Peak TIMP-2∙IGFBP7 category correlated with ICU discharge cystatin C eGFR (p= 0.0128) but not creatinine eGFR (p= 0.166) (Fig.1).Conclusions:In critical illness assessment of kidney function is impeded by falls in creatinine generation. Here kidney stress was detected in 86% of cases whereas creatinine defined AKI was observed in 40%. When kidney function was assessed using cystatin C, severity of early kidney stress identified worse kidney function at ICU discharge. TIMP-2∙IGFBP7 may help risk-stratify long term renal function following critical illness. Evaluation of kidney biomarker tests should consider using cystatin C rather than creatinine to assess kidney outcomes.Fig. 1 (abstract P135)Whisker and Boxplot"

Better knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics will help improve the prevention and management of this disease.Methods:Prospective descriptive study carried out in the emergency department of the Taher Sfar CHU in Mahdia between March 1 and August 31, 2021. Patients older than 18 years with acute renal impairment were included. Chronic renal insufficiency with hemodialysis stage was excluded as well as renal insufficiency having kept stable creatinine figures. The main objective of this work was to study the epidemiological profile of AKI within patients hospitalized in the emergency department.Results:Our study englobed 103 patients: 53 men and 50 women, with a sex ratio of 1.06. The average age was 66 years. 94% of the patients included had a medical history of: diabetes 58.7% and HTA 54.4%, chronic renal failure was reported in 33%. Thus, most of the cases were under disease-modifying treatment: 64% under diuretics. The COVID attack affected 42% of hospitalized patients. Sepsis was the most common cause of AKI in the emergency room 38.8% of patients, followed by functional AKI(33,9%), 4 patients presented with obstructive AKI requiring placement of a JJ catheter. Patients were classified according to the KDIGO classification: stage I (n = 58) stage II (n = 8) stage (n = 37). Urgent hemodialysis was indicated in the presence of uremic syndrome (14.6%) in 23% of cases, otherwise vascular filling was indicated in 60 patients (58.3%). 64 patients were hospitalized in our emergency room (65%), 15 patients died (14.6%). Full recovery was observed in 18.4% of patients, 29.1% of patients partially recovered while 13.6% were dependent on long-term dialysis.Conclusions:Acute kidney injury is one of the most common serious complications for all hospital admissions.

CCL14 was measured with the NEPHROCLEAR™ CCL14 Test (Astute Medical). Primary endpoint was persistent severe AKI (PS-AKI), defined as 72 h of stage 3 AKI, or death or receipt of dialysis prior to 72 h. We stratified the CCL14 concentrations into three levels: Low (≤ 1.3 ng/ml), Medium (> 1.3 to ≤ 13 ng/ml), and High (> 13 ng/ml) based on previously determined clinical risk cut-offs and grouped patients by CCL14 levels across 3 samples.Results:We included 417 patients (median 65 yr) with 3 consecutive CCL14 measurements, 75 developed PS-AKI. Initial CCL4 levels were low in 196 (47%), medium in 180 (43%) and high in 41 (9.8%). In 66% of cases CCL14 category was unchanged from first to last timepoint. 158/196 patients with initially low levels of CCL14 remained in this category and had the lowest risk of developing PS-AKI, while patients with High CCL14 at any time had the highest risk. Patients with CCL14 levels in the mid-range (> 1.3 to ≤ 13 ng/ml) had intermediate risk and the risk increased with number of medium CCL14 results (Fig.1).Conclusions:In two-thirds of patients CCL14 levels were stable over 24 h.

However, the impact of each individual component of this bundle was unclear and was therefore investigated in this analysis.Methods:Data of the two PrevAKI-trials were combined, together including 554 cardiac surgery patients at high risk for AKI, as identified by elevated urinary biomarkers TIMP-2∙IGFBP7 [1, 2]. Patients were randomized to standard of care versus implementation of the care bundle. Univariate logistic regression of the bundle’s components was performed as a risk factor analysis of the whole cohort. Following this, individual treatment effects were analyzed, using the same method for the intervention group only.Results:Hypotension, low cardiac index, and use of radiocontrast agents significantly increased the risk for AKI. Similarly, optimizing the hemodynamic situation (i.e. avoiding hypotension or a low cardiac output state) was the most important individual component for the prevention of AKI. However, this was not the case for avoidance of radiocontrast. Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs was identified as an important component in the individual treatment effect analysis, however this finding showed wide confidence intervals (Table1).Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining adequate systemic blood pressure and cardiac output. If hypotension or low cardiac index occurs, timely hemodynamic optimization should be performed to prevent AKI. Whilst our analyses suggested a possible role for radiocontrast agents and nephrotoxic drugs, these factors had wide confidence intervals, indicating low certainty of these findings. Besides hemodynamic optimization, other bundle components had little or no impact on the bundle’s overall effectiveness.ReferencesMeersch M et al.

Four hours after surgery, patients at high risk for AKI were identified by the urinary biomarkers TIMP-2∙IGFBP7. Hemodynamics were then analyzed for the consecutive 12 h. In the combined dataset, the incidence and severity of AKI were compared between patients with postoperative hypotension and/or low cardiac index versus patients with hemodynamic stability. Thereafter, the incidence of AKI was evaluated for different hemodynamic thresholds of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac index (CI).Results:AKI occurred significantly more frequently in patients with postoperative hypotension and/or low cardiac index compared to patients with hemodynamic stability (57.1% vs. 37,2%,p< 0.05). This effect was especially marked for more severe stages of AKI (29.8% vs. 9,3%,p< 0.01). Our analyses demonstrated an almost constant increase in the rate of postoperative AKI with lower MAP and CI thresholds. A prominent threshold for increase in AKI rates was found at a mean MAP of between 70 mmHg or 75 mmHg and a cardiac index lower than 3.0 l/min/m2(Table1).Conclusions:Postoperative hypotension and low cardiac output are key risk factors for AKI in the ICU. For cardiac surgery patients at high risk for AKI, a higher target mean arterial pressure than the generally recommended 65 mmHg may be beneficial to prevent AKI, although this needs to be balanced against the potential side effects of required treatment intensity. Finally, our analyses strongly underline the importance of low cardiac output in the immediate postoperative period as a risk factor for kidney injury.ReferencesMeersch M et al.

Through biofeedback, angiotensin-II (AT-II) may potentially attenuate hyperreninemia, whilst maintaining target mean arterial blood pressure (MAP > 65 mmHg). This trial assesses the association between administration of AT-II and plasma renin levels in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative vasoplegia and hyperreninemia.Methods:A cohort of 40 patients after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and high D-renin levels (baseline vs. 4 h after CPB, cut-off > 3.7 µU/ml, [1]) received vasopressor therapy with either norepinephrine (NE) and AT-II or standalone NE. The primary outcome was the renin plasma level at 12 h after surgery, adjusted by baseline renin plasma level at 4 h after surgery.Results:Overall, the median renin plasma concentration increased from a median baseline (quartiles) of 44.3 µU/ml (14.6, 155.5) to 188.6 µU/ml (29.8, 379.0) 4 h after CPB. Patients with high D-renin were then treated with either NE alone [median (quartiles) dose of 3.25 mg (1.00, 4.75)] or with NE with additional AT-II [NE dose: 1.33 mg (0.78, 2.04)]; [AT-II dose: 0.34 mg (0.29, 0.78)]. At 12 h after surgery, renin levels were lower in patients who received AT-II, compared to patients that did not receive AT-II: 71.7 µU/ml (21.9, 211.4) vs. 130.6µU/ml (62.9, 317.0;p= 0.034 adjusted for baseline renin plasma level at 4 h after surgery). AT-II effects on renin levels were particularly pronounced in patients without ACEi or ARB premedication. Finally, AT-II significantly decreased the dose of NE required to maintain the target MAP (Table1).Conclusions:In cardiac surgery patients with post-OP vasoplegia and high D-renin levels, AT-II reduced renin plasma levels at 12 h compared to NE alone, which was associated with increased renin levels. Furthermore, AT-II significantly decreased the NE dose required to maintain target MAP.ReferenceKüllmar M et al.

The aim of the study is to show the effects of RBC transfusion on renal blood flow, as detected by renal resistivity index (RRI) and renal venous stasis index (RVSI). Moreover, we hypothesized that RBC transfusion could be more significant in patients with higher oxygen extraction rate (O2ER).Methods:Critically ill patients who experienced Hb levels between 7 and 9 g/dl were included in the study. RBC transfusion was decided by physician; in non-transfused patients an equivalent volume of crystalloids (i.e., 250 ml) were given. The peak systolic velocity (Vmax) and the minimal diastolic velocity (Vmin) were determined from an interlobar or arcuate artery using a posterolateral approach for kidney ultrasound. The RRI was calculated as (Vmax–Vmin)/Vmax and RVSI was calculated as (cardiac cycle time/venous flow time)/cardiac cycle time. RRI and RVSI were calculated before intervention (T1) and 2 h after intervention (T2) from both kidney and the worst values were used for analysis.Results:Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study. Hb was 8.6 [8–8.7] g/dl and SOFA was 8.5 [5–10]: twelve (55%) were transfused and ten (45%) were not. Median RRI was 0.70 [0.65–0.75] at T1and 0.68 [0.66–0.70] at T2(p= 0.39), while median RSVI was 100 [85–100] at T1and 100 [94–100] at T2. From T1to T2only transfused patients lowered their RRI, from 0.71 [0.66–0.76] to 0.68 [0.66–0.70],p= 0.38; in the mixed model analysis RBC transfusion was significantly associated with RRI reduction (p= 0.47). RSVI did not changed after intervention in both groups. The size of the RBCT effect on RRI was magnified in patients with higher O2ER (p= 0.01 for interaction) (Fig.1). AKI occurred in 3/12 transfused patients and 3/10 in non-transfused.Conclusions:In patients with moderate anemia RBCT is associated with increased renal blood flow, as detected by RRI. This is particularly evident in patients with higher O2ER.Fig. 1 (abstract P141)Renal resistivity Index before and after study intervention.

We used data from the AKIKI [2] and IDEAL-ICU [3] randomised controlled trials to develop a multivariable logistic regression model for RRT initiation within 48 h after allocation to a delayed strategy. We then used an interaction with spline terms in a Cox model to estimate treatment effects across the predicted risks of RRT initiation.Results:We analysed data from 1,107 patients (619 and 488 in the AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU trial respectively). In the pooled sample, we found evidence for heterogenous treatment effects (p= 0·023). Patients at an intermediate-high risk of RRT initiation within 48 h may have benefited from an early strategy (absolute risk difference, − 14%; 95% CI, − 27% to − 1%). For other patients, we found no evidence of benefit from an early strategy of RRT initiation but a trend for harm (absolute risk difference, 8%; 95% CI, − 5% to 21% in patients at intermediate-low risk) (Fig.1).Conclusions:We have identified a clinically sound heterogeneity of treatment effect of an early vs a delayed strategy of RRT initiation that may reflect varying degrees of kidney demand-capacity mismatch.ReferencesKent DR et al.

For this analysis, all the patients enrolled until August 31, 2020, were assessed for eligibility. It comprised patients for whom a complete data set for blood gas parameters including pH, serum bicarbonate, pCO2 and base excess was documented at hospital admission, immediately before (baseline) and immediately after the first ADVOS session, and after the last ADVOS session. Patients with baseline blood pH ≥ 7.35 were classified as having “no acidemia”, while patients with pH < 7.35 were subclassified into different types of acidosis.Results:240 out of 282 patients from 5 study sites in Germany were eligible. 123 had no acidemia, while 119 were subdivided into having metabolic acidosis (34), respiratory acidosis (17), mixed acidosis (62) or compensated acidemia (6). A total of 971 ADVOS treatment sessions were documented with a median of 3 (IQR: 2, 5) sessions per patient. The median duration of the ADVOS sessions was 19 h (IQR: 12, 23). Median blood flow rate was 100 ml/min (IQR: 100,150) and median dialysate pH was 7.8 (IQR: 7.4–8.4).

Frequent filter changes can lead to reduced therapy delivery, increased cost and anaemia, however, the benefits of preserving filter lifespan must be balanced against the risks of anticoagulation associated bleeding.Methods:A retrospective observational study was performed of our COVID-19 patients requiring RRT using an increased citrate presciption of 4 mmol/l and continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF).Results:The unit treated 106 patients with COVID 19 of whom 15 required RRT. 8 patients were managed exclusively on the adjusted protocol. The median duration spent on RRT was 188 h. The average lifespan of a filter in COVID-19 patient was improved from 37 to 45 h using the increased citrate protocol. There were no adverse bleeding outcomes and no documented evidence of citrate toxicity.Conclusions:This small study showed an improved filter life for patients on an increased citrate dose protocol of CVVHDF without any adverse outcomes. This results in cost savings and more appropriate resource usage during a pandemic without increased bleeding risk. Another suggested measure to reduce filter malfunctions was that centres returned to using heparin anticoagulation but this is known to have increased bleeding risk [2]. Further research in a larger cohort is required but this is a promising improvement in a complex patient group.ReferencesArgenziano MG et al. Br Med J 369:m1996, 2020Bai M et al.

The development of AKI in the first days after LT is associated with increased mortality in the lung transplant recipients. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between the volume of infused fluids, the balances of crystalloids and colloids during LT surgery and in the first 24 h and the eGFR values in the following days of the postoperative period.Methods:Retrospective data analysis of 73 patients undergoing lung transplantation in 2015–2018 in our institution.

Minimizing FB volume can decrease the hemodilution effects but also the cardiac index (CI) elevations. The study aimed to assess the DO2changes after FB of different technics. We speculated that FB effects on DO2are not inferior when a limited crystalloid fluid volume is given within a short period than larger volumes of crystalloids or colloids given at longer periods.Methods:This prospective observational study was conducted in critically ill adult patients without active bleeding and venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide tension (PvaCO2> 6 mmHg) treated with FB. Arterial blood gas samples were taken, and CI was measured through transthoracic echocardiogram before and after FB. The primary endpoint was the DO2changes after FB, and the secondary endpoint was Hb changes.Results:Sixty patients were enrolled with PvaCO28.5 mmHg (IQR:7.5 to 10.2). Twenty-five patients received FB with colloids (7 ml/kg (IQR: 6.25 to 7.6)) within 30 min (IQR:28 to 39), 14 patients received FB with crystalloids (16 ml/kg (IQR: 11 to 20)) within 40 min (IQR: 28 to 40) and 21 patients crystalloids (4 ml/kg (IQR: 3.6 to 4.6)) within 20 min (infusion pump) (p< 0.01). FB with crystalloids 4 ml/kg increased DO29% (IQR: − 1 to 19) compared to -2% (IQR: − 9 to 16) and 5% (IQR: − 8 to 14) in patients who received FB with higher volumes of crystalloids and colloids, respectively (p= 0.15) (Fig.1). FB with crystalloids 4 ml/kg resulted to a decrease in Hb − 3% (IQR: − 6 to − 1) compared to − 7% (IQR: − 11 to − 4) and -8% (IQR: − 11 to − 5) in patients who received FB with higher volumes of crystalloids and colloids, respectively (p< 0.01).Conclusions:Fluid bolus with a limited volume of crystalloids given within 20 min has no inferior effects on oxygen delivery and has significantly lower hemodilution effects.Fig. 1 (abstract P148)ResultsP149Efficacy and safety of TrachFlush artificial cough maneuver for fluid removal in simulated breathingDS Karbing1, A Zanella2, SE Rees11Aalborg University, Department of Health Science and Technology, Respiratory and Critical Care Group, Aalborg, Denmark,2Universitá degli Studi di Milano,"

TrachFlush (AW Technologies) applies a method for secretion removal by Zanella et al. [1] by artificial coughs (ACs) implemented by rapid ETT cuff deflation/inflation during inspiration. Peak airway flow (Qpeak) ≥ 60 l/min is necessary to displace secretion [2]. Zanella et al. showed at peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30–40 cmH2O AC Qpeak≥ 60 l/min and safe fluid removal with no aspiration. This study evaluated TrachFlush performance at PIP of 20–40 cmH2O.Methods:Nine scenarios were simulated with 3 PIP (20, 30 and 40 cmH2O) and 3 lung conditions (healthy, low compliance (CRS) and high resistance (RAW)). An artificial lung (QuickLung Breather, IngMar Medical) was ventilated in pressure control (PC) (RR = 7 min−1, I:E = 1:2, PEEP = 5 cmH2O) via a Ø = 7.5 mm ETT in an artificial trachea (25 cm, Ø = 19 mm PVC tube) with resistance 3.7 cmH2O/l/s at 60L/min. Qpeakwas measured with the trachea horizontal during 5 ACs. We analysed the middle 3 ACs. Fluid removal and aspiration at PIP 20 and 30 cmH2O were visually assessed over 3 ACs, with trachea horizontal and 2 mL dyed saline injected between ETT cuff and lung or trachea at 45° and 2 mL saline injected above cuff, respectively.Results:The Figure shows effect of PIP and lung condition (CRSand RAWin cmH2O and l/cmH2O/s) on Qpeakand AC time with Q ≥ 60 l/min.

The saline was fully removed in all scenarios, and no fluid aspiration was observed in any of the scenarios (Fig.1).Conclusions:The TrachFlush AC produced sustained and sufficient Qpeakfor secretion removal and removed saline and avoided aspiration in all simulated scenarios.ReferencesZanella A et al.

The AC is produced by rapid cuff deflation/inflation during inspiration. At respiratory rate (RR) of 7 1/min and Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30–40 cmH2O the original method was shown effective [3]. This study evaluated the feasibility of using bedside selected or similar PIP and RR for AC.Methods:Patients were ≥ 18 years, orally intubated and ventilated in pressure control (PC) or pressure support (PS). In each patient, on clinical indication for ETS, 1–3 procedures each with 3 ACs were performed at PIP and RR as close to bedside settings as possible, allowing 1 s inspiratory time (VENTlow). If ETS remained indicated, three ACs were performed at increased PIP and decreased RR (VENThigh).Results:Preliminary results from 18 procedures in 8 patients.

The aim was to determine major adverse events related to tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients: severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.Methods:This is a prospective, observational, dual-center study of COVID-19 patients undergoing advanced airway management for respiratory failure and admitted in ICU from November 2020 to May 2021. We reported data about demographics, comorbidities and parameters related to the intubation and expertise. Within 30 min from the intubation, we recorded the occurrence of severe hypoxia, cardiac arrest, hemodynamic instability. We collected data about difficult airways, the need of front of neck airways position, death within 30 min from the intubation, arrhythmia, esophageal intubation, pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax recognized within 6 h from the intubation.Results:Within 142 patients considered for our analysis, 73.94% experienced at least 1 major adverse peri-intubation event.

Large scale studies such as RECOVERY-RS [1] compared HFNO and CPAP to conventional oxygen therapy in patients suitable for mechanical ventilation. TSDFT had capacity to offer ward based HFNO/CPAP to patients deemed both suitable and not suitable for mechanical ventilation. We set out to review the outcomes of all patients who received HFNO/CPAP for COVID-19 pneumonitis at our trust.Methods:A retrospective observational study of all patients with COVID-19 Pneumonitis who received CPAP/HFNO was conducted at a district general hospital in South West England. Electronic records and ICD10 diagnostic codes were reviewed between September 2020 and October 2021.Results:90 patients received HFNO or CPAP. The median age was 68 years. 50 (55%) survived to hospital discharge. Survival to hospital discharge was greater in females (71%) than males (42%). Survival decreased from 100% in the 21–30 years age group, to 33.3% in the > 70 years age group. On review of co-morbidities the overall survival rate was similar, except for patients with cardiac failure or valvular disease, of which only 4 of 19 patients survived (21%) All patients under 40 years survived to hospital discharge. There was no relationship between number of days of therapy and survival to discharge.Conclusions:Among this cohort, survival to hospital discharge after HFNO or CPAP for COVID-19 Pneumonitis was greater in younger patients, females and those without cardiovascular failure.ReferencePerkins GD et al. medRxiv 2021.08.02.212613792021P155Non-invasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients, the experience of a level 2 unitJ Rua1, AR Nogueira2, JE Mateus1, AF Costa3, A Ribeiro4, C Silva5, J Trêpa61Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Coimbra, Portugal,2Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Medicina Intensiva, Coimbra, Portugal,3Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço de Pneumologia, Coimbra, Portugal,4Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço de Hematologia Clínica, Coimbra, Portugal,5Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço de Medicina Interna, Coimbra, Portugal,6Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço de Doenças Infecciosas, Coimbra, PortugalCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P155Introduction:COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of severity and, although the majority of those infected are asymptomatic or have mild disease, many need hospitalization and organ support for respiratory failure.

After initial unfavorable data, NIV resumed prominence during the 2nd wave, having been the modality of choice in our intermediate care unit (IU). We describe our NIV cohort and the results of our ventilatory strategy.Methods:Descriptive retrospective study. Data were collected from electronic medical records of 202 COVID-19 patients (PTS) under NIV at the IU between September/20 and March/21. Categorical data are presented as frequency (percentage) and were compared using χ2 -test. Continuous variables were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.Results:202 of 469 PTS were submitted to NIV. Mean age was 66 years and 62.8% were male. Most common comorbidities were hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and diabetes. Mean admission SOFA score was 3.6. Most PTS underwent corticosteroid therapy, 86.7% in > 1 mg/kg dosage equivalent. Remdesivir was used in 50%. In 88.6% NIV was the initial modality of ventilatory support, 11.4% after HFNC failure (23). The preferred mode was CPAP with mean maximum pressure of 13 (6–16), titrated to normalization of the work of breathing (WOB). Mean PaO2/FiO2ratio at start of NIV was 122, < 100 in 43% of PTS. NIV failure occurred in 35.6%, intra-unit mortality was 25.6%. 35 PTS were submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 41% died. Advanced age, intolerance to awake prone and delirium were associated with higher mortality.Conclusions:NIV is a valid option for the management of respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 ARDS, reducing the need for IMV.

Decisions around timing of intubation and invasive ventilation remain a challenge. NEWS2 is a well-established physiology scoring system used to detect the deteriorating patient [1]. New evidence suggests ROX index may be more reliable than NEWS2 to identify patients at risk of treatment failure of non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) [2]. Another study has suggested the use of a nomogram for predicting NIRS failure [3].Methods:Data were collected retrospectively from 81 COVID-19 patients admitted to a general critical care unit. Vasopressor use, comorbidities and worst physiological parameters in the first 24 h of instituting NIRS were recorded and used to calculate NEWS2, ROX index, nomogram scores and P/F ratio. NIRS failure, length of therapy and survival status at the end of critical care admission were recorded.Results:Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were calculated for NIRS failure prediction. For nomogram AUROC was 0.701 (95% CI 0.584–0.818)p= 0.0033, ROX index AUROC 0.810 (95% CI 0.708–0.908)p= < 0.0001, NEWS2 AUROC 0.688 (95 CI 0.574–0.802)p= 0.0051, P/F AUROC 0.748 (95% CI 0.638–0.858).Conclusions:ROX index is an easily calculated score and a better predictor of NIRS failure than nomogram, NEWS2 scores and P/F ratio. NEWS2 is not calibrated for this patient population and is not specific for those requiring respiratory support.

It is used together with a ventilator to treat acute respiratory failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which is responsible for COVID-19 pandemic, caused a massive influx of patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study aims to improved percentage of oxygenation of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure using nitric oxide therapy by more than 50% by the end of 2021.Methods:The data were collected using ISBAR (Introduction—Situation—Background—Assessment—Recommendation) hand over tool and arterial blood gas results from RAPIDCOMM blood gas server from the months of May 2021 to October 2021. Data collected includes date of intubation and extubation, start date and end date of iNO treatment, blood gases measurements before, during and after iNO treatment, dose of inhaled nitric oxide in PPM (parts per million), total number of days in iNO therapy.Results:Based on the patients data collected from May to October 2021, 91–95% of COVID-19 patients who were treated with iNO in the months of May, June, July showed improvement in oxygenation and were wean-off from ventilator (Fig.1). During the month of August 2021, influx of ARDS due to COVID-19 became twice as much the number compared from the previous months and it was observed during the months of August and September 2021. Number of patients without improvement in oxygenation has increased due to several factors such as availability of nitric oxide (NO) machine and co-morbidities like chronic renal failure.Conclusions:Our data indicates that the utilization of iNO is useful in improving arterial oxygenation of COVID-19 patients and could provide immediate help and delay of respiratory deterioration and further complications.Fig. 1 (abstract P159)ResultsP160High flow nasal oxygen in the intensive care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic at Mater Dei Hospital, MaltaC Mizzi, M Drake, S Sciberras, M ButtigiegMater Dei Hospital, Intensive Care, Msida, MaltaCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P160Introduction:The aim of this study was to describe the use of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients [1] locally, and establish their demographics and outcomes.

Data collected included use of HFNO, mechanical ventilation (MV), duration of MV, length of stay, and 28-day survival.Results:240 COVID-19 ICU patients were included. 108 (45%) received HFNO for a median of 3 days, the rest received MV for a median of 12 days. No major differences in demographics were noted (age: 66.5 vs 68 years,p= 0.225; 70% male, 30% female vs 79% male, 21% female,p= 0.191). Forty-two (38.2%) patients failed HFNO after a median of 2 days, needing MV for a median of 10 days (p< 0.001). Median length of stay was lower in HFNO patients (6 vs 13 days;p< 0.001). 28-day survival was highest in the HFNO-only group (94%), followed by the HFNO + MV group (61%), and finally the MV-only group (52%;p< 0.0001). This is not simply due to severity since FiO2was higher for HFNO patients and PaO2tended to be lower. Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that respiratory support was more significant than admission P/F ratios, PaO2s, or SOFA, with MV being linked to a hazards ratio of 8.4 (p< 0.001) when adjusted for the above criteria.Conclusions:HFNO offers considerable practical advantages over MV. Avoiding MV might be linked to a reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonias, shorter ICU stay and lower mortality. It is also a safe tool to use and the risk of aerosolization should not deter from its use.ReferenceMellado-Artigas R et al.

Patients who received post-extubation CPAP were excluded. We collected data about CPAP duration prior intubation, hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality.Results:A total of 193 COVID-19 patients received intubation after CPAP failure during the first (n = 127) and the second (n = 66) wave. During the second wave, CPAP treatment was longer (4 (2–8) vs. 3 (2–5) days;p< 0.05) as well as hospital length of stay (20 (15–29) vs. 12 (6–30) days;p< 0.05) with an increased in-hospital mortality (62% vs. 35%;p< 0.001). The univariable analysis showed that CPAP duration was a risk factor for mortality in patients failing CPAP during the second wave and in the overall population [HR 1.080 (95% C.I. 1.007–1.159) and HR 1.071 (95% C.I. 1.032–1.112), respectively.

Many patients require prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy [1]. There is no standard recommendation about the optimal timing for the procedure [2,3]. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients who underwent early versus late tracheostomy.Methods:A retrospective single-center observational descriptive study was performed at a fourth level hospital on patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and admission to the ICU who required mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy between January and July of 2021. Group analysis by the timing of tracheostomy since the start of mechanical ventilation was done in two sets: until day 14 (group 1) and from day 15 onward (group 2).

It mainly affects the respiratory tract and may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires management through orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation which, in many cases, requires performing a tracheostomy during the patient’s stay in the Intensive Care Unit.

However, they expose the patient to hemodynamic instability and their beneficial effects are debatable. Lateral positioning does not require the application of higher airway pressures and could promote alveolar recruitment due to changes in regional transpulmonary pressure.Methods:Six pigs were submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia. A lung injury model was produced by sequentially applying lung lavage followed by injurious ventilation to obtain a PF ratio < 100 mmHg. After injury, a RM was performed and open-lung-PEEP (lowest PEEP with collapse < 1%) was chosen during a decremental PEEP titration guided by EIT. After observing massive collapse at PEEp= 5 cmH2O, animals were ventilated with VT = 6 ml/kg, RR 25 bpm and optimal PEEP without recruitment maneuver. All animals were sequentially positioned at (1) supine position, (2) tilted to the left (down), (3) back to supine, (4) tilted to right (down) during 20 min, and finally back to (5) supine. We evaluated the end expiratory lung impedance (EELZ), arterial blood gases, and respiratory mechanics. Paired T tests were performed to compare the first supine with the last supine position.Results:all animals presented an increase in respiratory compliance (p= 0.008; Fig.1A) and PaO2/FiO2ratio (p= 0.009; Fig.1C). In five of six animals EELZ increased (p= 0.07), while one animal lost aeration probably due to insufficient PEEP (Fig.1B). The amount of mass of collapsed lung measured by EIT decreased after the lateral positioning (p= 0.02; Fig.1D).

Lateral positioning changes the distribution of forces within the lung, increasing the transpulmonary pressures of the lung repositioned upwards, potentially working as a RM for this upper lung. By alternating this procedure between both lungs, we could promote bilateral recruitment without the need of high airway pressures.Methods:We enrolled six animals with lung injury and mechanically ventilated. The open-lung-PEEP level was chosen by decremental PEEP titration guided by EIT (lowest PEEP generating < 3% collapse). After promoting massive lung collapse at low PEEP (5 cmH2O), all animals were kept in supine position, with PEEP slowly raised up to open-lung-PEEP without RM. Keeping the same PEEP, they were tilted to left lung down, back to supine, tilted to right lung down, and back to supine, 20 min in each position. Four of the six animals repeated the same sequence at a lower PEEP (6 cmH2O lower than open-lung PEEP). P/F ratio were measured at the end of each 20-min period and lung volume (EELZ) was continuously recorded by EIT.Results:Sequential lateral turns at open-lung PEEP resulted in significant improvements in P/F ratio (mmHg) (p< 0.05; Fig.1A) and EELZ (p= 0.07; Fig.1B). In contrast sequential lateral turns at lower PEEP did not increase P/F ratio (mmHg) (p> 0.05; Fig.1C). and resulted in decreased EELZ after each step of the lateralization (p= 0.04; Fig.1D).Conclusions:Sequential turns of lateral position can work as a traditional recruitment maneuver, resulting in better oxygenation and lung aeration, and not causing any deleterious hemodynamic effect.

Using inconsistent criteria, researchers define hyperinflammation as a form of very severe inflammation with cytokine storm. Our paper gives a novel definition. Subsequently, we describe the treatment of ICU-patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO and/or mechanical ventilation.Methods:We searched scientific articles on P2X7 purinergic receptors (P2X7Rs) to underpin our definition of hyperinflammation. We found that lidocaine can block P2X7Rs. The issue is that the half-maximal effective concentration of lidocaine for P2X7R inhibition is much higher than the maximal tolerable plasma concentration. To overcome this, we selectively inhibit the P2X7Rs of the cells of the lymph nodes. We do this by subdermal infusion of lidocaine HCL inducing clonal expansion of Tregs in local lymph nodes. Secondarily, these Tregs migrate throughout the body suppressing systemic hyperinflammation (Fig.1). We treated six COVID-19 ICU-patients with subdermal lidocaine infusion (1 mg/kg/h).Results:We found 437 articles to underpin our definition of hyperinflammation. The essence is that hyperinflammation is initiated when SARS-CoV-2 infection causes prolonged and vigorous activation of the P2X7Rs of the immune cells. This leads to cytokine storm and desensitisation of purinergic receptors of immune cells other than the P2X7Rs, resulting in immune paralysis with secondary infections. The six ICU-patients with COVID-19 we treated with lidocaine all recovered completely.Conclusions:Applying consistent criteria, we defined hyperinflammation as prolonged and vigorous activation of P2X7Rs of the immune cells and established that selective inhibition of these receptors can calm down cytokine storm in COVID-19.

We postulate that selective inhibition of the P2X7Rs of the immune cells of the lymphatic system by lidocaine suppresses hyperinflammation in two stages. Stage 1: The selective inhibition of the P2X7Rs of the immune cells residing in the lymph nodes (stage 1a) induces clonal expansion of Tregs with improved function in these lymph nodes (stage 1b); Stage 2: Subsequently, these Tregs migrate throughout the body exerting anti-inflammatory activities reducing systemic and (distant) local hyperinflammation.Source: Hasan D, et al.

There is limited knowledge of the correlation between Edi, the pressure generated during inspiration (ΔPes) and the ultrasonographic extent of its thickening (TFdi). The main aim of the current study was to assess the correlation between Edi, ΔPes and TFdi.Methods:Patients > 18 years were enrolled if they were undergoing weaning in NAVA and with a catheter for ΔPes measurement. A stepwise NAVA level reduction was performed (-25%, -50%, -75% from baseline). During each step, an arterial sample was taken for gas analysis, neuroventilatory coupling parameters were recorded and respiratory muscle ultrasound was performed. Comparison of data was performed with one- or two-way ANOVA and linear mixed models were built to assess the relationship between variables. Two-tailed,p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:We enrolled 16 patients (10 males, age 64 ± 17 years, BMI 24 ± 5 kg/m2), after an average of 8 ± 3 days from ICU admission. At enrolment, the PaO2/FIO2ratio was 300 ± 91 mmHg, patients were ventilated with PEEP 7.7 ± 2.2 cmH2O and FIO20.35 ± 0.1. Baseline NAVA level was 1.1 ± 0.7 cmH2O/uV, and Edi was 12.3 ± 8.5 uV. We found a significant correlation between Edi and ΔPes (R2= 0.32,p< 0.001), while no significant correlation was found between Edi and TFdi (R2= 0.01,p= 0.105). After analysis of individual patient data, we found two different behaviours of the Edi-TFdi relationship: a group in which the two variables were linearly correlated (preserved coupling), and one in which such coupling was not preserved (Fig.1). A higher rapid shallow breathing index, a higher Edi, a lower respiratory system compliance, and a lower neuroventilatory and neuromechanical efficiency were found in patients with non-preserved coupling.Conclusions:Edi is not always associated with TFdi; several physiological parameters were associated with the presence of a preserved or non-preserved coupling.Fig. 1 (abstract P172)Correlation between the Edi and the esophageal pressure swing (upper left), the diaphragm thickening fraction (upper right) and relationship in patients with preserved (lower left) and non-preserved (lower right) couplingP173Diaphragmatic function and weaning failure from mechanical ventilation (MV): study using ultrasound (US) technique.F Righetti1, E Colombaroli21Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Department, Fracastoro Hospital, Emergency Department, San Bonifacio, Verona, Italy,2Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Department, Fracastoro Hospital, San Bonifacio, Verona, ItalyCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P173Introduction:The complex of dysfunctional effects induced by MV on the diaphragm is called Ventilator Induced Diaphragm Dysfunction(VIDD) [1].

In all, DE was evaluated by viewing the right hemi-diaphragm using a 10 MHz linear probe in the right intercostal area. The US examination was performed at the same time as blood gas sampling and the measurement of ventilatory parameters. After 12 h of PSV, the patients started spontaneously breathe. If they were able to maintain spontaneous ventilation for the next 12 h, they were assigned to the successful weaning group (SW) otherwise to the failed weaning group (FW). The product between DE and respiratory rate, the DER, was calculated for each patient. Using the Mann–Whitney U test, the DER parameter was compared between SW and FW groups and in the subgroups of overweight/obese patients (p= 0.05).Results:57 patients are in SW group and 48 patients in FW group. There are not statistically differences in age, sex and weight class. The mean DER in SW group was 28.5 ± 27.7 cm; in FW group was 15.2 ± 8.6 cm; this difference is statistically significant (p= 0.028). Comparing the subpopulations of overweight and obese patients, the mean DER is 32.47 ± 3.2 cm in the SW, while in the FW is 13.9 ± 7.4 cm, with a statistically significant difference (p= 0.012).Conclusions:Patients who were successfully weaned from MV had higher DER values during the weaning trial. These results allow us to hypothesize the use of DER as a predictive index of weaning from MV.ReferencePeñuelas O et al.

We have previously shown that temporary transvenous diaphragm neurostimulation (TTDN) mitigates PaO2/FiO2loss in pigs with healthy lungs ventilated for 50 h [2].

To date, there is a limit number of studies regards to these parameters compare between recruiters vs. nonrecruiters identified by staircase recruitment maneuver (SRM). Using SRM, we hypothesize whether recruiters would have a higher R/I ratio and higher Vrec than nonrecruiters.Methods:We conducted a prospective experimental study in patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were admitted to a medical intensive care unit. All patients were measured for R/I ratio and Vrec. After that, SRM was performed to identify patients as recruiters (improvement of respiratory compliance (Crs) ≥ 30%) and nonrecruiters (improvement of Crs < 30%). Arterial blood gas parameters and respiratory mechanics were recorded at the baseline, end of SRM, 1 h, and 4 h following SRM. Primary outcome was difference in R/I ratio between recruiters vs. nonrecruiters. Secondary outcome was difference in Vrec between both groups.Results:Twenty-two ARDS patients were enrolled. The most common cause of ARDS was pneumonia (n = 16). Median PaO2/FiO2ratio at the baseline was 176 (interquartile range 93–230). Using improvement of Crs criteria following SRM, there were 17 nonrecruiters and 5 recruiters. No difference in R/I ratio was found between recruiters and nonrecruiters (0.33 vs. 0.23,p= 1.0) (Fig.1upper panel).

Previously, all patients underwent therapy with interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors and glucocorticoids, non-invasive ventilation. The duration of mechanical ventilation before the start of ECMO was 1 ± 0.75 days, PaO2/FiO2index—68 ± 12 mmHg, pHa were 7.25 ± 0.06, lactate 2.5 ± 0.6 mmol/l. ECMO was connected according to the femoral vena-jugular vein scheme, volumetric flow rate 3–4 l/min, oxygen 3 l/min.Results:Disconnected from ECMO 37% (7), discharged 26% (5), 60—day survival—26%. Patients with an unfavorable outcome, compared with those who were discharged, had pronounced leukocytosis 14(10–17) versus 8 (4–8) × 109/l,p= 0.009) and lymphocytopenia 7 ± 4% versus 12 ± 2%,p= 0.007). After initiation of the procedure, by day 3 in the lethal group: SOFA scores increased from 3 to 9 (in the group of survivors from 3 to 4 (p= 0.027)); the level of procalcitonin from 0.2 to 1.45 ng/ml; the number of platelets decreased by 48% (in the group of survivors it increased by 42% (p= 0.011); PaO2/FiO2index did not change significantly (an increase of 200% in the group of survivors up to 206 mmHg (p= 0.011).

The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical course, characteristics and outcomes of patients supported with ECMO for COVID-19 pneumonia.Methods:All adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of Jessa Hospital, Belgium and treated with ECMO between March 13, 2020, and June 30, 2021, were included. Data were prospectively entered into a database that included medical history, demographic data, laboratory results, ventilator settings, ventilator-derived parameters, therapeutic interventions and clinical outcomes. This database was retrospectively reviewed. The primary endpoint is ICU mortality. The study population is categorized based on primary endpoint. A Student t test or Mann Whitney U test and a Chi Square or Fisher's Exact tests were used to evaluated differences between survivors and non-survivors.

Medical history, demographic data, laboratory results, ventilator settings, ventilator-derived parameters, therapeutic interventions and clinical outcomes, stratified for ICU mortality were analysed. ICU mortality was 45.8% (11/24).

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the incidence of pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19 ARDS was higher than in ARDS patients without COVID-19 and whether this difference could be attributed to barotrauma or pulmonary fragility.Methods:We divided the patients into two groups: Group A (patients with ARDS from COVID-19), Group B (patients with ARDS from other causes). All patients were admitted to ICU (intensive care unit) and treated with protective mechanical ventilation—tidal volume 4–6 ml/kg of IBW (ideal body weight), plateau pressure ≤ 28 cmH2O, driving pressure ≤ 12–14 cmH2O.Results:In group A, pneumomediastinum occurred in 8 of 59 patients(13.5%) while in group B in 1 of 59 (1.6%) (p< 0.001). Mortality was 58% in group A patients while 48% in group B patients (p= 0.32). In group A the mean of tidal volume used was 5.6 ± 0.7 ml/kg of IBW, the mean of plateau pressure 22 ± 5 cmH2O and driving pressure 11 ± 4 cmH2O.

An earlier report on the first 52 CTC patients on ECMO treated with CytoSorb showed 69% overall survival [1]. The current analysis focuses on changes in pulmonary function relative to the time of CytoSorb therapy.Methods:A total of 56 patients from 5 U.S. centers were included. Data on demographics, mechanical ventilation (MV), ECMO, and arterial blood gases during CytoSorb therapy were analyzed. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between the timing of initiation of CytoSorb therapy to lung oxygenation according to changes in PaO2/FiO2ratio.Results:In the current analysis, 71% (40/56) overall survival was observed. For these survivors, time to CytoSorb start after ICU admission, MV start, and ECMO start was 138 ± 171.3 h, 83 ± 111.0 h, and 55 ± 156.5 h, respectively, with mean duration of CytoSorb therapy of 83 ± 29.1 h.

We described the prevalence of hyperoxemia and excess O2administration in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and explored the association with mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).Methods:Retrospective single-centre study on 134 patients with SARS-CoV-2 requiring mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 h. We calculated the excess O2administered based on an ideal arterial O2tension (PaO2) target of 55–80 mmHg. We defined hyperoxemia as PaO2> 100 mmHg and hyperoxia + hyperoxemia as an inspired O2fraction (FiO2) > 60% + PaO2> 100 mmHg. Risk factors for ICU-mortality and VAP were assessed with multivariate analyses.Results:Each patient received an excess O2of 1121 [829–1449] l per day of mechanical ventilation. Hyperoxemia was found in 38 [27–55] % of arterial blood gases, hyperoxia + hyperoxemia in 11 [5–18] %. The FiO2was not reduced in 69 [62–76] % of cases of hyperoxemia. Adjustments were more frequent with higher PaO2or initial FiO2levels. ICU-mortality was 32%. VAP was diagnosed in 48.5% of patients. Hyperoxemia (odds ratio [OR] 1.300 95% confidence interval [1.097–1.542]) and hyperoxia + hyperoxemia (OR 1.144 [1.008–1.298]) were associated with higher risk for ICU-mortality, independently of age, Sequential Organ failure Assessment score at ICU-admission and mean PaO2/FiO2. Hyperoxemia (OR 1.033 [1.006–1.061]), hyperoxia + hyperoxemia (OR 1.038 [1.003–1.075]) and daily excess O2(OR 1.001 [1.000–1.001]) were identified as risk factors for VAP, independently of body mass index, blood transfusions, days of neuromuscular blocking agents before VAP, prolonged prone positioning and mean PaO2/FiO2before VAP.Conclusions:Excess O2administration and hyperoxemia were common in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 and may be associated with ICU-mortality and greater risk for VAP.P185The use of mechanical power and driving pressure during mechanical ventilation for ARDS in an ICU in a lower income country (Sri Lanka)K Indraratna, H Yapa, D JayasekeraSri Jayewardenepura"

To assess whether these measurements affect outcomes in patients with ARDS being treated in a lower middle income country.Methods:Patients who fulfilled the Berlin criteria for ARDS [3] were recruited. The arterial blood gas immediately prior to ventilation, the 1st post ventilation blood gas, the ventilator settings on which the patient was stabilized on the first day were considered. The 1st post ventilation blood gas should have fulfilled the Berlin criteria as well to remain in the study. Patients with ejection fractions less than 30, and GCS of 3 prior to ventilation were excluded. Mechanical power and driving pressure were calculated from the first day’s finalized ventilator settings. The ventilator settings, blood gas reports and chest X-rays were collected by an observer who was not privy to the measurements being made. The staff in the ICU were not aware of the measurements being taken.Results:There were 20 patients. Mortality was 60%.45% had mechanical power of over 12.

Pooled Vd/Vt mean difference (MD) between extubation outcomes, and pooled Vd/Vt predictive accuracy measures (sensitivity [Sn], specificity [Sp], diagnostic odds ratio [dOR] and summary area under the curve [AUC]) were determined using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis based on age (pediatric vs adult) was likewise done.Results:Eight studies (684 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Optimal Vd/Vt cutoffs ranged from 0.50 to 0.65. EF patients had higher mean Vd/Vt relative to extubation successes (MD = 0.12; 95% CI 0.06–0.18;p< 0.01). Pooled Sn, Sp and dOR were 0.79 (95% CI 0.66–0.88), 0.74 (95% CI 0.67–0.81) and 9.72 (95% CI 3.89–24.32), respectively. The summary AUC (Fig.1) is 0.83 (95% CI 0.79–0.86).

World pandemic was declared by the WHO in March 2020 [2]. Since then, millions of patients have been infected worldwide. Our group published in March 2021 a multicentre study analysing the prevalence and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection [3]. In this sub analysis of the main study, the primary outcome was the association of sedation level since ICU admission with 28-day mortality in patients admitted to ICU due to COVID-19.Methods:The exposure tested against mortality was excessive sedation (in the coma range) defined as ‘Did patients have a documented sedation score in the coma range at any point this day?

The purpose of this quality improvement project was to examine the sedation practices and requirements of patients who received VV-ECMO in the year prior to and the first year of the COVID epidemic.Methods:This was a single-center, observational study. Adults who received VV-ECMO from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020 were included. Those who received VV-ECMO in 2019 were considered the pre-COVID cohort, while those who received VV-ECMO during 2020 were the COVID cohort. Demographics, clinical and lab parameters, and doses of oral and intravenous (IV) opioids, benzodiazepines (BZD), and other sedatives were recorded.Results:Twelve pre-COVID and 13 COVID patients were included with a mean duration of VV-ECMO of 10 and 27 days, respectively. Mean medication doses during the first week of VV-ECMO and mean duration of use are described in Table1. Patients who received IV opioids (11 vs. 13), IV BZD (12 vs. 13), and propofol (10 each) were similar between groups. Median number of IV sedation agents used was similar between groups (3.5 vs. 4), while the number of oral agents (opioids, BZD, phenobarbital) was higher in the COVID group (0 vs. 2).Conclusions:There were a similar number of IV agents used between the two cohorts.

Our aim is to determine whether ramelteon reduces mortality in critically ill adults.Methods:We conducted a cohort study using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan. We enrolled adult patients admitted to the ICU from April 2018 to March 2021 in Japan. We excluded patients who were admitted to the ICU after 48 h of hospital admission and were discharged or died within 2 days of ICU admission. After multiple imputation (MI) for missing values, propensity score (PS)-based fine stratification weighting (FSW) analysis was performed to compare in-hospital mortality between patients who were administered ramelteon within 48 h of admission (ramelteon group) and those who did not (control group).Results:Of 39,869 ICU patients, 1,755 were in the ramelteon group and 38,144 were in the control group. After MI, PS-based FSW improved the balance of background factors between the two groups. Administration of ramelteon was associated with decreased days of haloperidol use (-0.101 days; 95% CI, − 0.190 to − 0.012) and reducing in-hospital mortality (10.2% vs 12.0%; odds ratio 0.832; 95% CI, 0.695 to 0.996).Conclusions:For critically ill adults, treatment with ramelteon within 48 h of admission was associated with reducing days of haloperidol use and in-hospital mortality.ReferencesBalas MC et al.

LPS and chemotaxis peptide fMLP as stimulants, was assessed by the expression level of CD11b and CD66b, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8, the level of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase GSK-3β. Annexin V and propidium iodide were used to assess apoptosis.Results:Incubation of neutrophils with LPS and fMLP statistically significantly increased the expression of these molecules, namely, when LPS was treated at a dose of 200 ng/ml, the expression of CD11b and CD66b increased 2.3 and 2.2 times (p= 0.002 andp= 0.001, respectively), and upon treatment with fMLP at a dose of 100 nm., the expression of CD11b and CD66b increased by 1.7 and 2.0 times (p= 0.025 andp= 0.03, respectively). Upon incubation of neutrophils with the same LPS concentration after exposure to sevoflurane at a dose of 1.5 MAC, the expression level of CD11b and CD66b increased compared to intact neutrophils. The change in CD11b expression in this experiment was statistically insignificant (p= 0.055), the change in CD66b expression was statistically significant (p= 0.007).

Thus, phosphorylation of GSK-3β in neutrophils by sevoflurane reduces the expression of CD11b and CD66b.Conclusions:Sevoflurane has a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect due to the suppression of neutrophil hyperactivation; one of the possible mechanisms of the effect of sevoflurane on the function of neutrophils is the phosphorylation of GSK-3β.P193Intravenous lidocaine during craniotomy does not blunt inflammatory response to surgeryMC Niño1, D Cohen1, P Aguilar2, EE Rodríguez3, GA Madrid21Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, Neuroanesthesia Service, Bogotá, Colombia,2Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, Anesthesiology Department, Bogotá, Colombia,3Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, Intensive Care Department, Bogotá, ColombiaCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P193Introduction:Intravenous lidocaine has demonstrated to attenuate the proinflammatory effects associated with surgery, in addition to its analgesic properties [1]. Effective modulation of the inflammatory response may improve outcomes for patients undergoing craniotomy. We hypothesized that intravenous lidocaine would attenuate the inflammatory response to craniotomy, measured using widely available biomarkers (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio [NLR] and platelet to lymphocyte ratio [PLR]).Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted included patients at least 18 years old undergoing craniotomy under general anesthesia form January 2015 to December 2019. Exclusion criteria were simultaneous procedures, fever, sepsis, and intraoperative vasopressors. Anesthesia technique was standardized. Lidocaine use was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. NLR and PLR were measured before and 24 h after surgery. The primary outcome was a reduction in biomarkers in the patients exposed to lidocaine. Secondary outcomes were ICU stay, postoperative septic shock, and mortality 20 days after surgery.Results:A sample of 165 patients was analyzed, and 84 (50.9%) of them were exposed to lidocaine. Preoperative and 24-h postoperative values of NLR and PLR were similar between groups of patients. There were no differences in ICU length of stay, opioid consumption, incidence of septic shock, and mortality. Patients who received intraoperative lidocaine had less opioid consumption than those who were not exposed (p< 0.01).Conclusions:Intravenous lidocaine during craniotomy did not blunt the inflammatory response associated with this procedure. However, less opioid consumption was associated with intraoperative infusion of this local anesthetic.ReferenceDunn LK et al.

Anesthesia: propofol to a 3.5–6 mg/kg-hr, fentanyl 1—the 2.8 mcg/kg-h, clonidine 0.4–0.7 mcg/kg-h or dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg-h. We analysed cytokine levels (IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, TNF) at the four times: before induction, after induction, after elimination of the tumor (hemostasis) and the first day after surgery.Results:On the first postoperative day, IL-6 values were on average eight times higher than the average IL-6 values during other stages of the study (Table1). For IL-8 and IL-10, the highest average value is achieved at the stage of hemostasis, while the value of IL-8 is on average one and a half times higher, and the value of IL-10 is four times higher.Conclusions:When analyzing the concentrations of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins, depending on the stage of the perioperative period, the balance of their changes is shown. Pharmacological effect on the opioid and alpha-2-adrenergic systems of the brain provides modulation of the response to stress.Table 1 (abstract P195)Cytokine levels during neurosurgeryIIIIIIIVIL-8, pg/ml9,641 ± 2,0389,357 ± 1,54115,659 ± 4,11310,968 ± 2,019IL-6, pg/ml3,114 ± 0,8422,877 ± 0,6926,550 ± 0,78430,890 ± 4,557IL-10, pg/ml4,118 ± 0,7514,618 ± 0,89016,158 ± 4,1265,142 ± 0,732TNF, pg/ml8,391 ± 0,4507,915 ± 0,3878,316 ± 0,4357,005 ± 0,347P196ICU-free and ventilator-free days with isoflurane or propofol as a primary sedative: apost-hocanalysis of the Sedaconda studyH Bracht1, A Meiser2, J Wallenborn3, R Knafelj4, P Sackey5, J Nilsson6, M Bellgardt71University Hospital Ulm, Dept.

    "full_text": "Sedaconda study was an RCT in invasively ventilated patients, comparing inhaled isoflurane (Iso) via the Sedaconda Anaesthetic Conserving Device (ACD) to iv propofol (iP) [1]. 150 patients received Iso and 151 iP, for up to 48 ± 6 h or extubation, whichever was first. Continued sedation, if needed, was at the physician’s discretion. We compared ICU-free days (ICU-FD) and ventilator-free days (VFD) in patients receiving the initial drug and never converting to the other drug in the 30 days from randomisation.Methods:69 Iso patients not switching to iP and 109 iP patients not switching to Iso after the study period were analysed. Study groups had similar demographic and clinical baseline characteristics (Table1).Results:The Iso group had significantly more ICU-FD than the iP group (15.9 vs 11.6,p= 0.008). VFD in Iso and iP were 18.6 and 16.6 respectively (p= 0.231). Additional analyses:Comparing only patients that were further sedated after the study period (43 Iso patients vs 81 iP patients); the Iso group had more ICU-FD (14.7 vs. 9.6,p= 0.017) than the iP group. VFD for Iso vs iP were 18.7 and 14.8 respectively (p= 0.103).Controlling for SAPS II at baseline; the Iso group had more ICU-FD than the iP group (15.6 vs 12.4 ICU-free days,p= 0.043).

The aim of our work was to characterize an IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulin with focus on IgA, IgM and the presence of J-chain which enables immunoglobulin transport to mucosa.Methods:We characterized the IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulin Pentaglobin® (76% IgG, 12% IgA, 12% IgM) by measuring the ratio of IgG and IgA subclasses. Relative distribution of monomeric and multimeric immunoglobulins was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Specific detection of IgG, IgA, IgM and J-chain was performed by western-blot. J-chain was quantified by ELISA.Results:The immunoglobulin distribution reveal the presence of several immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG/IgA/IgM) as well as IgG and IgA subclasses. Molecular size distribution reveal multiple multimeric species. Subsequent western-blot analysis shows pentameric IgM and dimeric IgA with J-chain, as well as monomeric IgG and IgA (Fig.1). J-chain ELISA quantifies a notable portion of IgA and IgM molecules that is associated with J-chain.Conclusions:The results of this study show the biochemical complexity of polyvalent IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulins. The data highlight a substantial portion of multimeric IgM and IgA species. The presence of J-chain indicates the potential secretion of IgA and IgM onto mucosa. These observed biochemical properties could explain the beneficial effects of IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulins compared to standard IVIg in therapy of severe infections.ReferencesKakoullis L et al.

All The patients were 60 + -10 years old and mechanically ventilated. On admission, a first group receiving IVIG and antibiotics (study group) and a second group receving placebo(saline) and antibiotics (control group). IVIG were administered on the first hour of admission at a dose of 0.5 g/kg during 3 days and infused continuously at 3 ml/kg/h. IVIG were preceded by administration of ceftriaxon-levofloxacin.

Animals were randomized to three groups control, concurrent treatment (CuT) and post treatment (PT) group (N = 8 each) after surgical preparation and stabilization. STC3141 was given as bolus (1 mg/kg) + continuous (1 ml/kg/h). It was started at sepsis inducement in the CuT group and 4 h after in the PT group. During the first 4 h, fluid was maintained at 2 ml/kg/h. 4 h after sepsis, fluid resuscitation (maintain pulse pressure variation < 13%), antibiotics and peritoneal lavage were administrated, and norepinephrine was given to maintain mean arterial blood pressure > 65 mmHg if necessary. Experiment lasted for 24 h.Results:During the first 4 h, MAP was maintained in the CuT group, while dropped significantly in the PT and Control group. Significantly lower dose of NE and lactate levels was observed in the two treatment groups compared to the control group. Impaired sublingual microcirculation significantly improved at 6 h in the two treatment groups at 18 h in the PT group. Survival benefit tended to be longer in the two treatment groups (p= 0.075).Conclusions:Neutralization of histones with STC3141 in sepsis quickly stabilized hemodynamics with less NE utilization, ameliorated impaired microcirculation and improved tissue perfusion, which might provide a new therapeutic approach for sepsis.P200A novel virotherapy encoding human interleukin 7 enhancesex vivolymphocyte functions in immunosuppressed septic shock and critically ill COVID-19 patientsM Crausaz1, G Monneret2, P Martin1, F Conti2, A Lukaszewicz3, G Inchauspé1, F Venet41Transgene, Department of Infectious Diseases, Lyon, France,2EA 7426 Pathophysiology of injury-induced immunosuppression (PI3), Lyon 1 University/ Hospices Civils de Lyon / bioMérieux, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France,3Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Service d’anesthésie-réanimation, Lyon, France,4Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Laboratoire d’Immunologie, Lyon, FranceCritical Care2022,26(Suppl 1):P200Introduction:After viral or bacterial sepsis, most intensive care unit (ICU) patients enter a state of profound immunosuppression contributing to patients’ worsening.
