This is the fifth annual summary of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations; a more comprehensive review was done in 2020. This latest summary addresses the most recently published resuscitation evidence reviewed by International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation task force science experts. Topics covered by systematic reviews in this summary include resuscitation topics of video-based dispatch systems; head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation; early coronary angiography after return of spontaneous circulation; cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the prone patient; cord management at birth for preterm and term infants; devices for administering positive-pressure ventilation at birth; family presence during neonatal resuscitation; self-directed, digitally based basic life support education and training in adults and children; coronavirus disease 2019 infection risk to rescuers from patients in cardiac arrest; and first aid topics, including cooling with water for thermal burns, oral rehydration for exertional dehydration, pediatric tourniquet use, and methods of tick removal. Members from 6 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation task forces have assessed, discussed, and debated the quality of the evidence, according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, and their statements include consensus treatment recommendations or good practice statements. Insights into the deliberations of the task forces are provided in Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights sections. In addition, the task forces listed priority knowledge gaps for further research.

This 2021 review includes 13 topics addressed with systematic reviews (SysRevs) by the 6 ILCOR task forces and an additional topic reviewed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) working group. Although only a SysRev can generate a full CoSTR and updated treatment recommendations, many other topics were reviewed via more streamlined approaches, detailed below.Draft CoSTRs for all topics evaluated with SysRevs were posted on a rolling basis from November 2020 through March 2021 on the ILCOR website1and included the data reviewed and draft treatment recommendations, with comments accepted for at least 2 weeks after each posting date. The 9 draft CoSTR statements were viewed ≈11 000 times, and 154 comments were provided as feedback. These CoSTRs are now available online, adding to the existing CoSTR statements.This summary contains the final wording of the treatment recommendations and good practice statements as approved by the task forces and by the ILCOR member councils, but it differs in several respects from the online CoSTRs: The language used to describe the evidence in this summary is not restricted to standard Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) terminology, thereby making it more transparent to a wider audience; in some cases, only the high-priority outcomes are reported; the Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights sections are in some cases shortened but aim to provide insight into the rationale behind the treatment recommendations; and finally, the task forces have prioritized knowledge gaps requiring future research. Links to the published reviews and full online CoSTR are provided in the individual sections.The CoSTRs are based on task force analysis of the data using the GRADE approach.1Each analysis has been detailed either in a SysRev conducted by a Knowledge Synthesis Unit or a systematic reviewer or as a task force–led SysRev, and always with input from ILCOR content experts. This GRADE approach rates the certainty of evidence supporting the intervention (predefined by the population, intervention, comparator, outcome [PICO] question) as high, moderate, low, or very low.

Certainty of evidence can be downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias; it can be upgraded for a large effect, a dose-response effect, or if any residual confounding would be thought to reduce the detected effect.In addition to the certainty of evidence, each statement includes the pertinent outcome data. The format for the data varies by what is available but ideally includes both risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI and risk difference with 95% CI. The risk difference is the absolute difference between the risks and is calculated by subtracting the risk in the control group from the risk in the intervention group. This absolute effect enables a more clinically useful assessment of the magnitude of the effect of an intervention and enables calculation of the number needed to treat (number needed to treat=1/risk difference). In cases when the data do not enable absolute effect estimates to be determined, alternative measures of effect such as odds ratios (ORs) are reported.Treatment recommendations are generated by the task forces after weighing the evidence and after task force discussion. The strength of a recommendation is determined by the task force and is not necessarily tied to the certainty of evidence. Although ILCOR generally has not produced any guidance when the evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation, in some cases good practice statements have been provided for topics thought to be of particular interest to the resuscitation community. Good practice statements are not recommendations but represent expert opinion in light of very limited data.ILCOR’s goal is to review at least 20% of all PICO questions each year so that the CoSTRs reflect current and emerging science. To facilitate this goal and acknowledging that many PICO topics will not have sufficient new evidence to warrant a SysRev, ILCOR implemented 2 additional levels of evidence review in 2020, which were also used for 2021. Scoping reviews (ScopRevs) are undertaken when there is a lack of clarity on the amount and type of evidence on a broader topic. ScopRevs are broad searches done in multiple databases with a rigor similar to that of a SysRev but do not include bias assessments or meta-analyses. The third and least rigorous form of evidence evaluation is the evidence update (EvUp), in which a PubMed search is carried out to screen for significant new data and assess whether there has been sufficient new science to warrant a new ScopRev or SysRev. Both ScopRevs and EvUps can inform a decision about whether a SysRev should be undertaken but are not used to generate a new or updated CoSTR because they do not include bias assessment, GRADE evaluation, or meta-analyses.

The SysRev was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; Registration CRD42020219112).The full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.2PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Adults and children with presumed cardiac arrest in the out-of-hospital setting•Intervention: Patients/cases or EMS systems through which dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR) is offered by video and audio communication between dispatcher center and scene•Comparator: Patients/cases or EMS systems through which DA-CPR is offered by audio-only communication between dispatcher center and scene•Outcome: Any clinical outcome (survival with favorable neurological outcome, survival, ROSC, and CPR quality)•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligible for inclusion; unpublished studies (eg, conference abstracts, trial protocols) were excluded.•Time frame: All years and all languages were included as long as there was an English abstract. Literature search was updated to February 8, 2021.Consensus on ScienceOnly 1 observational study was identified.3For the critical outcome of good neurological function at discharge, we identified very low–certainty evidence from 1 observational study enrolling 1720 adult OHCAs, which showed benefit from the use of video-based dispatch compared with standard audio-based dispatch (OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.18–3.04];P<0.01). However, the benefit was not observed after multivariable statistical adjustment (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.73–2.26]) or propensity score–matching analysis (OR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.51–1.64]). Similarly, the group receiving video-based dispatch had higher rates of survival to discharge and ROSC compared with the group receiving standard audio-based dispatch in unadjusted analysis, but there were no significant differences between the groups after multivariable statistical adjustment and propensity score–matching analysis.3We also identified 13 manikin simulation studies that compared video-based with audio-based dispatch.4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.,10.,11.,12.,13.,14.,15.,16.The simulation studies showed improved CPR quality parameters such as compression rate and time to compression in the video-based dispatch group but did not show any significant differences in chest compression depth, correct"

Despite limited evidence, the BLS Task Force considered it important to encourage research in this important area and therefore provided a conditional recommendation for video-based dispatch systems to be assessed in clinical trials or research initiatives.Several manikin simulation studies were identified comparing video-based with audio-based dispatch. Lin et al17published a SysRev of simulation studies comparing the effect of video-based dispatch with the effect of audio-based dispatch on quality of DA-CPR. The review included 6 simulation studies that showed that video-based DA-CPR significantly improved the chest compression rate compared with audio-based dispatch, and a trend toward more correct hand position was also observed. However, video-based dispatch was associated with a delay in the start of bystander-initiated CPR.17Although not directly informing clinical practice, these simulation studies provide important information about the aspects that need to be addressed and evaluated in future clinical studies evaluating video-based dispatch.Task Force Knowledge Gaps•RCT evidence comparing video-based dispatch with audio-based dispatch in any patient population•Further observational evidence evaluating the use of video communication in emergency medical dispatch•Whether 2 rescuers are needed to effectively process video-based DA-CPR: 1 to provide chest compressions and 1 to handle the mobile phone and assist with communication. This might lead to varying feasibility of implementing video-based dispatcher CPR according to location of arrest (crowded public place versus at home) and other variables.Head-Up CPR (SysRev)Rationale for ReviewThis topic was prioritized by the BLS Task Force because of increasing interest and debate surrounding head-up CPR within the resuscitation community. Head-up CPR has been suggested as an alternative CPR method, potentially improving cerebral perfusion by facilitating venous return from the brain. The BLS Task Force was aware of the growing body of animal research addressing head-up CPR18.,19.,20.,21.,22.,23.and that this strategy is currently being used in some EMS systems. The evidence review was performed in collaboration with the ALS Task Force. Because there was no intent to publish this SysRev outside of the 2021 CoSTR, PROSPERO registration was not done.The full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.24PICO, Study"

Literature search was updated to January 22, 2021.Consensus on ScienceOnly 1 observational study was identified.25For the important outcome of survival to hospital admission, we identified very low–certainty evidence from 1 observational (before-and-after) study enrolling 1835 adult OHCAs; the study showed an increased rate of ROSC at hospital arrival in patients receiving −20° head-up CPR compared with standard care (RR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.61–2.26];P<0.001; absolute risk reduction, 16.1% [95% CI, 20.0%–12.2%], or 161 [95% CI, 109–225] more patients per 1000 survived with the intervention more). Notably, both head-up CPR and standard resuscitation in this study were bundled with mechanical CPR and the use of an impedance threshold device. Head-up CPR, but not standard care, was also accompanied by deferred PPV for several minutes and the deployment of a pit-crew approach for more efficient placement of the mechanical CPR device. No studies were identified that compared head-up CPR alone with standard care.This technique has also been evaluated in animal laboratory studies (also in concert with mechanical CPR and an impedance threshold device) with mixed outcomes, but those studies were not included in this review, which focused on clinical data.18.,19.,20.,21.,22.,23.Treatment RecommendationsWe suggest against the routine use of head-up CPR during CPR (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).We suggest that the usefulness of head-up CPR during CPR be assessed in clinical trials or research initiatives (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is included inSupplemental Appendix A1.The limited observational evidence identified in this review suggests that head-up CPR might have the potential to improve short-term outcome from cardiac arrest, but the certainty of evidence is very low with very high risk of bias.

Outcome measures were also limited to ROSC at the time of hospital arrival, without any information on longer-term survival or functional outcomes.Implementation of the head-up CPR bundle requires purchase of equipment (mechanical CPR and the impedance threshold device), along with education and training in the use of this equipment and the technique for deploying head-up CPR. Without a demonstrable improvement in longer-term outcomes, it is unlikely to be an acceptable strategy for key stakeholders. The BLS Task Force does not find the current evidence sufficient to recommend routine use of this strategy and encourages further research before its clinical deployment.Task Force Knowledge Gaps•Comparisons of head-up CPR alone with standard care•RCT evidence evaluating the effect of head-up CPR either alone or as part of a bundle of care•The effect of head-up CPR on longer-term outcomes such as survival and neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge or 30 daysBystander CPR in Drowning (BLS 856: ScopRev)Rationale for ReviewDrowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for >360 000 deaths annually.26Submersion in water leads to the rapid onset of hypoxemia. If someone who has drowned is left untreated, cardiac arrest occurs within minutes. The initiation of CPR by a bystander allows treatment to be delivered before EMS arrives, but its effects on outcomes after drowning are uncertain. The BLS Task Force, in collaboration with several experts on drowning, considered it timely to undertake a ScopRev of the literature to identify any new evidence on multiple BLS topics in the context of drowning.27The full text of this ScopRev can be found on the ILCOR website.28PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Adults and children who are submerged in water•Intervention: Bystander CPR•Comparator: No bystander CPR•Outcome: Any clinical outcome (eg, survival, survival with a favorable neurological outcome, hospitalization)•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligible for inclusion.

The apparent superiority of conventional CPR, which includes ventilation, has biological plausibility because cardiac arrest attributable to drowning is caused primarily by hypoxemia. The findings of this review are consistent with the 2020 ILCOR recommendation that chest compressions be performed for all patients in cardiac arrest.49ILCOR suggests that those who are trained, able, and willing to give rescue breaths and chest compressions do so for all adult patients in cardiac arrest.49Rescue breaths are likely to be particularly important in patients who sustain a cardiac arrest attributable to hypoxemia after drowning.

A single retrospective observational study reported the outcomes of adults and children who were rescued unconscious and not breathing from the ocean in Brazil.52The other 4 studies were manikin studies conducted in swimming pools53,54and open water.55,56The clinical study reported survival status and neurological outcome of 19 patients who received in-water resuscitation compared with 27 patients who did not.52The in-water resuscitation protocol recommended performing up to 1 minute of ventilation before attempting to bring the unconscious and not-breathing patient to the shore. For patients in deep water, in-water resuscitation required the availability of rescue flotation equipment or at least 2 rescuers. In the prehospital setting, initial survival was significantly higher in the in-water resuscitation group (94.7% versus 37.0%;P<0.001). The rate of survival at hospital discharge was higher in the in-water resuscitation group (87.5% versus 25%;P<0.005), as was favorable neurological outcome (52.6% versus 7.4%;P<0.001).52All other studies were crossover trials that evaluated the capacity of lifeguards53.,54.,55.,56.and laypeople54to perform in-water resuscitation while simulating a water rescue with a manikin.

Two studies showed that tracheal intubation was associated with worse outcome (OR for good outcome, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.08–0.83]67; OR, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01–0.2]).40One study showed that mobile medical team ventilation was associated with better outcomes (44% versus 17% survival to admission).65Task Force InsightsThe studies reviewed show that tracheal intubation is a feasible intervention after a water submersion incident. The association between tracheal intubation and poor outcomes is almost certainly confounded by the fact that tracheal intubation is limited to more severe drowning.The limited evidence base identified in the ScopRev suggests little benefit from a full SysRev to evaluate advanced airway management compared with no advanced airway management after drowning. In the absence of data supporting an alternative strategy, there is no reason to deviate from the ALS Task Force recommendations for airway management.68Treatment RecommendationsThere was no previous treatment recommendation on advanced airway management after drowning. The lack of evidence in the drowning setting supports the use of standard ALS Task Force recommendations for airway management.68Prehospital Oxygen in Drowning (BLS 856: ScopRev)Rationale for ReviewThe use of prehospital oxygen has the potential to reverse hypoxemia and may improve outcomes. However, providing access to oxygen therapy has substantial resource implications to cover the costs of equipment and training. Without access to pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis, identifying patients who may benefit from oxygen therapy can be difficult.The full text of this ScopRev can be found on the ILCOR website.69PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Adults and children who are submerged in water•Intervention: Prehospital oxygen administration•Comparator: No prehospital oxygen administration•Outcome: Any clinical outcome (eg, survival, survival with a favorable neurological outcome, hospitalization), physiological end points•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligible for inclusion.

One study documented a higher rate of hospital admission in patients with an initial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) no higher than 95% on arrival in the emergency department (92% versus 52%; adjusted OR, 6.8 [95% CI, 1.07–43.8]).70Hospital admission rates were also higher (91% versus 34%) among 71 children with an initial Spo2<92% at the scene or on arrival in the emergency department in univariate but not multivariate analysis.71In contrast, another study did not find an association between Pao2/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) ratio and the duration of hospital stay among 43 adults and children.72In an observational study involving 31 adults, lower blood oxygen saturations (87% versus 76%;P=0.007) and Pao2/Fio2ratios (255 versus 133;P=0.004) were associated with reduced survival with favorable neurological outcome.73Task Force InsightsThe review found no direct evidence to guide the prehospital use of oxygen therapy in drowning. Yet, the primary cause of death from drowning is insufficient oxygen delivery to the heart and brain, and prompt restoration of oxygen delivery is of paramount importance. The indirect evidence identified in this review suggests frequent need for supplemental oxygen in patients who have drowned. Work in other domains of resuscitation science has identified adverse outcomes associated with both sustained hypoxia and hyperoxia. Pulse oximetry can be unreliable, particularly after cold-water immersion,74but when feasible can enable continuous titration of Fio2after restoration of spontaneous circulation.Treatment RecommendationsThere was no previous treatment recommendation on prehospital use of oxygen therapy in drowning. The lack of evidence for a different approach to prehospital oxygen therapy in the drowning setting supports the use of standard ALS Task Force recommendations to avoid hypoxemia and hyperoxia by using 100% inspired oxygen until arterial oxygen saturation or the partial pressure of arterial oxygen can be measured, after which oxygen can be titrated to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation in the normal range.68AED Use in Drowning (BLS 856: ScopRev)Rationale for ReviewAlthough the most common cause of cardiac arrest associated with drowning is hypoxemia, in some cases, a primary cardiac arrythmia may be the precipitating event. The use of an AED in such cases may be lifesaving, but this needs to be balanced against the risk of harm from interruptions to CPR for patients with nonshockable rhythms. Although ILCOR recommends the use of AEDs, their role in the setting of resuscitation from drowning is not clearly defined.The full text of this ScopRev can be found on the ILCOR website.75PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Adults and children who are submerged in water•Intervention: AED"

Indirect evidence of AED use was found from 15 observational studies. Four studies involving 1044 patients showed a range of AED use in cases of suspected drowning before the arrival of EMS of 5% to 32%.37,43,58,76In 12 studies involving 14 920 patients, a shockable rhythm in OHCA attributable to drowning was uncommon, with a reported range of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia between 2% and 14%.30,33,35,37.,38.,39.,43,45,58,67,76,77Among 7 observational studies involving 1846 patients in cardiac arrest after drowning, a shockable rhythm was not associated with better survival.30,33,43,58,67,76,77In 1 study with 776 drowning survivors, only 0.4% were defibrillated at the emergency department.78In 1 study involving 529 patients in a multivariable analysis, although a shockable rhythm did not improve survival to hospital admission, there was an association between shockable rhythm and increased 30-day survival (OR, 4.12 [95% CI, 1.13–13.71]).38In 1 simulation study testing 6 AEDs on 3 different boats in moderate sea conditions, use of AEDs seemed feasible.63In 1 simulation study with 616 lifeguards, mean time from arrival to defibrillation was 62 seconds (SD, 20 seconds).79In 1 study, a case of inappropriate shock delivered to a patient in asystole with artifacts on the ECG resulting from movements was described, with no obvious consequences.58No adverse events were reported in the studies identified in this review.Task Force InsightsStudies reviewed showed that using AEDs in cardiac arrest in the drowning setting appears to be feasible and safe, although the chances of a shockable rhythm may be lower (2%–14%) than for a primary cardiac cause. The current ILCOR treatment recommendation suggests a short period of CPR until the defibrillator is ready for analysis or until defibrillation in unmonitored cardiac arrest. This may be particularly important in situations in which the cardiac arrest was caused by drowning.49Treatment RecommendationsThere was no previous treatment recommendation on AED use after drowning; a SysRev will be"

Two articles reported neurological outcome (Glasgow Coma Scale) and severity of oxygen impairment.82,84Three studies reported the feasibility of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) use in patients with respiratory failure after drowning.81,82,84In a multicenter, retrospective observational study across 7 French intensive care units (ICUs), 48 adults received NIV (both continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure; average positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 8±2 cm H2O) to treat moderate to severe lung injury (mean Pao2/Fio2ratio, 156 mm Hg).84Compared with patients treated with invasive mechanical ventilation, those receiving NIV had a better initial neurological and hemodynamic status. NIV was successful in 92% (44 of 48), with an average duration of ventilation of 1.4 days.

The evidence identified supports the existing ILCOR treatment recommendation.68Similarly, the evidence identified for severe respiratory failure is consistent with guidelines suggesting the use of ECMO in select patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).85Treatment RecommendationsThere was no previous treatment recommendation on ECMO after drowning. The evidence identified supports the ILCOR treatment recommendation that states “ECPR may be considered as a rescue therapy for selected patients with cardiac arrest when conventional CPR is failing in settings in which it can be implemented (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).”68A SysRev will be pursued by the BLS and ALS Task Forces.Criteria for Discharge in Drowning (BLS 856: ScopRev)Rationale for ReviewSubmersion leads to a spectrum of presentations from no or mild symptoms to severe hypoxemia or cardiac arrest.

Additional objective factors that were analyzed were chest radiography (341 patients)70,71,101and arterial blood gas results (161 patients).70,71Pooled together, these studies found that for drowning patients <18 years of age presenting to the emergency department with normal mentation, an observation period of at least 6 hours appears to be sufficient to allow any clinical deterioration to be revealed. Patients who remain with normal mentation, no need for supplemental oxygen, and normal age-adjusted vital signs can be considered for discharge at that time.Task Force InsightsThis small body of evidence demonstrated associations between clinical and physiological factors and the likelihood of hospital admission after a submersion incident.

It was also acknowledged that it was very unclear which patients might benefit, and the evidence at that time was primarily observational. Because of the recent publication of additional evidence, including RCTs, on the question of CAG after ROSC after cardiac arrest, this SysRev was undertaken to evaluate the impact of early CAG on key clinical outcomes in patients who remain comatose after ROSC following cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020160152).The full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.105PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Unresponsive* adults (>18 years of age) with ROSC after cardiac arrest•Intervention: Emergency or early CAG with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if indicated; early CAG defined as within 2 to 6 hours•Comparator: Delayed CAG defined as within 24 hours; both time intervals start at hospital arrival or from ROSC•Outcome: Any clinical outcome prioritized as critical or important by the ALS Task Force•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligible for inclusion.

    "full_text": "from extremely low–certainty evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many critically ill patients treated with prone positioning and has made this an important question for clinicians worldwide.The task force weighed the risk of delaying chest compressions and defibrillation while a patient is supinated against the risk of CPR and defibrillation being less effective in the prone position and acknowledged that the balance of risks is unclear.The task force considered that further studies would be feasible and useful. These could include larger case series from single or multiple centers or case reports on quality metrics such as ETCO2and arterial blood pressure during prone compressions. More data on patients in the ICU in particular are needed because virtually all published case reports on prone CPR concern patients positioned prone for spinal or brain surgery in the operating room.In many ICU settings, patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the prone position are highly likely to have arterial lines and continuous ETCO2monitoring, thus enabling the effectiveness of prone compressions to be determined rapidly. The task force discussed that evidence of ineffective compressions (ETCO2or mean arterial pressure below the usual CPR targets) could indicate more urgency to supination.The difficulty of supinating a patient will vary widely depending on patient size; personnel present; interventions in place such as chest tubes, advanced airways, and intravenous lines; personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation requirements; potentially open wounds; exposed hardware; or unstable spine (in the case of patients having surgery). This may affect decisions on whether to perform CPR prone or to supinate a patient first.The cause of the cardiac arrest will determine the urgency of supination. For example, a primary airway problem such as a dislodged tracheal tube will require immediate supination, whereas the need for hemorrhage control during surgery in the prone position may necessitate resuscitation in the prone position.Task Force Knowledge GapsThere is almost no evidence beyond case reports on this topic. Some highlighted knowledge gaps include the following:•The average time taken to supinate a critically ill patient or a patient in the operating room in a real clinical setting•Data on outcomes in patients arresting in the prone position who receive CPR or defibrillation while prone compared with those who are supinated before CPR start or defibrillation•Comparative data on CPR metrics such as ETCO2and arterial blood pressure during compressions done in the prone and supine positions, as well as time to CPR start and first defibrillation or dose of epinephrine•The risk of aerosolization or infection transmission from supinating a patient in cardiac arrest•Optimal hand placement and defibrillator pad placement for prone CPR and defibrillationConsciousness During CPR (ScopRev)Rationale for ReviewCPR-induced consciousness is"

In 143 survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest or OHCA from the United States, sedation or analgesia immediately before, during, or after CPR was not associated with the development of posttraumatic stress disorder.152A UK study of awareness during CPR in 140 survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest identified 2 patients who described awareness with explicit recall of seeing and hearing events during their resuscitation.153In interviews of Australian health care professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics), 59 of 67 had witnessed CPR-induced consciousness during which the patient had not interfered with the CPR attempt, with 10 reporting having to pause CPR, 7 reassuring the patient, 16 using sedation or neuromuscular-blocking drugs, and 2 using physical restraints.154Consciousness during CPR interfering with resuscitation (eg, the patient preventing chest compressions or trying to pull out tubes and lines) was reported by 51 of 63 interviewees, with 7 pausing CPR, 23 using sedation or paralyzing drugs, and 7 using physical restraints. The interviews highlighted a need for further guidance on this issue."

Twenty-four case reports or series that described 31 cases of consciousness during CPR were published since 1962, with sedative drugs being used in ≈30%.157.,158.,159.,160.,161.,162.,163.,164.,165.,166.,167.,168.,169.,170.,171.,172.,173.,174.,175.,176.,177.,178.,179.,180.Existing drug regimens were identified that included the use of ketamine, midazolam, or fentanyl or a combination of these drugs.Task Force InsightsThe ALS Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to warrant a formal SysRev. Distinguishing between overt physical signs of consciousness and transcendental cognitive experiences may be important because the psychological impact may vary greatly. Patients with physical signs of consciousness are more likely to experience pain and distress than those with out-of-body–type experiences; thus, optimal management may be different.Evidence suggests that CPR-induced consciousness may have harmful effects on the rescuer and that CPR-induced consciousness probably signifies very recent sudden cardiac arrest and effective brain perfusion during CPR, thus being associated with better outcomes.Some patient recall of events during CPR may relate to events that occurred before cardiac arrest, after ROSC, or during recovery. There needs to be a wider recognition of patient cognitive experiences among clinicians. Many patients are afraid to discuss these experiences because they feel that clinicians will not be receptive. There is a need for space to discuss these experiences and a need for awareness of resources available to manage ongoing problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder in both patients and rescuers.There is an absence of standardized reporting criteria for the phenomena experienced by patients during CPR. In addition, the optimal drugs (including dosage) to manage CPR-induced consciousness (speed of effectiveness and impact on cardiac arrest outcomes) are unknown. Sedative drugs may have harmful cardiovascular effects, beneficial neuroprotective effects, or both. How sedative drugs given during CPR may affect post-ROSC"

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, drug regimens should be extrapolated from experience of sedation and analgesia in critically ill patients and using the smallest possible drug dose to achieve a desired effect.Treatment RecommendationsThis is a new topic, and there is insufficient evidence to warrant progressing to a SysRev of interventions for CPR-induced consciousness. Given the interest in this topic, the task force considered the available evidence and made the following good practice statements:In settings in which it is feasible, rescuers may consider using sedative or analgesic drugs (or both) in very small doses to prevent pain and distress to patients who are conscious during CPR (good practice statement).Neuromuscular-blocking drugs alone should not be given to conscious patients (good practice statement).The optimal drug regimen for sedation and analgesia during CPR is uncertain. Regimens can be based on those used in critically ill patients and according to local protocols (good practice statement).Evidence UpdatesThe topics reviewed by EvUps are summarized inTable 6, and complete EvUps are provided inSupplemental Appendix B2.Table 6ALS Topics Reviewed by EvUpsTopic/PICOYear(s) last updatedExisting treatment recommendationRelevant studies since last review, nSufficient data to warrant SysRev?Transition from nonshockable to shockable rhythm (ALS 444)2010 CoSTRNoneNo studiesNoOxygen dose during CPR (ALS 889)2015 CoSTR; 2020 EvUpWe suggest using the highest possible inspired oxygen concentration during CPR (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).No studiesNoSteroids duringCPR (ALS 433)2015 CoSTR; 2020 EvUpFor IHCA, the task force was unable to reach a consensus recommendation for or against the use of steroids during cardiac arrest.We suggest against the routine use of steroids during CPR for OHCA (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).2 SysRevs, 3 RCTs registered with trial registries yet to reportConsider after publication of ongoing RCTsConfirmation of correct tracheal tube position (ALS 469)2015 CoSTRWe recommend using waveform capnography to confirm and continuously monitor the position of a tracheal tube during CPR in addition to clinical assessment (strong recommendation, low–quality evidence).1 SysRev, 2 observational studiesNoAutomatic ventilators vs manual ventilation during CPR (ALS 490)2010 CoSTRThere is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of an automatic transport ventilator over manual ventilation during resuscitation of the patient with cardiac arrest with an advanced airway.2 RCTs (simulation studies), 2 observational studiesNoCardiac arrest caused by asthma (ALS 492)2010 CoSTRThere is insufficient evidence to suggest any routine change to cardiac arrest resuscitation treatment algorithms for patients with cardiac arrest caused"

    "full_text": "flow, enabling pulmonary venous return to replace umbilical venous return as the primary source of preload for the left ventricle. Cardiac output markedly increases, and the heart rate stabilizes. In contrast, for infants who are apneic and hypoxic at birth, immediate cord clamping decreases cardiac output. Because increased cardiac output counteracts the effects of hypoxemia, limiting the increase in cardiac output exposes the infant to the combination of ischemia and hypoxia.182Such instability can be avoided if the infant’s lungs are aerated and pulmonary blood flow increases before the umbilical cord is clamped. Large swings in arterial pressure and flow are reduced, leading to a more stable circulatory transition.182For many years, the umbilical cord was routinely clamped immediately after birth. However, improved understanding of the potentially negative effects of immediate cord clamping led to investigation and use of many different cord-management strategies for preterm infants. In 2015, the ILCOR Neonatal Life Support Task Force published 2 CoSTRs summarizing the evidence comparing later (delayed) cord clamping (≥30 seconds) with earlier cord clamping (<30 seconds) and comparing intact-cord milking with early cord clamping for preterm newborn infants.183.,184.,185.Additional evidence has accumulated, and alternative techniques have been studied. Thus, ILCOR prioritized scientific review of all umbilical cord-management strategies for preterm births (PROSPERO registration CRD42019155475).186The full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.187PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Moderate, very, and extremely preterm infants (or equivalent birth weight) <34 (+0) weeks (plus days) gestation•Intervention: (1) Later (delayed) cord clamping, (2) intact-cord milking, and (3) cut-cord milking•Comparator:A.

In these situations, we suggest individualized decisions based on severity of the condition and assessment of maternal and neonatal risk (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is provided inSupplemental Appendix A3.Our suggestions/recommendations were based on several inferences. First, the critical outcome of survival with later (delayed) clamping versus early clamping suggests benefit or neutrality from delaying clamping, and there are no significant differences in other critical outcomes for all comparisons.

We do not have sufficient confidence in these findings to make separate recommendations for cord management by country income, gestational age, or interval from birth to cord clamping (>30 seconds). We consider that the beneficial effect of delayed clamping in high-income countries is likely to be widely generalizable and therefore should be offered in all settings.There is very little evidence to make recommendations for cord management in the preterm infant needing immediate resuscitation.Our suggestions and recommendations are provided in the context of both immediate and deferred clamping being commonly practiced after preterm delivery and in light of historical and regional changes in cord-management practices over past decades.230We acknowledge the perception of immediate clamping as a medical intervention and of deferring clamping as a natural, or physiological, approach and the paradox that many studies defined immediate clamping as the control.231We were influenced by current cord-management practices with respect to preterm delivery. If our current norm were delayed clamping, we would have rejected early clamping and recommended further study of cord milking as an alternative in infants born at ≥28 weeks’ gestational age. However, if our current norm were early clamping, our recommendations to change current practice would have to be more cautious, given the weak evidence.Some animal studies suggest that cardiorespiratory transition after birth occurs more effectively when cord clamping is deferred.232There are also societal, maternal, and practitioner preferences for the timing of cord clamping.With respect to equity, acceptability, accessibility, and cost, deferring cord clamping for ≥30 seconds and intact-cord milking are inexpensive, readily available, universally applicable interventions that can be performed regardless of setting.233The beneficial effect of delayed clamping in high-income countries is likely to be generalizable; therefore, it should be offered in all settings.

At the time of birth, ≈30% of the fetal-placental circulation is outside the fetus. Cord management affects the volume of placental transfusion to the newborn infant and the cardiovascular transition around the onset of breathing or ventilation.235Thus, early cord clamping before onset of breathing may have major hemodynamic consequences not only for preterm newborn infants but also for term and near-term, nonvigorous newborn infants. Cord management at birth also influences iron status and possibly neurodevelopment of full-term infants.236,237Iron deficiency in young children is associated with impaired motor development, behavioral problems, and cognitive delays.238.,239.,240.Cord management and placental transfusion at"

Subgroup analyses according to the timing of uterotonic medication administration and according to size for gestational age: The subgroup analyses for the timing of uterotonic medication administration and for size for gestational age did not reveal significant differences between subgroups.Treatment RecommendationsFor term and late preterm infants born at ≥34 weeks’ gestation who are vigorous or deemed not to require immediate resuscitation at birth, we suggest later (delayed) clamping of the cord at ≥60 seconds (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is provided inSupplemental Appendix A3.In making this recommendation, the Neonatal Life Support Task Force acknowledges that most studies comparing later cord clamping with early cord clamping in late preterm or full-term infants delayed clamping of the cord for ≥60 seconds. Later cord clamping facilitates postnatal cardiovascular transition,181increases hemoglobin and hematocrit in the neonatal period, and improves iron status in early infancy. Although there were no studies that showed that later cord clamping prevented the complications of iron deficiency anemia or associated developmental delay, we value the benefits of increased hemoglobin and the potential for improved iron status to benefit neurodevelopment during the critical periods of early infancy. These potential benefits may be greatest in settings where resources for evaluation of nutritional status are limited and iron deficiency and anemia are prevalent.Later cord clamping is associated with increased rates of polycythemia and possible increase in the use of phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia. Although there was no reported increase in the rates of exchange transfusions, these considerations are important in settings where resources for evaluation and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia are limited.Only a few studies examined a physiological approach to cord clamping (delaying clamping until cessation of pulsation of the cord or on the basis of vital signs monitoring/initiation of breathing). Compared with early or time-based later cord clamping, this intervention improved neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit. However, the effect on iron status, anemia in infancy, or neurodevelopment is uncertain.Although cut-cord milking improves neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit, it is unknown whether the intervention facilitates the postnatal"

There are only a few small studies, and no long-term outcomes were addressed, limiting assessment of safety. Although cut-cord milking may be useful when later cord clamping is contraindicated or not feasible, no included studies report its use in these situations.There is insufficient evidence to recommend milking of the attached cord for term and late preterm infants.Across all comparisons, there was no evidence that any of the studied cord-management strategies improved the primary infant outcome of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment. Likewise, there was no evidence that cord-management strategies altered important maternal outcomes, including postpartum hemorrhage. The small sample size of most trials and the associated risks of bias and imprecision limited the certainty of evidence for all outcomes of interest. Analysis of many outcomes could not exclude benefits or harm.There have been historical and regional changes in cord-management practices over the past decades.230We acknowledge the perception of early clamping as a medical intervention and of later clamping as a natural, or physiological, approach and the paradox that many studies defined early clamping as the control.231As discussed with preterm cord clamping, current practices influence the recommendations, animal studies provide evidence that cardiovascular transition after birth occurs more effectively when cord clamping is deferred,181,290and societal, maternal, and practitioner preferences influence decisions about the timing of cord clamping.Later cord clamping is an inexpensive, readily available, universally applicable intervention that can be performed regardless of setting.233Many of the included studies did not record the exact time of cord clamping.

Devices that can effectively deliver PPV are critical to successful resuscitation.

The Neonatal Life Support Task Force reevaluated this topic with a ScopRev in 2020,291which identified sufficient new evidence to justify this new SysRev and reconsideration of current resuscitation guidelines (PROSPERO registration CRD42020200331).The full text of this CoSTR can be found online.292PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Newborn infants receiving PPV during resuscitation•Intervention and comparator (shown inTable 14)Table 14Comparison of PPV Devices in NewbornsComparisonInterventionComparator1T-piece resuscitatorSelf-inflating bag2T-piece resuscitatorFlow-inflating bag3Flow-inflating bagSelf-inflating bag4Self-inflating bag with PEEP valveSelf-inflating bag without PEEP valvePEEP indicates positive end-expiratory pressure; and PPV, positive-pressure ventilation.•Outcome: In-hospital mortality; severe intraventricular hemorrhage, Papile grade III to IV; intraventricular hemorrhage (any); bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); CPR or medications in the delivery room; air leak; intubation in the delivery room; duration of PPV in the delivery room; length of stay; admission to neonatal ICU•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligible for inclusion.

Animal studies suggest a benefit in using devices providing controlled levels of PEEP and peak inspiratory pressure to assist establishment of functional residual capacity during transition of a fluid-filled lung to an air-filled lung capable of supporting air breathing and to reduce lung damage secondary to barotrauma.299.,300.,301.Benchtop and manikin studies demonstrate more consistent pressures and tidal volumes when a T-piece resuscitator is used than when a self-inflating bag is used.302,303However, the certainty of clinical evidence is not sufficient to recommend against using a self-inflating bag during neonatal resuscitation, particularly in regions where pressurized gases are not readily available.Although subgroup analyses by gestation were not feasible, in contemporary neonatal practice, BPD is an outcome that affects mainly very preterm infants. Therefore, the reduction in the incidence of BPD suggests that the use of a T-piece resuscitator may be of greatest benefit for preterm infants.Knowledge Gaps•Evidence enabling comparison of benefits and risks of T-piece resuscitators with self-inflating bags by gestational age subgroups. Such studies should include outcomes relevant to each gestational age subgroup (eg, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, BPD, and neurodevelopmental impairment for very and extremely preterm infants; admission to neonatal intensive or special care unit, subsequent respiratory support, length of hospital stay, and air leaks for term and near-term infants).•Cost-effectiveness of routine use of T-piece resuscitators compared with self-inflating bags•Data on details of T-piece resuscitator and self-inflating bag use in practice (eg, pressures delivered, setup time, ease of use, adjustments to pressures made during use, perceived feedback from the device to the user)•How these PPV devices perform with the use of different patient interfaces (eg, face masks, laryngeal masks, tracheal tubes)•Evidence comparing the flow-inflating bag with either the T-piece resuscitator or the self-inflating bag (with or without PEEP) for neonatal resuscitation•Trials comparing one T-piece device with another and one self-inflating bag with another, although benchtop experiments demonstrate variations in performance that are of potential clinical importance.

    "full_text": "members (including siblings) or support people are encouraged or even allowed to attend the birth, especially if there is a high risk that the infant will need resuscitation.The architecture of birthing areas also varies widely. In some locations, neonatal resuscitation always takes place in the birthing room. In others, separate rooms adjacent to birthing rooms or operating rooms are used to optimize ambient temperature for the infant and to provide adequate room for a neonatal resuscitation team and all the equipment that may be needed for an advanced resuscitation. In the case of an infant who needs more BLS measures at birth, there is concern that the parents or other family members present could experience short- or long-term psychological distress.Concerns have also been raised about whether family presence could impede the performance of resuscitation team members and whether the neonatal resuscitation team members are present in sufficient numbers and have adequate training to support family members during a resuscitation. There is also concern that parents who are unaware of the circumstances of their infant’s resuscitation may feel left out of a critical time in their infant’s life and, in some situations, of the opportunities to contribute to key decisions about the extent of resuscitation.The Neonatal and Pediatric Life Support Task Forces conducted a combined SysRev of family presence during resuscitation (PROSPERO registration CRD42020140363).306The following summary describes the outcomes of the review applicable to newborn infants. The full CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.307PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Neonates requiring resuscitation in any setting•Intervention: Family presence during resuscitation•Comparator: No family presence during resuscitation•Outcome: Improved patient outcomes (short and long term), family-centered outcomes (short and long term, perception of the resuscitation), and health care provider–centered outcomes (perception of the resuscitation, psychological stress)•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies, qualitative) were eligible for inclusion.

Important themes included distinct aspects of fathers’ experience, parents’ feelings of reassurance and involvement if they were present, and concerns about the emotional toll of witnessing a resuscitation and the need for staff training in support of and debriefing for parents.For the important outcome of health care provider outcomes, 4 articles were identified. Two surveyed health care providers who had participated in a resuscitation with family present or in a delivery with all immediate care provided beside the mother for delayed clamping of the umbilical cord313,314and expressed concern that less experienced professionals may feel under increased pressure while being observed. A survey of parental opinion312found that some were concerned about impact on staff performance. One survey of health care providers found that the presence of a family member reduced perceived workload.308Overall, health care provider participants were professionals who were used to having parents in attendance and did not report any major detrimental effects.Treatment RecommendationsWe suggest that it is reasonable for mothers/fathers/partners to be present during the resuscitation of neonates when circumstances, facilities, and parental inclination allow (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).There is insufficient evidence to indicate an interventional effect on patient or family outcome. Being present during the resuscitation of their baby seems to be a positive experience for some parents, but concerns about an adverse effect on performance exist among both health care providers and family members.Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table can be found inSupplemental Appendix A3.In making these recommendations, the Neonatal Life Support Task Force considered that although family presence during neonatal resuscitation is practiced in some settings, it has never undergone a SysRev, and practice varies internationally. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some services have moved neonatal resuscitation sites to locations separated from parents, making this question a priority for the Neonatal Life Support Task Force.All of the included articles originated in the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada, and all were related to resuscitation and stabilization at birth.Mothers are always present at birth, and it seems that most health care providers surveyed consider that the presence of a partner or support person should be offered but with the caveat that facilitation and support of the families require enough personnel with adequate training.Of note, we did not identify any eligible RCTs or large cohort studies"

It is also notable that the evidence came from the opinions of only 144 parents and 350 health care providers in total, all sampled in tertiary centers in the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada.Task Force Knowledge Gaps•No studies provided adequate comparative data to address this PICO question in the setting of a neonate receiving resuscitation at birth or within the first month of life. Most studies used retrospective survey or qualitative methods and included births at which resuscitation was not required. There would be serious ethical constraints in performing an RCT to address this question, among which would be the difficulty in obtaining informed consent.

This SysRev intended to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of this educational approach in adults and children. Self-directed, digitally based BLS training was defined as any form of digital (eg, video, phone application [app] based, internet based, game based, virtual reality, augmented reality) education or training for BLS that can be completed without an instructor, except for mass media campaigns (eg, television, social media education). We defined instructor-led training as education or training (eg, lecture, skills demonstration, skills feedback) that occurred in the presence of a BLS instructor. Health care professional education was excluded, as were comparisons of different methods of digital training and BLS refresher courses (PROSPERO registration CRD42020199176).The full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.316PICO, Study Designs, and Time Frame•Population: Adults and children undertaking BLS training•Intervention: Self-directed, digitally based BLS training•Comparator: Instructor-led BLS training•Outcome: Patient outcomes: Good neurological outcome at hospital discharge/30 days; survival at hospital discharge/30 days; ROSC; rates of bystander CPR; bystander CPR quality during an OHCA arrest (any available CPR metrics); and rates of AED use.

Most individual studies were at critical risk of bias, primarily because of missing outcome data (RCTs) and potential for confounding (non-RCTs). Because of this and the high degree of heterogeneity in the interventions and in the measurements of outcomes, we performed a narrative synthesis of the findings for each outcome overall and by the different mediums of digital training tested.Critical Outcome: Subsequent Use of Skills and Patient OutcomesTwo RCTs326,349collected data on the use of BLS skills and patient outcomes after training.

There were no data for shorter durations.For the important outcome of hypothermia as an adverse effect of cooling burns, unpublished data from a study including 117 children provided very low– certainty evidence.360Five of 117 children (4%) with a thermal burn cooled with water as a first aid intervention developed hypothermia to 34 °C to 36 °C tympanic (n=4) or were visibly cold with shivering (n=1). All 5 children were <4 years of age, and 4 of 5 received whole-body cooling in a shower.Treatment RecommendationsWe recommend the immediate active cooling of thermal burns with running water as a first aid intervention for adults and children (strong recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).Because no difference in outcomes could be demonstrated with the different cooling durations studied, a specific duration of cooling cannot be recommended.Young children with thermal burns being actively cooled with running water should be monitored for signs or symptoms of excessive body cooling (good practice statement).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is provided inSupplemental Appendix A5.Cooling of burns with running water is an established and beneficial intervention, although suggested durations of cooling are variable and based largely on expert opinion.359,363.,364.,365.This has led to inconsistencies in international first aid guidance. The 2015 ILCOR CoSTR for cooling of burns provided a strong recommendation for active cooling of thermal burns with running water by first aid providers, but the duration of cooling was not specified.366,367It was suggested in task force insights that active cooling be started as soon as possible and continued for at least 10 minutes. Although several large human studies were identified in this 2021 SysRev, the evidence was found to be inconclusive to either support or refute the use of one duration compared with another. From an evidence-based perspective, the optimal technique (running water versus immersion) and the optimal temperature also remain unknown.It is the task force consensus opinion that the optimal duration of cooling may vary by burn location, size, and depth; interval between the burn and the start of cooling; and the temperature of the water used for cooling. This is supported by the sensitivity analysis, which did not show a dose-response relationship for cooling duration and outcomes. Because most patients included in the current analysis had a small burn area (mean total body surface area <5%) and most burns were superficial, the reason for the lack of association between a longer duration of cooling and outcome may have been a skewed population. A scatterplot comparing burn size and duration of burn cooling suggests that larger burns are associated with longer cooling durations, and the task force considered that this may be attributable to pain or concern for worse outcomes.

In the absence of science to guide duration of cooling, cooling until pain is relieved may be a commonly used first aid approach and one that deserves future research.A concern was raised that cooling of burns in young children might result in hypothermia. Evidence of this complication supports the good practice statement. Even a short cooling duration, especially if full-body cooling is used, may result in hypothermia.

Alternative rehydration options include 0% to 3.9% CEDs, water, coconut water, or skim or low-fat cow’s milk (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against rehydration with beer (0%–5% alcohol).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is provided inSupplemental Appendix A5.First aid providers are commonly recruited to assist at first aid stations located at sporting events, where exercise-induced dehydration is a common problem. It may not be possible to determine the exact quantity or percent of fluid loss in the first aid setting. The First Aid Task Force acknowledges that in cases of exertional dehydration, it is most important to rehydrate as soon as possible and emphasizes this priority as a good practice statement. The choice of what to drink will often be based on what the dehydrated person is willing to drink and what is palatable.We further acknowledge that all included trials conducted exercise in a controlled environment and duration. Extreme events such as ultramarathons were not included in the evidence evaluation.Although there is variability among the identified studies, we identified a beneficial effect with use of CEDs for many of the reviewed outcomes. Differences in cumulative urine output between beverages were discussed by the task force and are likely a result of beverage composition. Drinks with high energy content (ie, from carbohydrates, fat, protein, or alcohol) will empty from the stomach more slowly than drinks containing no energy. Therefore, they will potentially reduce or delay diuresis compared with water.Numerous studies were sponsored and financed by the manufacturers of the tested drinks. In many of these studies, a statement was included noting that the funders did not influence the study or results. In these cases, we did not downgrade for publication bias. In cases when such a statement was not provided, we downgraded for publication bias.Findings related to milk as a rehydration drink were also discussed at length by the task force. Skim or low-fat cow’s milk appears to have a water, energy, and macronutrient content similar to that of sports drinks.

The use of alcoholic beverages may have other unwanted effects, including a diuretic effect, and is not recommended for athletes in competition.Excessive fluid consumption may lead to an electrolyte imbalance. However, if clean, potable water is available, its cost, relative to CEDs, makes it an acceptable alternative, although water may require longer times to rehydrate and, in some cases, may be associated with hyponatremia.Task Force Knowledge Gaps•Whether medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension affect recommendations for rehydration drinks after exercise and dehydration•The ideal means of determining goals for rehydration in the first aid/sports settingPediatric Tourniquet Types (SysRev)Rationale for ReviewThe continuous evidence evaluation process for the production of this CoSTR started with a SysRev of first aid interventions for control of life-threatening bleeding391and a ScopRev of the use of tourniquets in the pediatric population (<19 years of age).392,393These reviews led to a recommendation for a SysRev, which was done on behalf of the First Aid and Pediatric Task Forces after registration on PROSPERO CRD42021229767.391The full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.394PICO, Study Design, and Time Frame•Population: Children (<19 years of age) with severe, life-threatening bleeding from an extremity wound•Intervention: Commercial elastic wrap tourniquet or commercial ratcheting tourniquet•Comparator: Commercial windlass rod-type tourniquet•Outcome: Mortality, control of bleeding (including surrogate outcome of obliteration of Doppler pulses), blood loss, shock/hypotension, and adverse events•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) and case series were eligible for inclusion.

The second study was conducted on 13 volunteers (2–7 years of age) with the same manufactured windlass rod tourniquet on an uninjured extremity while under anesthesia in an operating room.396Pooled data showed cessation of pulses in 71 of 71 upper extremities (100%) and in 69 of 73 lower extremities (94.5%). Tourniquet failures were attributable to an inability to continue secondary to pain in the unanesthetized group (n=1) and to an inability to occlude the distal pulse after a prespecified maximum of 3 windlass turns in the anesthetized group (n=3).395No evidence was identified for the outcomes of mortality, blood loss, and shock/hypotension.Treatment RecommendationsWe suggest the use of a manufactured windlass tourniquet for the management of life-threatening extremity bleeding in children (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).We are unable to recommend for or against the use of other tourniquet types in children because of a lack of evidence.For infants and children with extremities that are too small to allow the snug application of a tourniquet before activating the circumferential tightening mechanism, we recommend the use of direct manual pressure with or without the application of a hemostatic trauma dressing (good practice statement).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is provided inSupplemental Appendix A5.This topic was prioritized by the First Aid Task Force after a ScopRev392,393identified emerging evidence from human studies of tourniquet use in children. Previous reviews of adult and pediatric literature identified experimental studies of tourniquet use in pediatric models such as polyvinyl chloride pipes that demonstrated failure of adult tourniquets on smaller pipes.397In making this recommendation, the First Aid Task Force weighed the lack of direct evidence to show that tourniquets are a lifesaving intervention for life-threatening extremity bleeding in children against the previously established role of a manufactured windlass tourniquet in reducing mortality in adults with life-threatening extremity bleeding.391The Combat Application Tourniquet Generation 7 was the specific brand of windlass rod tourniquet used in both included studies, and the minimum limb circumference of the children included was 13 cm. Other windlass rod tourniquets may vary in their ability to tighten successfully on limbs with small circumferences.

    "full_text": "RCT, randomized controlled trial; and RR, risk ratio.Treatment RecommendationsWe recommend against the use of chemicals, heat, or ice compared with mechanical methods for the removal of a tick (strong recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).We suggest either pulling with tweezers or using commercial devices according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remove a tick rather than removal by hand (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework HighlightsThe evidence-to-decision table is provided inSupplemental Appendix A5.In making these recommendations, the First Aid Task Force considered that early removal of a tick is likely the most important aspect of preventing infection. We prioritized methods of tick removal that would be safe and effective while promoting early tick removal.Although studies differentiated adult and nymph ticks, different species of ticks, and time of tick attachment/engorgement, the task force acknowledged that it is impractical for lay providers to differentiate their features or the potential need for different devices for removal of each stage. Therefore, these studies were combined in this review.Tweezers are likely more readily available, have more first aid uses, and are less expensive than commercial tick-removal devices. They are therefore more practical for earlier tick removal than a commercial tick-removal device is.Although no study evaluated the proper grasp of the tick with tweezers, in the included studies, when described, ticks were grabbed as close to the skin as possible. The tweezers or forceps that were used were described as having a thin jaw, similar to Adson forceps, which would allow gripping of the tick near the skin without crushing the body.No studies evaluated disease transmission. Removal of a tick does not guarantee lack of disease transmission, and first aid guideline writers should consider including signs and symptoms of local and systemic illness after tick bites. All techniques of tick removal are subject to user error and could result in retained tick mouthparts in the skin.Task Force Knowledge Gaps•The most effective methods of tick removal by first aid providers•The effect of method of tick removal on clinical outcomes such as transmission of disease and local infectionUse of Cryotherapy for Acute Epistaxis in the First Aid Setting (ScopRev)Rationale for ReviewEpistaxis is typically managed in the first aid setting with direct manual pressure by pinching the nasal alae. Cryotherapy with ice/cold packs or ice collars is commonly recommended as adjunctive therapy for epistaxis on self-care web pages but is not recommended in first aid guidelines by ILCOR member organizations and has not been reviewed previously by ILCOR.

Six indirect experimental studies (all including adults without epistaxis) examined the effects of cryotherapy on nasal mucosal blood flow,410,411nasal submucosal temperature,412nasal blood volume,413nasal congestion and nasal cavity volume,414nasal airflow and patency,411and nasal airway volume.415An overview of all study characteristics and findings is presented inSupplemental Appendix C3. One randomized crossover study410of 16 adults reported a significant decrease in nasal mucosal blood flow (23% versus 5%;P<0.05) with ice packs inside the mouth compared with an ice pack applied to the forehead. A second randomized crossover study412of 13 adults reported a lower nasal submucosa temperature with sucking ice cubes compared with the application of ice packs to the forehead. The combination of sucking ice cubes and an ice pack to the forehead was reported to cause a greater drop in nasal submucosal temperature than an ice pack alone.An observational study of 56 healthy adults411reported no change in nasal mucosal microcirculatory blood flow or inspiratory airflow after 5 minutes of ice packs around the neck. A before-and-after study of 15 healthy adults also reported no significant change in nasal blood volume after a 10-minute application of an ice collar to the neck.One observational study414reported no significant difference in mean nasal cavity volume measurements up to 10 minutes after application of cold compresses to the nasal dorsal skin. An observational study415with 10 healthy adults reported greater nasal airway volume after ice-water immersion of the feet compared with 1 hand"

Despite a lack of supporting evidence, the review concluded that the application of an intraoral ice pack is a simple first aid measure with the potential to decrease bleeding severity.The gray literature review of cryotherapy in acute epistaxis identified 6 documents evaluating application of cryotherapy to the face or nose,417,418sucking on ice,417,419and application around417and to the back of the neck420or forehead (overview of these provided inSupplemental Appendix C3).421,422,422a,422bNo evidence for these recommendations was provided in 3 records.417,418,422A narrative review419suggested that ice packs around the neck and intraorally significantly reduced nasal mucosa blood flow and could slow bleeding. However, they referenced investigators410who measured nasal mucosal blood flow in healthy adults. Two narrative reviews420,421suggested that the use of cryotherapy is inconclusive and controversial, citing work by other investigators.411,413A review of ILCOR member councils for guideline documentation identified 2 subcouncil guidelines statements addressing epistaxis, including a 2000 American Heart Association guideline422aand a 2017 Australian and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation guideline.422bNo reference to cryotherapy was addressed in either guideline.Task Force InsightsThe gray literature recommendations for cryotherapy in the first aid management of acute epistaxis are based on findings of reduced nasal blood flow and volume reported in 3 of 6 indirect studies performed on healthy adults without epistaxis.410,412,413Cryotherapy application methods used in the studies were inconsistent and applied to the forehead, in the mouth, around the neck, on the feet, or on a single hand/forearm or a combination of locations. Cryotherapy application times also varied between studies. Gray literature recommendations for the use of cryotherapy in acute epistaxis are likely the result of opinion and the theory that cryotherapy induces vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. Current evidence does not support recommendations for use of cryotherapy as a first aid intervention for acute epistaxis.

In the context of cardiac arrest, there was concern that the transmissibility of COVID-19 may pose a risk to rescuers during delivery of chest compressions, defibrillation, and CPR. In view of this concern, ILCOR urgently commissioned a SysRev and developed treatment recommendations.423,424Subsequently, ILCOR has generated 4 EvUps to reflect the evolving COVID-19 literature and ongoing clinical interest. This summary describes evidence up to January 2021. The SysRev was registered on PROSPERO (registration CRD42017080475).Full text of this CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.425PICO, Study Design, and Time FrameOur SysRev addressed 3 complementary research questions in relation to COVID-19 and risk to the rescuer delivering CPR. Specifically, we examined aerosol generation (research question 1), transmission of infection (research question 2), and PPE strategy (research question 3). Research questions 1 and 2 evaluate the effect of an exposure on the outcome and thus differ in structure somewhat from the PICO because there is no true intervention or comparator.Research Question 1•Population: Individuals in any setting•Exposure: Delivery of chest compressions, defibrillation, CPR (all CPR interventions that include chest compressions)•Outcome: Generation of aerosols•Study design: RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies, case reports/series, cadaver studies) were eligible for"

CPR is a complex intervention with several components, including ventilation, defibrillation, chest compressions, and drug administration. The benefits of these interventions to the patient vary, as does the likely associated risk of infection transmission to the rescuer.A key consideration in developing treatment recommendations is the importance of rescuer safety. During chest compressions, aerosol generation is plausible because chest compressions generate passive ventilation associated with small tidal volumes.442Furthermore, the person performing chest compressions is in physical contact with the patient and in close proximity to the airway. We did not identify evidence that defibrillation either does or does not generate aerosols. If it occurs, the duration of an aerosol-generating process would be brief.In developing these treatment recommendations, the COVID-19 working group sought to carefully balance the benefit of early treatment with chest compressions and defibrillation (before donning PPE) with the potential harm to the rescuer, their colleagues, and the wider community if the rescuer were to be infected with COVID-19. We note that the vaccination status of the rescuer, patient, and the wider community may influence the potential for harm.ILCOR recognizes that the impact of COVID-19 will vary across regions and countries. In applying these treatment recommendations to their local context, regional and national resuscitation councils should consider the values and preferences of their local communities,"
