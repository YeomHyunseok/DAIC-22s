Denials in 6 medication classes were associated with net total medical spending increases ranging from $624 to $3016 in additional expense per member per year.MeaningThese findings suggest that although procedural prescription denials may aim to curb immediate drug costs, some denials may prompt heightened acute care utilization and expenses that outweigh the short-term prescription budget savings. BODY: IntroductionRising prescription medication costs in Medicaid have led to cost-containment measures by managed care plans, including procedural prescription denials.1These denials, which are more common in Medicaid than in other insurance types,2are often justified to prevent unnecessary spending within tight budgets. Common reasons for denial include early renewals, exceeded plan limits, noncovered drugs, or required prior authorization. Prior authorizations have been linked to pharmaceutical savings3and have been disproportionately studied despite being among the less common reasons for procedural prescription denials, compared with early renewals and plan limits on the number of pills per prescription. Whatever the reason for denial, some Medicaid patients may not obtain their chronic medications if their denials are not promptly resolved (eg, if clinicians do not communicate with pharmacies and resolve the denial, or if low-income patients [disproportionately receiving Medicaid] face competing demands for time or increased frustration that leads them to avoid returning to the pharmacy once they receive a denial).4This process is analogous to increased hospital use after patients face higher medication cost-sharing.5Despite theoretical cost-saving benefits, empirical research on the effect of procedural prescription denials on health care utilization and long-term costs is scarce. Older studies linked difficulties in obtaining psychiatric medications to adverse incarceration and institutionalization outcomes.6,7Recent studies from 2022 to 2024 have related narrow drug formularies and prior authorization requirements to patient inconvenience and reduced initiation of chemotherapies and substance use therapies, but not to comprehensive utilization and net cost outcomes at a population cohort level.8,9,10This knowledge gap persists amid speculation that denied patients may experience worsening chronic"

This hypothesis was informed by the understanding that medication adherence is crucial for managing chronic conditions and preventing acute exacerbations. Our research aimed to explore this hypothesis and contribute to the body of knowledge on outcomes associated with prescription denials, with the goal of informing Medicaid policy to optimize both health care costs and patient outcomes.MethodsThe Western Institutional Review Board deemed this cross-sectional study exempt from review because it involved the study of data recorded such that participants cannot be reasonably identified. Informed consent was waived for this study because it posed no harm to the patients. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.Study DesignMedicaid managed care plans frequently implement cost-containment tools for high-cost services and prescriptions. Patients with higher-cost services and prescriptions may be more likely to experience medication denials. To address the associated risk of confounding and reverse causality, we used the following methodologies. First, using claims from Medicaid patients in Virginia and Washington, we created a matched sample based on factors increasing the likelihood of medication denial, including demographics, comorbidities, and baseline primary and acute care utilization rates. We matched patients within each health plan to avoid confounding due to differences in services, geography, and populations. Second, within each matched sample, we measured the correlation between medication denials and prior acute care visits, to assess the risk of reverse causality. Third, we estimated the likelihood of an acute care event and the change in total spending related to each type of procedural prescription denial, after adjusting for confounders. We estimated this likelihood for each of the medication classes most commonly prescribed to Medicaid patients, as defined by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Prescription Drug Data Collection codes.15Finally, we verified that a medication denial did not indicate increased acute care visits for an unrelated condition (eg, motor vehicle accident), as opposed to acute care visits for conditions that were physiologically related to denial of the medication class, based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RxNav database."

The NIH RxNav database relates the lack of receiving a medication in a particular drug class to specific subsequent diseases or conditions (eg, being denied an asthma inhaler could plausibly result in an acute care utilization episode for an asthma exacerbation, but not for a broken leg) (eMethods inSupplement 1).16Clinical conditions were defined with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification Software Refined categories.17Data Source and Study PopulationWe analyzed data from a Medicaid patient population covered by 2 Medicaid health plans owned by different managed care companies and under different prescription denial policies, operating in 2 different states (Virginia and Washington). The dataset was a convenience sample based on data availability, as complete pharmaceutical denial information is rarely available compared with standard claims data. We included patients with at least 1 pharmacy claim during our study period. We focused on the 20 most commonly prescribed medication classes out of a total of 390, which accounted for 49.3% of all prescriptions (202 952 of 411 667) in the dataset. Our data sources comprised demographic and eligibility information (age, sex, and months of eligibility), inpatient and outpatient claims (including hospitalizations and ED visits), and pharmaceutical claims (encompassing both paid and denied pharmacy claims, along with the reason for denial). The prestudy period spanned July 1 to December 31, 2022, and the study period extended from January 1 to July 31, 2023. Given the high disenrollment rates from Medicaid health plans,18we required a minimum of 3 months of enrollment during the prestudy period and at least 6 months during the study period to ensure adequate prescription and utilization records for analysis (eMethods inSupplement 1). Data missingness for key variables was assessed according to the standards defined by the Medicaid DQ (Data Quality) Atlas,19with all variables missing at levels below the threshold for low concern. Missing data were not imputed, and no case patients were removed, as health plan data were complete. However, data from both states have specific mental health or substance use diagnoses bundled as behavioral health in the medical claims data. Following previous literature,18we excluded individuals dually enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid due to the unavailability of pharmaceutical claims from Medicare and to the fact that Medicare pharmacy coverage and denial policies vary based on supplemental coverage rules, whereas our study question related to those patients specifically solely covered by Medicaid.Exposure and Control GroupsFor each medication class, we assigned patients to either the exposure group (defined as having â‰¥1 denial for a given medication class during the study period) or the comparison group (defined as having 0 denials for that class).

We evaluated the similarity of the matched sample on observed covariates by estimating the standardized mean difference of each covariate across the matched patients.Outcome VariablesWe identified our primary outcome variable as all-cause acute care events (a hospitalization or ED visit) occurring within a 60-day window following a medication fill attempt for both denials and successful fills, to be concordant with existing pharmacoepidemiology literature attempting to capture the typical time to exacerbation across a wide variety of medication classes.26We defined ED visits based onCurrent Procedural Terminologycodes (99281-99285), revenue codes (0450-0459 and 0981), or place-of-service codes (code 23). To count episodes of care, we linked ED visits and inpatient claim records for the same patient if their dates of service overlapped or immediately followed one another, to count as a single acute care episode if the ED visit resulted in an inpatient hospitalization.27Secondary outcomes included ED visits alone and acute care visits by medication classâ€“principal diagnosis combination. We also evaluated the tertiary outcome of the net cost to the health plan attributable to the denial. This was defined as the combined cost of acute care visits related to the denial (calculated using paid amounts and typical claim payment rates) and the total medical cost relevant to the condition incurred during the 60-day period following the denial, minus the cost that would have been incurred had the prescription been approved. The latter was based on the mean and variation in paid amounts for prescriptions within that medication class. All costs were computed in 2023 US dollars.Descriptive AnalysisFor each medication class, we calculated the percentages of total medication fills, denied medication fills, and denied medication fills associated with an acute care event within 60 days following the medication fill attempt.

Finally, we measured the unadjusted spending (per member per year [PMPY]) for the first denied medication claim followed by an acute care event within 60 days.Statistical AnalysisFor each medication class, using the matched sample, we calculated an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and adjusted difference in each outcome between patients in the exposure group vs the comparison group, conditional on age, sex, health plan, and prestudy number of chronic conditions (defined by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index), all-cause acute care visits, primary care visits, and eligibility months. The 95% CI for the AOR did not include 1 (P< .05). To assess the risk of false-positive results, we examined whether medication denials were associated with more acute care visits for a condition unrelated to the denied medication (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accidental injury codes).28To ensure stable estimates, we focused on medication classes with at least 5 injury-related acute care visits 60 days after a medication fill or denial. Furthermore, as a sensitivity analysis, we measured the E value for each estimate29to quantify the size of unmeasured confounding needed to neutralize the main outcome results.To assess generalizability, we compared the characteristics of our sample to the national Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) data for patients in Washington and Virginia, as well as to the national sample.30Additionally, we evaluated the frequency of the 20 most commonly prescribed medications in our sample against these benchmarks. Finally, we conducted a series of analyses to evaluate the prevalence of medication substitutions, the extent to which patients had medications across multiple classes, and the number of denials that did not result in an acute care visit.The main results are presented across all patients for the matched sample, with the unmatched analysis presented in eTables 2, 15, and 16 and subgroup analyses by state presented in eTables 18 and 19 inSupplement 1.

Of the 7 medication classes, 6 were associated with net total medical spending increases due to denial (ranging from $624 to $3016 PMPY for total medical spending). The results were consistent across 2 independent Medicaid health plan populations, with sensitivity analyses revealing low risks for the findings to be driven by unmeasured confounding (given E values >2) or bias from differential risk of acute care utilization among patients receiving more denials (given our matching approach and null findings for reversal causality or diagnoses physiologically unrelated to the medication denial). Based on the experiences of clinicians on our team, for biguanides, NSAIDs, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, and corticosteroids, denials often result in higher costs without an increase in acute care events, as outpatient clinicians commonly substitute the denied medication with a more expensive alternative. In contrast, for histamine-1 receptor antagonists, patients often go without a substitute, leading to utilization avoidance. These findings can inform policy decisions, as Medicaid managed plans determine formulary, coverage, prior authorization requirements, claim denials and approvals, and payments based on drug classes.Previous research in the Medicaid population has explored the effects of narrow drug formularies and prior authorization requirements on patient inconvenience and reduced initiation of new therapies. Prior authorizations have been linked to prescription drug cost savings3but also to treatment delays.8,9,10However, our study quantified that early refills and high pills per prescription were the most common reasons for denials, with prior authorizations being a minority of causes despite being more extensively studied. Additionally, several common antibiotics, behavioral health medications (eg, antidepressants), and agents for preventing exacerbations of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions (eg, asthma inhalers and heart disease or stroke drugs) had the highest increases in acute care utilization upon denial. Hence, although procedural denials are presumed to lower health care spending, the findings of our study suggest that some denials may perversely increase acute care utilization and costs. Medicaid health plans should consider these findings when formulating prescription coverage policies. Our analysis also suggests intervention possibilities, such as prioritizing certain pharmaceutical denials for quicker resolution to prevent adverse outcomes.LimitationsOur analysis has several limitations. First, although our sample may not be fully generalizable to the national Medicaid population, comparisons with national T-MSIS data suggest that our patient sample was comparable to"

Second, our patient-level data were limited, although we used matching methods and conducted sensitivity analyses to mitigate bias. For example, our data did not include individual-level social determinants of health characteristics, such as transportation access or food security, which have been shown to affect acute care utilization.18Third, our analysis may not capture certain secondary effects of prescription denials, such as complex drug-drug interactions or the impact of therapeutic substitutions. For instance, an interaction between a statin and a proton pump inhibitor could lead to the denial of the proton pump inhibitor to enhance the statinâ€™s effectiveness, potentially preventing an acute care event. Conversely, a denial of phenytoin alongside the blood thinner warfarin could lower warfarin levels, resulting in a blood clot and triggering an acute care event. Fourth, data on the reasons for prescription denials were available only for patients in Virginia, not for those in Washington, which may limit the scope of our findings. Fifth, the bundling of mental health or substance use diagnoses in our data could affect the precision of linking specific medication classes to behavioral health outcomes. Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the largest evaluation to date that links pharmaceutical denials with acute care events and associated spending.ConclusionsIn this cross-sectional study of 19 725 Medicaid patients across 2 states, certain procedural prescription denials were associated with increased acute care events and net costs across several medication types. Although procedural denials were typically presumed to reduce health care spending, some were associated with higher acute care utilization and costs. Medicaid health plans should consider these findings when formulating prescription coverage policies. Future research should systematically review all medication classes across plans nationally."
