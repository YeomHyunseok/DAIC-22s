Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a hallmark critical care intervention that is strongly associated with cognitive decline.Methods:We subjected double transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (Adtg) (APP/PSEN1) and wild-type (WT) mice to MV for 4 hours and compared to spontaneously breathing (SB) controls. Cerebral soluble/insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurological and systemic markers of inflammation were quantified. Hippocampal blood-brain barrier permeability was quantified using a novel methodology that enabled assessment of small and large molecule permeability across the blood-brain barrier. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the regional relationship between amyloid-β1–40 and acute vascular disruption and neuronal injury.Results:See imageConclusions:Short-term MV resulted in increased cerebral soluble Aβ1-40 and increased cerebral TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations. BBB permeability and neuronal injury were decreased in mechanically ventilated ADtg mice, whereas BBB permeability and neuronal injury were increased in mechanically ventilated WT mice compared to their respective SB controls. There was increased distribution of Aβ1-40 in regions of acute vascular disruption, resulting in lower BBB permeability. Overall, these results support a possible physiological role for Aβ1-40 to decrease BBB permeability and neuronal injury during the acute stress of MV, however it is expected that long-term sustained of this putative protective pathway will contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.Fig. 1 (abstract P001).(1) Representative images from ADtg mouse showing markedly increased distribution of Aβ1-40 in a “banding” pattern within a region of acute vascular disruption.

Rats were euthanized and brain homogenates were made. Content of the phosphorylated (inactivated form) of the GSK-3 beta enzyme and key antioxidant enzymes (hemoxygenase, superoxide dismutase, catalase) in rat brain homogenates was assessed by western - immunoblotting. Statistica 6.0, parametric methods were used for data analysis.Results:The research results showed that xenon inhalation anesthesia resulted in a 2-fold increase of the phosphorylated (inactivated form) of the GSK-3 beta enzyme (р<0.05); increased the content of the key antioxidant enzymes (hemoxygenase (by 50%, р<0.05), superoxide dismutase (by 60%, р<0.05), catalase (by 20%, р>0.05) in rat brain homogenates compared to the controls.Conclusions:An increase of the phosphorylated GSK-3 beta enzyme and pool of antioxidant enzymes (hemoxigenase, superoxide dismutase, catalase) in the brain under the xenon anesthesia was proved which suggests a new molecular mechanism for the realization of its neuroprotective properties and has a great clinical outlook.P004 Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein are not increased in ventriculostomy-related infections in patients with hemorrhagic strokeS Wang, E Pietrzko, E Keller, G BrandiUniversity Hospital Zurich, Neurocritical Care Unit, Dept. of Neurosurgery and Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, Zurich, SwitzerlandIntroduction:Ventriculostomy-related infection (VRI) is a serious complication in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. In such patients, diagnosis of VRIs is complicated by blood contamination of CSF following ventricular hemorrhage. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of white blood cells count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to identify VRIs in patients with hemorrhagic stroke during the time of external ventricular drain (EDV) in situ.Methods:This retrospective study was conducted at the Neurosurgical-ICU, University Hospital of Zurich.

Of those, 14 patients with VRIs (“VRI”), defined by positive CSF bacterial culture and increased WBC in CSF (>250/ul), and 115 patients without VRIs and with serial CSF sampling (“no-VRI”) were analyzed. Patients with CSF-contamination or suspected VRI (negative CSF cultures but antibiotic treatments) were excluded. WBC, CRP, and PCT were measured daily. CSF was sampled routinely twice a week or by T>38°C. For the analysis, mean peak values of WBC, CRP, PCT during the time of EVD in situ were compared between groups (t test). Data are expressed as mean with CI 95%.Results:Between groups, WBC and CRP were similar (WBC: 15.13 G/L and 14.55 G/L, p=0.68 and CRP: 115.93 mg/l and 129.44 mg/l, p=0.56 in the group VRI and no-VRI, respectively) (Figure 1, panel A and B).

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) usually present with a severe disease and organ failure, leading to high mortality and morbidity.Methods:We have performed a retrospective analysis during a 5-year period of patients admitted to a polyvalent ICU. Clinical, demographic and outcome data were collected to evaluate its clinical impact on the outcome of patients with CNS infections.Results:We identified 30 patients with the diagnosis of meningitis, meningoencephalitis and ventriculitis, where the median age was 57,6 years (range 24-80). Upon clinical presentation, their most frequent signs were fever (70%), meningeal signs (40%), seizures (30%), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score <8 (66%). All needed ventilation support and 66% needed cardiovascular support. A definitive microbiological diagnosis was achieved on 22 patients and antibiotic therapy was adjusted on 18 of them. Most common microorganisms wereStreptococcus pneumoniae(n=7),Listeria(n=5) andPseudomonas aeruginosa(n=4) (Figure 1). Other gram negative microorganisms were detected and lead to more adverse outcomes. Meningitis was the cause of admission on 26 patients and on a minority (n=4) meningitis was considered to be a secondary diagnosis on patients admitted for other causes (traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage,"

Duration of UWS was 2-4 month. Selenium blood level was performed once every 10 days for 30 days (three times on the whole). After first blood level measurement, 46 patients (27 TBI and 19 hypoxia) received sodium selenite pentahydrate (Selenase) at a dose of 6 mkg / kg / day for 7 days; In 8 patients (4 TBI and% hypoxia, selenase was not administrated (control group).Results:In patients who were treated with selenase, maximum concentration of selenium was observed on the 20th day and was on 34.74% higher on average than in the initial study. In the initial study, the average value in patients with hypoxia was 24.24 ± 10.90 mkg/l, the maximum value was 61.30 mkg/l, between 2-9 days 28.83 ± 15.46 mkg/l (max 70.00 mkg/l), from 10-19 day - 30.22 ± 8.54 mkg/l (max 50.70 mkg/l), from 20-30 days 34.76 ± 16.75 mkg/ l (57.10 mkg/l). At the first measurement the average value in patients with a consequence of TBI was 24.81 ± 8.83 mkg/l, maximum value was 53.00 mkg/l, between 2-9 days 39.26 ± 12.39 mkg/l (max 64.50 mkg/l), from 10-19 day - 37.41 ± 12.88 mkg/l (max 59.50 mcg/l), from 20-30 days 37.35 ± 12.75 mcg/l (max 64.30 mcg/l). Original selenium blood level are 23-190 mkg/l. The average value of the initial values in the control group was 21.4 ± 1.6, mkg/l on day 30 in the control group 17.8 ± 3.8 mkg/l.Conclusions:Therapy with selenase showed a statistically significant increase of selenium blood concentration (p = 0.00) compared with the control group. Selenase administration did not show a statistically significant value on severity of SIRS process. Average values of selenium levels did not depend on the etiology of brain damage in UWS patients.Funding :The study was funded by RFBR project number 19-29-01066/2019P007 Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in critically ill patients with"

Six blood samples were taken during a dose interval at steady state and LEV was quantified by HPLC. A population PK study was carried out. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the differences in PK between patients with and without ARC. The suitability of drug concentrations was also assessed.Results:Seventeen patients were included, 13 with normal creatinine clearance (CrCL) (80-129 mL/min) and 4 with CrCl≥130 mL/min (ARC). Ten patients received 500mg q12h, one 1000mg q12h and two 1500mg q12h. The data were best fitted to a two-compartment model. Figure 1 shows LEV concentrations during the dosing interval. Mean clearance (CL) was 4 L/h and mean volume of distribution of central compartment (V) was 44 L. Interindividual variability was 38 and 61% for CL and V, respectively. No differences were identified between both groups (p>0.05) in PK parameters. No correlation was found between LEV CL and CrCL. Trough levels were below the minimum concentration (Cmin) 12 mg/L of the therapeutic range in all patients except 1. Furthermore, between 3-5 h 50% of samples were below the Cmin.Conclusions:Administered doses were not able to maintain LEV concentrations in the recommended therapeutic range. Other dosage strategies, such the extension of infusion time with higher doses, could be evaluated in order to obtain a more favourable profile. No correlation between LEV CL and CrCL was found.AcknowledgementsWe thank the Department of Education of the Basque Government (PIBA 2019-57) and the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU (PPG17/65, GIU 17/32) for their financial support.References:1.

    "full_text": "Care Medicine and Rehabilitology, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:The mechanical properties of muscles such as tone, elasticity, and stiffness are often affected in chronic critical ill (CCI) patients. A hand-held device known as the MyotonPRO demonstrated acceptable relative and absolute reliability in a ward setting for patients with acute stroke [1]. The technology works on the principle of applying multiple short impulses over the muscle bulk via the testing probe. The aim of our study is to assess the feasibility of objective measurement of muscle tone in CCI patients with neurological dynamics and serum biomarkers.Methods:The study included 23 CCI patients with neurological disorders (stroke, traumatic brain injury, neurosurgical intervention for brain tumors) with more than a 3-weeks stay in ICU. Dynamic measurements of the muscle properties were taken on the deltoideus, brachioradialis, quadriceps femoris, gastrocnemius using the MyotonPRO. To identify the leading factor in impaired muscle tone also were measured neurological (S100, NSE), inflammatory (IL-6), bacterial load (PCT) biomarkers using Elecsys immunoassay and the serum level of microbial metabolites using GC-MS (Thermo Scientific).Results:All patients were divided into groups depending on positive and negative clinical dynamics. Significant differences were obtained in parameters characterizing changes in muscle tone of lower limbs - Fgastrocnemius(tone) -15.5 vs 18.5 Hz, Rquadriceps femoris(the mechanical stress relaxation time) - 16.5 vs 13.6 ms (p < 0.01, respectively). Some significant correlations between five parameters of muscle tone biomarkers and microbial metabolites were revealed.Conclusions:The results of a quantitative measurement of muscle tone objectively reflect the dynamics of neurological status, which in the future may be promising technique for the personalized approach CCI in patients.References:1.

Temperature decrease in neuronal cells is a strong signal that triggers endogenic cytoprotection programs using early response genes expression. Our goal is to determine influences of craniocerebral hypothermia (CCH) on level of consciousness in CCI patients.Methods:We examined 98 patients with different types of brain injuries. 54 males and 44 females, mean age 45.56 ±16.03. Patients were divided into 2 groups: main group - 47 patients (Vegetative State (VS) – 28, minimally conscious state (MCS) – 19), comparison group – 51 patient (VS – 32, MCS –19), groups were equal on main parameters (severity, functional state, comorbidity). Patients from main group received courses of CCH, duration -180 minutes, scalp temperature 5-8 °С, cerebral cortex cooling up to 32-34oC, session end was without slow reheating period, and session’s amount was set - until signs of consciousness recovery. Cortex temperature check done noninvasively by using detection of brain tissue EMI in SHF- range. Consciousness recovery in VS and MCS patients controlled using CRS-R scale.Results:CCH sessions significantly increased level of consciousness in VS and MCS patient groups. In VS patients vegetative state increased until minimally conscious state and MCS +, and in MCS group until lucid consciousness (p <0.05) (Figure 1).Conclusions:Craniocerebral Hypothermia is used in chronically critically ill patients for the first time.

PRISM III score and neurological assessment, including level of consciousness assessed using the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) score were determined. PI and RI of the middle meningeal artery were done on both sides using TCD to all included patients.Results:The study showed that mean PI and RI values of the septic critical cases were significantly higher than those of the control group, CVR increases with the more deepening of coma (the decline in FOUR score). Cerebral CO2 reactivity in septic patients were found disturbed. There were positive correlations between both PI and RI and PaCO2 with high significance.Conclusions:Cerebrovascular resistance is increased in cases of sepsis - associated encephalopathy.

We assessed the significance of automated pupillometry for the identification of BE patients after LVO-EVT.Methods:We enrolled 40 patients admitted to our neurocritical-care unit who received EVT after anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. We monitored parameters of pupillary reactivity [light-reflex latency (Lat; s), constriction and re-dilation velocities (CV, DV; mm/s), and percentage change of apertures (per-change; %)] using a portable pupilometer (NeurOptics®) up to every 60 minutes during the first 72 hours of ICU stay. BE was defined as midline-shift ≥5mm on follow-up imaging within 3-5 days after EVT. We assessed differences in pupillary reactivity between patients with and without BE (U-test) and evaluated prognostic performance of pupillometry for development of BE (ROC analysis).Results:In 32 patients (19 women, 74.3±12.0 years) without BE, 1,224 assessments were compared to 207 assessments in 6 patients (3 women, 71.7±11.8 years) with BE. On day 1, day 2, and day 3 after EVT, patients with BE had significantly lower CVs and DVs, and smaller per-changes than patients without BE, whereas Lat did not differ between both groups.

In this study we set out our experience with trancranial color-coded duplex ultrasound (DXT) [1]. The DXT study identifies cerebral arteries as well as hemorrhagic phenomenon, hydrocephalus, mass-occupying lesions and midline shift. This is the main difference between DXT and conventional Transcranial Doppler (DTC) which is a blind study and do not provide any image.Methods:Descriptive, cross-sectional and observational study from December 2018 to June 2019. 21 patients were included. Inclusion criteria: Neurocritical patients. Exclusion criteria: No acoustic window, presence of ultrasound artifacts. Data collection was performed. It was used a low-frequency transducer from 1.5-3.5 MHz with trancranial duplex preset (Figure). The patterns were defined as normal, vasospasm, high resistance, hypermedia and cerebral circulatory arrest, depending on the cerebral flow velocity, Lindegaard Ratio (LR) and Pulsatility Index (IP).Results:12 men (57.1%) and 9 women (42.9%). Average age 55.6(20-79). Patients diseases: Subarachnoid hemorrhage 6, traumatic brain injury 5, AV malformation 4, stroke 2, hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident 2 and mass occupying lesions 2.

Anaesthesiologist can use deliberate hypotension to reduce blood flow through AVM which may be somehow helpful to prevent this scenario. Adenosine-induced cardiac arrest may facilitate the embolization too. The goal of our study was to improve the results of endovascular treatment of AVM using adenosine-induced cardiac arrest.Methods:After obtaining informed consent 13 patients (8 male, 5 female) were selected for adenosine-induced cardiac arrest during endovascular AVM embolization. Main age was 40,8±6 years old. 9 of them were evaluated as III class ASA, 4 as IV. Endovascular treatment in all cases was performed under general anaesthesia. Propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium were used to induce anaesthesia, then all the patients were intubated and ventilated with parameters to keep EtCO2 32-35 mm Hg. Sevoflurane 2,1-2,6 vol% (12 cases) or desflurane 6 vol% (1 case) were used to maintain anaesthesia. Hemodynamic monitoring consisted of ECG, pulsoximetry, non-invasive blood pressure measurement. Onyx or/and Squid were used as embolic agents. CT was performed to every patient just after procedure as well as neurological examination.Results:Adenosine dosage was 0.875-1.26 mg/kg. Time of consequent cardiac arrest was 10-40 sec. There were 10 cases we administered adenosine for 1 time, in one case we had to administer it twice, in one - 3 times and 4 times in one more case as well.

To treat AF anticoagulation is needed. There are now several anticoagulants available. However, a lack of head to head data as well as the absence of accurate techniques makes it difficult to compare them and measure determine there efficacy. Stroke is known to produce an abnormal clot microstructure which is a common factor in many thrombotic diseases. This pilot study aims to use a functional biomarker of clot microstructure (df) and clotting time (TGP) to investigate the therapeutic effects of different anticoagulants in stroke and AF.Methods:We recruited 114 patients (59 AF and 55 stroke & AF). Two samples of blood were taken: before anticoagulation (baseline) and post anticoagulation (6-10weeks). Patients were either given warfarin (31%) or axipaban (69%). dfand TGP were measured and compared before and after anticoagulation.Results:Warfarin increased TGP(267±56 secs to 332±78 secs (p<0.05)), and decreased df(1.71±0.05 to 1.65±0.06 (p<0.05)). Apixaban increased TGP (235±66 sec to 410±105 sec (p<0.05)) but did not change df (1.72±0.04 & 1.72±0.05).

Maximal early lactate is associated with increased risk for poor outcome [2]. We investigated whether the combination of both HAIR-score and early abnormal lactate (<24h), gives a better association with mortality after spontaneous SAH.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study at a tertiary university hospital, data was collected for all patients with spontaneous SAH during a period of eleven years (2007-2017). Multiple binary logistic regression models were fitted for each outcome (ICU mortality and hospital mortality). The first one included the individual components of the HAIR-score, the second model also included an indicator for abnormal (>18 mg/dl) lactate within the first 24h (La-HAIR-score). In addition, two simple binary logistic regression models were fitted as continuous covariates: The HAIR-score (theoretical range 0-8) and the La-HAIR-score, with one extra point to patients with abnormal lactate concentration (theoretical range 0-9). These models were compared with a likelihood ratio test and Nagelkerke’s R² test.Results:A total of 470 patients were included. In our sample, not all original HAIR components were associated with ICU or hospital mortality. The multiple logistic regression model of the La-HAIR-score had a significantly better fit to the data, compared to the original HAIR-score. The p-value of the likelihood ratio test was 0.01 for ICU mortality and 0.025 for hospital mortality. A score of 8 on the La-HAIR-score had a 100% specificity for both ICU and in-hospital mortality.Conclusions:Combination of HAIR-score and abnormal lactate within the first 24h, the La-HAIR-score, significantly improved the model fit for ICU and hospital mortality compared to the model with the original HAIR-score.References:1.

A. Fernandez, NeuroICU, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaIntroduction:Urapidil is an antihypertensive, vasodilatory drug with no tachycardia or increased ICP effect. Recommended for neurocritical patients in European and Asian guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of injectable urapidil for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in neurocritical patients.Methods:We carried out a prospective study of 175 cases in 2 South American Neuro ICU (Chile and Argentina), with clinical and biological monitoring. Treatment was initiated if the blood pressure was higher than 180/110mmHg with organ disfunction. Efficacy was defined as a lowering of blood pressure to 150/100 mmHg or below. The drug was administered according to protocol by IV bolus (by PVC) followed by continuous infusion. Sex, age, SAP, MAP, DAP and CR were evaluated at the beginning and end of bolus therapy, as well as response to the drug at 5, 10, 15 minutes, and maintenance dose. Statistical analysis: Wilcoxon test for paired samples.Results:175 patients (average age : 63). Ischemic stroke (86), ICH (59), SAH (16), HELLP / PEE (5), ACS (3), HE (2). Changes in SAP (198 to 130), DAP (116 to 78) and MAP (155 to 94) (p two tails <0.001) (Figure 1). No significant changes in CR (median 76 to 72). 9 deaths, none attributable to administration of urapidil. 124 (71%) responded to 1st dose at 5 min, 50 (28%) to 2nd dose at 10 min and 1 (1%) required a 3rd dose at 15 min. All responded favourably. Urapidil was effective in all cases, with a significant decrease in BP. 99% within 10 minutes. There was no lack of response or complications.Conclusions:Injectable urapidil seems to be an antihypertensive agent that is easy to use and effective in all the cases of this first South-American experience.

Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with DCI.Results:A total of 224 patients were included in the analysis (female male ratio 141/83, median age 57 [47-65] years). Multivariate analysis was adjusted on sedation, intracranial surgery, Fisher classification of SAH severity, pneumonia occurrence and non-pneumonia infectious event occurrence (Figure 1). Pneumonia occurred in 66 patients (29.5%) and other causes of infections in 45 patients (20.1%). DCI was found in 108 patients (48.2%).

One of the targets for pathogenetic influence on the course of TBI is the use of pharmacological agents that are able to counteract the negative effects of excess concentrations of glucocorticoids on brain.Methods:The therapeutic effect of new pharmacological derivative 1-adamantylethyloxy-3-morpholino-2-propanol hydrochloride (ademol) in rats with TBI was evaluated for 8 days. The pseudoperated animals and control group received 0.9% NaCl solution and the comparison group received amantadine sulfate. Cortisol levels were used to determine the efficacy of the test drugs in TBI.Results:In rats treated with ademol, the level of cortisol in the blood ranged from 179 to 188 ng/ml (P5-P95) and was 2.58-fold lower (p<0.05) compared to control pathology group on the 8 day of therapy. Instead, the effect of amantadine sulfate on the level of cortisol in the blood was significantly less than that of ademol. The concentration of cortisol in rats with amantadine sulfate in the blood ranged from 271-280 ng/ml (P5-P95), was 1.73 times lower (p<0.05), compared with the control pathology group, and by 49.2% (p<0.05) exceeded the corresponding value in animals treated with ademol.Conclusions:Therapeutic treatment of rats with severe TBI with a solution of ademol, preferably better than rats in the group with 0.9% NaCl and amantadine sulfate protect the brain from the formation of steroid neurotoxicity by cortisol (p<0.05).References:1.

The aim of the study is to assess how plasma and cerebrospinal levels of YKL-40 [2], independently or in combination with NSE, IL-6, TNF-α and CRP affect the clinical models and the outcome in TBI.Methods:30 patients with isolated severe TBI admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital “St. George”- Plovdiv from 2017 to 2018 were included. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were collected on the 24thand 96thhour after the injury. CSF samples were also collected from 15 adult cadavers and served as an age-matched and gender-matched control group. Levels of YKL-40, NSE, IL-6 and TNF-α were analyzed with ELISA. GCS, APACHE III and Marshall Classification were determined prior to randomization and at the 96thhour after admission. Outcome was assessed as in-hospital mortality and at six months mortality.Results:The CSF level of YKL-40 in the TBI group was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.005). CSF levels of NSE are significantly higher compared to plasma concentrations on 24-thhour in TBI patients. Mean plasma levels of YKL-40 and TNF-α were higher compared to CSF, but the difference was feeble. We found statistically significant difference in plasma levels of YKL-40 (p<0.001) and NSE (p<0.001) in patients with short survival. A significant correlation between plasma concentrations of YKL-40, TNF-α and NSE was determined.Conclusions:Plasma NSE concentration is the major independent variable which influenced the survival of TBI patients. Plasma and CSF YKL-40 levels along with NSE, reflect the inflammatory process and would provide new information about its dynamics in TBI patients.Acknowledgements: The financial support by the National Science Fund of Bulgaria (Contract DM 03/2 12.12.2016) is gratefully acknowledged.References:1.

We therefore hypothesized that a simplified model of variation between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure ICP over the first three days of admission would have been able to predict patient outcome: we call this new parameter Cerebrovascular Pressure Correlation index (CPC).Methods:We performed a retrospective observational study of all adult patients with severe TBI admitted to ICU from January 2017 to April 2018 inclusive. All consecutive patients with a clinical need for ICP monitoring were included for analysis. Both for ICP and MAP data were mean value over 2-hours registration, for a total of 12 observations/day, CPC was therefore calculated as the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between ICP values (x axis) and MAP values (y axis), obtaining one single value every 24 hours. Variables included in the model (i.e. CPC, CPP, ICP, systemic glucose, arterial lactate, PaCO2, ICP, and internal body temperature) were collected for the first 3 days since trauma.Results:For the main outcome only the minimum value of CPC fit the regression analysis (P = 0.004). The correspondent ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.80. The associated Youden criterion was ≤0.26 (Sensitivity = 0.90; Specificity = 0.68). Of all the variables considered for the secondary outcome only CPCmin fit the regression model (P =0.03).

In this study we depicted the dynamic response of HRV to iatrogenic interventions.Methods:Prospectively collected high resolution data of patients from multiple centers with severe TBI from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) cohort of the CENTER-TBI study were analyzed. Bad outcome was defined as having a Glasgow-Outcome-Scale GOSE between 1-3 at 6 months. HRV parameters were calculated according to international guidelines using a 5-minute sliding window, updated every 10s. Hourly and daily medians were further analyzedResults:We included 273 patients (11403 h analyzed).80% were male, 46±19 years old and had an initial GCS of 6 (IQR 3-10). 72 had at least one unresponsive pupil. Outcome data was available for 90.1% of patients with 50.8% (N=125/246) having a bad outcome. The ratio of LF (low frequency) to HF (high frequency) power (LF/HF ratio) was lower in patients with at least one unreactive pupil (1.2±1.1 vs.1.5±1.3, p=0.03) and who had a bad outcome (1.1±0.9)vs. good outcome (1.8±1.4) (mean difference 0.69; 95%CI 0.38-0.99, p<0.001) suggesting parasympathetic dominance. During deep sedation we found a lower LF/HF Ratio (0.9±1.1 vs.1.6±1.7, p<0.001), a lower heart rate standard deviation(HR-SD)(p<0.001) and root mean square of successive differences heartbeats(RMSSD) (p=0.006), compared to patients that were not suppressed. During 151 sedation boli the HR-SD increased (mean diff.0.71 95%CI 0.9-0.4, p<0.002) compared to baseline (30min before bolus). During days with induced hypothermia (63d-mild hypothermia; 23d≤35°C, N=42) the LF/HF Ratio was lower (1.6±1.7 vs 1.1±1.1, p=0.02), as were the HR-SD(p=0.01)&RMSSD (p=0.01).Patients with a good outcome but not those with poor outcome showed increased RMSSD during suctioning(reflecting better vagal response) (Figure 1).Conclusions:HRV reflects severity and ICU interventions.

It is unclear how dynamic changes in body temperature and fever impact CAR and outcome.Methods:We calculated the pressure reactivity index (PRx) using the CENTER-TBI high-resolution intensive care unit cohort, as a moving correlation coefficient between intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Minute and hourly values of PRx and temperature were averaged in patients with simultaneous recording of ICP and ABP. Demographic data was based the Core Registry (V2.0). Linear mixed models were calculated based on minute-by-minute data using R with lme4 V1.1-21 and ggeffects V0.9.0. Generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze changes during effervescence (increase of temperature of >1°C within 3 hours).Results:We assessed high frequency physiological data during 567 days of 102 patients admitted to the ICU with predominantly a closed injury type (N=94/102). Median age was 46 years (IQR 29-62), baseline GCS was 6 (IQR 3-9), and 27% had at least one unreactive pupil. The main measurement site for temperature was the urinary bladder 55/102(54%). Half of the patients (49/102) developed fever(>1h with mean T ≥ 38.3°C) with a total of 834h fever and a median of 9h fever(IQR 4-24) per patient. Of 110 effervescence episodes 30(27%) reached the febrile threshold of 38.3°C which was associated with an increase in PRx from 0.09 (±SD 0.25) at baseline (2h before) to 0.26 (±SD 0.3) during the febrile peak (p=0.014) (Figure 1-A). Linear mixed models showed a quadratic relationship between PRx and temperature (p<0.001) with an increase in predicted PRx with febrile and hypothermic temperatures (Figure 1B).Conclusions:The association of increasing body temperature with worsening of CAR supports prevention of fever in severe TBI.

In this study we investigated the association between changes in brain temperature (BT), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).Methods:CENTER-TBI is a co-operative effort of several neurotrauma centers in Europe and includes a repository of monitored data sampled at high-frequency (from 200 Hz to 500 Hz). Simultaneous BT, ICP and CPP recordings were studied, focusing on episodes of BT changes (delta BT ≥0.5 °C, lasting 15 minutes - 3 hours) up or down-ward. Using the linear correlation coefficient episodes were coded as responding (R), when there was a clear association between ICP and BT (Pearson’s R value ≥0.5) or non-responding (NR) when the correlation coefficient was <0.5.Results:Twenty-one patients were selected for the study for a total of 2435 monitoring hours. The mean duration of monitoring was 86 hours. All patients reached a BT above 38° and experienced at least one episode of ICP above 20 mmHg. A CPP lower than 60 mmHg (often of very short duration) has been recorded in all patients. 149 episodes (79 for BT elevation and 70 for BT reduction) were identified. During BT elevations, the increase in temperature was accompanied by ICP increases in slightly more than half episodes (43 R (54%) vs 37 NR (46%)). During BT reduction there were 32 R (46%) and 38 NR (54%) episodes.Conclusions:Patients after TBI usually develop BT> 38° soon after the injury. The BT may influence brain physiology, as reflected by ICP, through vascular responses (respectively vasodilation/vasoconstriction). Our analysis identified potential ICP and CPP variations connected to BT changes in approximately half of episodes. However, it has to be noted that both ICP and CPP have been actively manipulated in the ICU, potentially blunting the biological responses due to BT.P033 Subclinical AKI in severe traumatic brain injuryS De Rosa1, G Golino2, G Villa3, S Samoni4, M De Cal4, MA Martin5, G Berdin5, P Persona2, P Navalesi2, C Ronco61San Bortolo Hospital, Department of Intensive Care, Vicenza, Italy;2University of Padova, Department of Medicine – DIMED, Section of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Padova, Italy;3University of Florence, Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Florence, Italy;4San Bortolo Hospital, Department of Nephrology, Vicenza, Italy;5San Bortolo Hospital, Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Vicenza, Italy;6San Bortolo Hospital, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova-Italy, Vicenza, ItalyIntroduction:Acute kidney injury (AKI) is relatively common in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and it can contribute to morbidity and mortality [1].

All consecutive patients with a clinical need for ICP monitoring were included for analysis. Urine samples of severe TBI patients was collected at ICU admission from 33 patients to measure NephroCheck (NC) test [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] was performed using the NephroCheck® Astute1 40 ™ meter. Serum creatinine was collected at admission, during the first three days, at ICU dismission and 60-days follow up to assess renal recovery. The diagnosis of AKI was based on KDIGO criteria. Hemodynamics, electrolytes, PEEP, P/F, kind of fluid administered, Fluid Balance, % Fluid overload, length of stay, The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, injury severity scores and mortality were collected.Results:A total of 15 patients (45%) presented a median NC higher values at ICU admission. One patient with positive NC value experienced AKI at 24 hrs. The positive NC group had more plasma transfusion (p-value 0.03) and a lower median hematocrit at 24 hrs (p-value 0.013), but similar hospital length of stay (p=0.17) and mortality rate (p=0.80)Conclusions:NC at ICU admission identifies subclinical AKI in TBI patients and it maight be used to predictclinical AKI.

We looked at the rationale for commencing TTM, temperature control devices, if we met temperature guidelines and the reasons for TTM failure.Methods:We retrospectively analysed patients who had been coded OHCA on iCLIP (our electronic patient record) between 30/06/2018 to 30/06/19. We analysed ICU charts for recorded temperatures (< 72hrs) for TTM patients. We then accessed notes through iCLIP and assessed rationale for TTM commencement and reasons for failure. We compared our results to our ICU standards, based on current consensus and the TTM1 results [1]. We also looked at the effectiveness of a clerking proforma (Feb 2019) on documentation.Results:95 patients were admitted post OHCA. 76 were initiated on TTM; of the 19 not: 10 patients were critically unstable, while 9 patients had good GCS on ROSC. Of recorded arrest rhythms 57/71 (80%) of TTM patients were shockable while 9/15 (60%) of non TTM patients were shockable. Of the TTM patients: 6 had surface cooling devices and 70 had intravascular cooling devices. 21/73 (29%) of TTM patients failed TTM adherence by either having a mean of >0.5°C OR a spike of >1°C above target temperature. 13/ 21 (62%) had predictable medical causes of TTM failure: Aspiration pneumonia or myoclonic jerks. The other 8 patients had process-based failures: going for PCI or being warmed early. The proforma has had a marked improvement on documentation.Conclusions:These results highlight that raised temperatures in TTM are predictable. To improve this we will focus on recognition of these risk factors and establish means to minimise their impact. We have also shown the benefit of an established clerking proforma.References:1.

Biochemical biomarkers released from cerebral cells after hypoxic-ischemic injury represent potential tools to increase accuracy in predicting outcome after OHCA. Currently, only neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is recommended in European prognostication guidelines. In this study, we present the release dynamics of GFAP and UCH-L1 after OHCA and evaluate their prognostic performance for long-term neurological outcome in OHCA patients.Methods:Serum GFAP and UCH-L1 were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h after OHCA. The primary outcome was neurological function at 6-month follow-up assessed by cerebral performance category scale (CPC), dichotomized into good (CPC 1-2) and poor (CPC 3-5). Outcome prognostic performance was investigated with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and compared to NSE.Results:717 of 819 included patients had at least one serum GFAP or UCH-L1 value at 24, 48 or 72 h after OHCA. GFAP and UCH-L1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with poor outcome. GFAP and UCH-L1 discriminated excellently between good and poor neurological outcome at all time-points (AUROC GFAP 0.88-0.89; UCH-L1 0.86-0.87) and overall predictive performance measured by AUROC of GFAP and UCH-L1 was superior to NSE (AUROC 0.76-0.85) (Figure 1). However, the ROC at the highest specificities of UCH-L1 and GFAP overlap those of NSE and comparing the sensitivities for UCH-L1 and GFAP with those of NSE for the highest specificities (>95%) revealed higher sensitivities for NSE than for UCH-L1 and GFAP at 48 and 72 h.Conclusions:GFAP and UCH-L1 predict poor neurological outcome in patients after OHCA excellently and with a higher overall accuracy than NSE, but both biomarkers perform inferior to NSE at specificities over 95% at 48 and 72 h limiting their clinical use to guide decisions on prognosis.Fig. 1 (abstract P039).A-C, Receiver-operating characteristic analyses for prediction of Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) Scale 1-2 vs CPC 3-5 at 6-months follow-up for serum samples collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours.

(2) Patients surviving with severe HIE – unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (CPC 4). (3) Deceased patients with post-mortem brain autopsy. In these autopsy patients, we used the Selective Eosinophilic Neuronal Death (SEND) classification to quantify the histopathological severity of HIE.Results:We included 354 autopsy patients, 118 had histopathological severe and 236 patients no/mild HIE. Between autopsy patients with no/mild HIE and severe HIE, there was no difference in mean MAP during the first week. However, no/mild HIE autopsy patients with post-CA regain of consciousness had a mean MAP of 75 mmHg compared to 65 mmHg in those never conscious before death. We found no difference in MAP between 216 patients with full neurological recovery (CPC 1) and 57 surviving with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (CPC 4). Hypothermia induced small reversible hypotension in all groups.Conclusions:Contradicting previous studies, we found no difference in post-CA MAP of patients with histopathological and clinical evidence of presence and absence of HIE. No/mild HIE patients with post-CA regain of consciousness before death showed high-normal blood pressure stability. This may indicate a blood pressure effect on neuronal function rather than structural integrity.

When adjusting for confounders (educational level, sex, age, comorbidity and hospital type) there were still higher chance of receiving early coronary angiography with increasing income, OR 1.31 (CI 1.01-1.68) and 1.67 (CI 1.29-2.16) for the two highest income quartiles respectively compared to the lowest income quartile. When adding potential mediators to the model (initial rhythm, location, response time, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and if the arrest was witnessed) no difference in early angiography related to income level where found. The main mediator was initial rhythm (Figure 1).Conclusions:Higher income is strongly related to the rate of early coronary angiography after OHCA. This finding is consistent when adjusting for known confounders. However, the association between income and early angiography seems to be mediated by initial rhythm. Patients with low income more often presents with non-shockable rhythms which lowers the likelihood to undergo early coronary angiography.Fig. 1 (abstract P046).Correlation between disposable income and rate of early coronary angiography.

There were no differences in compression rate (p=0.210), chest release (p=0.514) and time of correct frequency (p=0.586). It was also tested how many of the parameters were performed correctly by students at CPR. The chi-square test shows the relative frequency of CPR success is higher for the CC3 group than for the CC1 group. At least 3 out of 4 parameters were correctly performed by 13% of CC1 students compared to 28% of CC3 students.Conclusions:The study showed a significant improvement of CPR in the final CC3 and supported the three semester simulation education.P048WithdrawnP049 Changes in blood gases during intraoperative cardiac arrestJJ Wang, R Borgstedt, S Rehberg, G JansenProtestant Hospital of the Bethel Foundation, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care and Emergency medicine, Transfusion medicine and Pain therapy, Bielefeld, GermanyIntroduction:Blood gas analysis (BGA) is a common approach for monitoring the homeostasis during surgery. While it is well known that cardiac arrest (CA) leads to circulatory collapse and disturbances in homeostasis, little is known about changes of blood gas during peri-operative CA.Methods:We retrospectively analysed patients ≥18 years who suffered from peri-operative CA during non-cardiac surgery from 01/2014 to 12/2018. Peri-operative CA was defined as need for cardiac compression during anaesthesia care. Collected data included pH, PaCO2, PaO2, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day mortality after CA.Results:Within the study period, we observed 56 peri-operative CA (m=35, f=21; age 69±16) during 62742 anaesthesia procedures (ROSC occurred in 38 patients (68%). 30 days after CA, the mortality was 45% (n=17), 23% (n=13) were discharged, and 14% (n=8) still in hospital. 87% (n=49) of CA patients had an invasive blood pressure monitoring, 52% (n=29) had BGA before and 66% (n=37) during peri-operative CA. Prior to CA, the average values were: pH 7.3±0.1, PaCO2 39±8 and PaO2 225±107. During CA, the average values were pH 7.2±0.2, PaCO2 50±17 and PaO2 215±138. Table 1 shows the distributions of blood gas before and during CA. There were no statistical differences between the groups (pH: p=0.4; PaCO2: p=0.19; PaO2: p=0.21).Conclusions:Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis is common in peri-operative CA. These data suggests inadequate ventilation during peri-operative resuscitation. Further studies should focus on its impact on the outcome.Table 1 (abstract P049).Changes in blood gases during intraoperative cardiac"

Beside-diagnostics and trained healthcare professionals are immediately available. This offers exceptional opportunities and poses the question which diagnostic strategies are carried out in ICU-CA.Methods:Retrospective analysis of adult ICU-CA from 2016-2018 at a maximum care hospital in Germany with five ICU (two perioperative, two medical, one interdisciplinary) summarizing 71 ICU beds. ICU-CA was defined as requirement for chest compressions and/or defibrillation according to Utstein criteria. Diagnostics during ICU-CA were collected and analysed. Subgroup analyses included patients with and without ROSC. Primary endpoint was the performance rate of additional diagnostics during ICU-CA. Secondary endpoints were the type of diagnostics (i.e. blood gas analysis [BGA], echocardiography [EC] or chest-x-ray [XR]) and its therapeutic consequences.Results:There were 114 ICU-CA out of 14.264 ICU patients in total (incidence 79.9 per 10.000 ICU patients [CI95 65.3-94.5). All patients were monitored (electrocardiogram, pulsoxymetry, invasive blood pressure). During ICU-CA 50 (44%) patients received at least one additional diagnostic [i.e. BGA 41 (36%), EC 22 (19%) or XR 7 (6%)]. In 27 (54%) of these cases a therapeutic consequence was documented. These were application of HCO3- [n=12 (11%)], thoracic drainage [n=5 (4%)], transfusion or pericardiocentesis [each n=3 (3%)], lysis and bronchoscopy [each n=2 (2%)]. Comparing cases with and without ROSC, there were significant more diagnostics done in the group without ROSC but more therapeutic consequences seen in the ROSC-group (Table 1).Conclusions:ICU-CA is frequent. Diagnostics to detect reversible causes of CA were used rarely in ICU-CA (44%), even in patients without ROSC. Notably, diagnostics often had therapeutic consequences particularly in ROSC. Further studies are required to define standardized diagnostic algorithms during ICU-CA.Table 1 (abstract P050).ICU-CA"

Previous studies have reported that clinical outcomes are improved if IHCA is witnessed, or if a patient admitted to a monitored location [1, 2]. This study aimed to evaluate the association between continuous monitoring and survival of IHCA on general ward.Methods:A retrospective cohort study of IHCA in patients admitted to ward at an academic tertiary care hospital between January 2009 and December 2018 was performed. The primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The secondary outcomes were 72-hour survival and survival to hospital discharge.Results:Of the 996 enrolled patients, 54.7% patients had monitored. Among monitored group, 63.5% patients were pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram monitored. There were many witnessed events in the monitored group (93.8% vs. 57.4%, p<0.0001). By univariate analysis, there was difference of ROSC in the monitored group (73.8% vs. 66.7%, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.40 [1.07-1.84]; p=0.016). There were no significant difference 72-hour survival (1.00 [0.68-1.47]; p=0.993) and survival to hospital discharge (1.03 [0.77-1.36]; p=0.864). In subgroup multivariate analyses, the groups were divided according to illness category. In patients with cardiac illness, ROSC (83.0% vs, 63.5%, 2.86 [1.02-8.09]; p=0.047) and 72-hour survival (67.0% vs. 49.4%, 2.40 [1.04-5.51]; p =0.039) were higher in the monitored group (Table 1).Conclusions:Cardiac patients with continuous monitoring on general ward showed improving ROSC and 72-hour survival but not survival to hospital discharge in IHCA.References:1.

Although steroids are frequently used in patients with septic shock, it is unclear whether they are beneficial during cardiac arrest and after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).Methods:Of 369 cardiac arrest patients evaluated, 100 were enrolled. Advanced life support was conducted according to the2015 resuscitation guidelines. Forty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive methylprednisolone 40 mg during resuscitation, and 54 to receive saline (placebo). After resuscitation, steroid-treated patients received hydrocortisone 240 mg daily for up to 7 days, followed by tapering over the next 2 days. Primary outcomes were mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) at 20 minutes, 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after ROSC. Secondary end-points included left ventricular ejection fraction and eccentricity index at 12 and 72 hours, cardiac output and serum cytokine levels at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours, cerebral blood flow index at 4 and 72 hours after ROSC, organ failure–free days from follow-up day 1 through 60,neurological status at dischargeand steroid-associated complications.Results:Post-resuscitation MAP did not differ significantly between steroid- and placebo-group at any time point (20 min: 85.2±21.3 vs. 84.7±21.4; 4h: 83.9±18.1 vs. 78.9±15.9; 24h: 79.9±16.0 vs. 81.9±15.2; 48h: 80.2±10.0 vs. 84.2±13.6; 72h: 85.2±11.6 vs. 84.7±14.5 (p>0.05 for all comparisons).

Qualitative data collected during the online survey were analysed using content analysis. An Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis approach was used for analysis of qualitative interview dataResults:Responses to the online questionnaire were received from 33% of AIRWAYS-2 study paramedics and 19 study paramedics were interviewed. Paramedics described barriers and facilitators to trial participation and changes in their views and practice. The results are presented in five distinct themes: research process; changes in views and practice regardingairway management; engagement with research; professional identity; professional competence.Conclusions:Participation in the AIRWAYS-2 trial was enjoyable and EMS providers valued the training and study support. There was enhanced confidence in airway management as a result of taking part in the trial. Study paramedics expressed preference for the method of airway management to which they had been randomized.

Medical care associated complications leading to ICUCA were detected in 28 cases (22%) [Incidence 19.6/10,000(CI95 12.3 -26.9)].ICUCA following therapeutic interventions occurred because of circulatory insufficiency [n=20(70%)], respiratory failure [n=5(17%)] and airway associated problems [n=3(10%)]. Nine of the 28 patients (32%) with care-associated ICUCA died. Table 1 demonstrates therapeutic interventions followed by ICUCA.Conclusions:Care-associated complications were common reasons for ICUCA.

However, IHCA has received less attention than out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). There have been some studies on IHCA; however, there is a lack of information on the evidence and clinical features of IHCA compared with information for OHCA. We therefore conducted this study to clarify important aspects of the epidemiology and prognosis of IHCA in patients with code blue activation.Methods:We carried out a retrospective observational study of patients with code blue events in our hospital during the period from January 2010 to October 2019. We obtained information on the characteristics of patients including age and gender, IHCA characteristics including the time of cardiac arrest, event being witnessed, presence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial shockable rhythm, vital signs 1 h or 6 h before cardiac arrest, survival to hospital discharge (SHD), and the cardiac arrest survival postresuscitation in-hospital (CASPRI) score. The primary endpoint was SHD. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.Results:A total of 293 code blue events were activated during the study period. Finally, 81 patients were included in this study. Overall, the SHD rate was 28.4%. The median time of CPR was 14 min (interquartile range, 6-28 min). The rate of initial shockable rhythm was 19.8%. There were significant differences in CPR duration, shockable rhythm, and CASPRI score between the SHD group and non-SHD group by univariate-logistic regression analysis. CASPRI score was found to be the most effective predictive factor for SHD (OR=0.98, p=0.006) by multivariate-logistic regression analysis.Conclusions:Our results demonstrated that CASPRI score is associated with SHD in CPA patients with in-hospital code blue events.

Although premature birth is described as a risk factor for peri-operative complications and cardiac arrest (POCA) there are no data on its incidence and causality in this particular population [1]. The present study investigates the incidence and causality of pediatric POCA at a tertiary care hospital and level I perinatal center in Germany.Methods:In the anesthesia database of the study center, all anaesthesiological procedures in patients <16 years of age were examined for POCA in preterm infants (gestational age <40th week of gestational age) between 2008 and 2018. The peri-operative period was defined between the beginning of anesthesiological care up to 60 minutes after anesthesia and/or sedation. We defined cardiac arrest as the necessity of chest compressions. The perioperative phase and the cause of the POCA, gestational age and birth weight were recorded.Results:Between 2008 and 2018, 308 (1.3%) of the 22,650 pediatric anesthesiological procedures were performed on 301 premature infants. In total, 10 POCA occurred in 9 of these patients (f=6, M=3; average gestional age 208±27 days; average birth weight 1510±747g (incidence 3.2%, CI 96 1.3-5.2%). The time of occurrence and the causes of POCA are shown in Table 1.Conclusions:POCA in premature babies is rare and has an incidence of 1.3%, which is significantly higher than the non-premature babies. The main causes are problems or complications associated with the respiratory tract and its management, as well as massive hemorrhage.References:1. Habre W et al.

The peri-operative period was defined between the beginning of anesthesia care up to 60 minutes after anesthesia or sedation. Cardiac arrest was defined as the necessity of chest compressions. Age, weight, ASA status, cause of death and survival after 30 days were recorded.Results:18 POCA (median weight was 2525g [Q1 7151;Q75(14748)]) were observed in 22,650 anaesthesiological procedures (incidence 7.9±4.2 per 10,000 [CI95 4.3-11.6]). Table 1 shows the distribution of the individual age groups, incidences and mortalities of POCA. Peri-operative 30-day mortality was 3 per 10,000 [CI 95 1-5]. Three children died intraoperatively as a result of hemorrhagic shock, one on the PICU as a result of malignant hyperthermia. 30 days after POCA, 4 more children had died on the ICU due to their underlying disease.Conclusions:POCA is a rare event. Risk factors are an age <28 days and an ASA status ≥ III.

Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved in approximately half of resuscitation attempts, but rate of survival to hospital discharge is substantially lower [1]. In our centre, post-arrest care accounts for 6.4% of ICU admissions. Premorbid social function is purported to affect outcomes, but comorbidity scores are more often used for risk stratification. Using a novel Social Function Score alongside an existing comorbidity scale, we aimed to identify trends to inform management of patients at risk of deterioration.Methods:A six-month prospective observational study was conducted in a major UK hospital from October 2017 to April 2018. For all adult inpatient cardiac arrests, medical notes were reviewed and data collected on the following domains:Patient demographicsComorbidities and functional statusAdmission detailsPost-arrest eventsStatistical analysis was performed using Student’s unpaired t-test.Results:54 cardiac arrests occurred. 85% were in medical patients, with the majority male (63%) and aged over 75 (63%). 89% were emergency"

Pre-admission function and comorbidity were worse in patients who did not survive to discharge (Fig. 1), but these were not statistically significant in view of small survivor group size.Conclusions:In an increasingly frail inpatient population, a substantial proportion of patients in whom circulation is restored after cardiac arrest are subsequently considered unsuitable for ICU admission.

We determineted poor prognostic sign with post-cardiac arrest patients. In this study, we identified the causes of poor outcome in patients with OHCA.Methods:This was a single-centre, retrospective study. We determined incidence and epidemiological factors including: demographics, initial cardiac rhythm. Our study population were non-traumatic OHCA. Our ICU, All OHCA patient were evaluated wtih ECHO, and fluid, inotrope and vazopressor were added according to cardiac performance.Results:During our study, 5970 patients who were admitted to intensive care unit between 2012-2019 were screened. 133 of these patients were out-of-hospital arrest and 41 of them were in-hospital arrest. Development of cerebral oedema during treatment in hospital remains a poor prognostic sign.

However, the BLS action by schoolchildren may be limited by school rules. This study aimed to analyse the time factors for basic life support performance and outcome in classmate-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and to investigate how schoolchildren act when they detect OHCA.Methods:Nation-wide database for 1,068 school children cases with OHCA and local extended database for 5,478 EMS-unwitnessed OHCA, both of which were prospectively collected during the period of 2011–2016, were retrospectively analysed.Results:Proportion of schoolchildren-detected OHCA was low in classmate cases (16.8%, 179/889) in nationwide database and extremely low in all EMS-unwitnessed OHCAs (1.6%, 88/5,478) in local database. Nationwide database analyses revealed that both emergency call and bystander CPR were delayed when a classmate witnessed the OHCA case: median, 1 vs. 0 min and 3 vs. 2 min, respectively. Classmate-witnessed cases were associated with higher incidences of shockable initial rhythm, AED use and traumatic causes. The rate of neurologically favourable outcome was 19.6% and 12.3%, respectively in classmate-witnessed and other cases: adjusted OR; 99% CI, 1.24; 0.63–2.47. Of 88 cases detected by schoolchildren in our prefecture, 8 (34%) cases had presumed cardiac aertiology and 12(13.8%) cases were caused by suicide attempts (hanging and fall). School children placed emergency 119 calls as the first action only in 32 (36.4%) cases. Emergency calls were largely delayed when school children dialled other numbers or left the scene to seek adult help. School children were rarely involved in bystander CPR (21%) and AED placement (1%).Conclusions:School children are rarely involved in entire BLS. Emergency calls and bystander CPR are delayed when schoolchildren act to seek help. Because schoolchildren detect suicide-related OHCAs, psychological care to schoolchildren involved in BLS may be necessary.P063 Prognostic value of neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte predicting cardiopulmonary resuscitation with spontaneous circulation recoveryC Lithe Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou, ChinaIntroduction:To investigate the predictive value of peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on in-hospital mortality in patients with spontaneous circulation recovery"

They were divided into survival group and death group according to the outcome of discharge.The dynamic changes and differences of NLR and PLR in 24 hours and 48-72 hours after admission to ICU between the two groups were analyzed and compared. Multivariate analysis and ROC curve were used to explore the predictive value of NLR and PLR for in-patient mortality.Results:Compared with the survival group, PLR in the dead group was significantly lower within 24 hours of admission to the intensive care department (P < 0.05), while NLR in 48-72 hours was significantly higher (P < 0.05). The NLR of surviving group was significantly lower than that of 24 hours (P < 0.05), while the NLR and PLR of death group were not significantly different (P < 0.05) from that of 24 hours (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and ROC curve showed that NLR of 48-72 h in ICU was an independent risk factor for predicting in-patient mortality, and had high sensitivity and specificity in predicting death outcomes.Conclusions:Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio can help to judge the outcome of patients with cardiac arrest and recovery of autonomic circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.P064 Neurofilament light chain as an outcome predictor after cardiac arrestL Wihersaari1, N Ashton2, M Reinikainen1, P Jakkula3, V Pettilä3, J Hästbacka3, M Tiainen3, K Blennow2, H Zetterberg2, MB Skrifvars31University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Kuopio, Finland;2University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden;3University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, FinlandIntroduction:High concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NFL) in serum predicted poor outcome in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest [1].

Ischemia reperfusion through lesions due to oxidative stress is responsible for cell damages and free iron may play a key role in these phenomenons. Little is known about magnitude of changes in iron metabolism parameters after cardiac arrest and its association to patient’s prognosis.Methods:This is a single centre cohort study. Adults admitted for OHCA and receiving targeted temperature management were eligible. Free iron, transferrin saturation coefficient, ferritin, hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor were measured in plasma at ICU admission (H0), at 24 hours (H24) and 48 hours (H48). SOFA score changes were calculated between H0, H24 and H48. Demographic data and neurological status at 6 months with Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC score) were also assessed.

Recent studies show conflicting results in regard to hyperoxia and its association with survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [1]. The aim of this trial is to study the association between early hyperoxia after OHCA with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day survival.Methods:Observational study using data from three Swedish national registers (i.e. intensive care, cardiac arrest and national patient registries). Resuscitated OHCA patients, who are unconscious (Glascow Coma Scale ≤8) and admitted to an ICU between January 2010-March 2016 were included. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on lowest PaO2within 1 hour from ICU arrival.Hypoxiawas defined as PaO2<60 mmHg,normoxiaas PaO260-100 mmHg,hyperoxiaas PaO2100-400 mmHg andsevere hyperoxiaas PaO2> 400 mmHg. Multivariate logistic regression was performed. The primary endpoint was 30-day survival.Results:In total, 3496 patients were included in the analysis of which 284 patients had hypoxia, 1490 had normoxia, 1448 had hyperoxia and 274 had hyperoxia. The crude 30-day survival rates were 27.1% in the hypoxia group, 38.1% in the normoxia group, 34.9% in the hyperoxia group and 25.9% in the severe hyperoxia group (Figure 1). The hyperoxia group had significantly lower 30-day survival compared to the normoxia group, adjusted odds ratio 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.89, p=0.01). The difference in survival between the other groups compared to the normoxia group did not meet statistical significance.Conclusions:In this Swedish observational cohort study of resuscitated OHCA patients,early severe hyperoxia, compared to normoxia, was associated with significantly lower 30-day survival. This is in accordance with several previous reports and warrant further studies.References:1. Wang CH et al. Resuscitation"

This study examined the association between increased inflammation and early-onset pneumonia (EOP) in patients treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).Methods:This retrospective study included data of patients with OHCA treated with ECPR admitted to St. Luke’s International Hospital between April 2006 and April 2019. The exclusion criteria were as follows: age < 18 years, therapeutic hypothermia withdrawal due to death or circulatory failure, or sepsis as a suspected cause of cardiac arrest. Patients were diagnosed with EOP according to clinical signs and symptoms acquired after a hospitalization period of >48 h and within 7 days of admission. The CRP levels were measured daily from admission to day 3.Results:We studied 55 patients with a median age of 55 years (interquartile range: 42-65 years). Furthermore, 52 (95%) patients were males, and the median time interval from collapse to adequate flow was 51 (42-63) min. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics, and 18 (33%) of them had favorable neurological outcomes (CPC, 1-2). EOP occurred in 32 (58%) patients, with a significantly higher CRP level on day 3 than that in those without EOP (13.9 [11.2-19.0] mg/dL vs. 10.9 [7.3-13.6] mg/dL, p = 0.006). Multivariable analysis revealed that the CRP level on day 3 (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.56; p = 0.002) was significantly associated with EOP development.Conclusions:Increased inflammation correlated with EOP development in patients with OHCA treated with ECPR.References:1.

Reasons for death for patients with va-ECMO for shock (survival 53%) and eCPR (36%) were: neurological withdrawal of care (10% vs 25%), comorbid withdrawal of care (18% vs 4%), refractory hemodynamic shock (16% vs 33%), respiratory failure (3% vs 2%), and withdrawal due to presumed patient will (0% vs 1%) (Figure 1). The differences in reasons for death among the two groups were significant (p <0.001), driven by withdrawal due to neuroprognostication, comorbidity and hemodynamic instability.Conclusions:Categorizing death after va-ECMO into five categories is feasible.

Veno-venous (VV) ECMO is an effective bridging strategy for patients listed for transplant, with end stage respiratory failure, who acutely deteriorate.Methods:A retrospective observational study of patients supported by VV ECMO whilst awaiting lung transplantation, over a 67-month period (March 2014- October 2019) at Harefield Hospital, in the UK.Results:32 patients with an acute deterioration of their end-stage lung disease required VV ECMO support as a bridge to transplantation (BTT). The mean age was 34.8 years (range 19-57), 62% were male patients. Aetiology included; end stage cystic fibrosis (n=24, 75%), pulmonary fibrosis (n=4, 12.5%), previous lung transplant failure (n=2, 6.3%), bronchiectasis (n=1, 3.1%) and pulmonary hypertension (n=1, 3.1%). Average duration of ECMO support pre-lung transplant was 11.1 days (range 1-39 days). Cannulation was femoral-femoral (n= 20), Avalon Elite® (n = 6) and femoral – jugular (n= 6). 19 patients (59.4%) underwent lung transplant on VV ECMO support, the others required conversion to veno-arterial (VA) ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass, most commonly due to hemodynamic compromise. Average duration of invasive ventilation post-transplant was 19.8 days, with 18 patients (56.3%) requiring a tracheostomy. The mean ICU stay was 25.6 days, with an ICU mortality of 21.9% (n =7); in keeping with the literature [2]. However, patients requiring intubation despite VV ECMO (n=7), pre-transplant had a far higher mortality (n=5, 71.4%).Conclusions:VV-ECMO is a recognized support therapy for patients awaiting lung transplant. Our overall survival to discharge of 78.1%, suggests favourable outcomes are achievable.References:1. NHS Blood and transplant, 2017. Annual report on cardiothoracic organ transplantation"

Previous studies have reported that increased D-dimer is a useful predictor of thrombus formation within the ECMO circuit. The purpose of this study was to identify coagulation/fibrinolysis markers for predicting the replacement of ECMO circuit due to intra-circuit thrombus during ECMO support.Methods:Fourteen patients who underwent veno-venous ECMO for acute respiratory failure between January 2014 and December 2018 were enrolled. These patients received a total of 125 days of ECMO support. Of these, 9 days (times) on which the ECMO circuits were replaced was regarded as the replacement group, while the remaining 116 days were considered as the non-replacement group. The several coagulation/fibrinolysis markers were routinely measured every day during ECMO support. we compared with the levels of these markers between two group to identify the most relevant marker for ECMO circuit replacement due to thrombus.Results:The mean duration of ECMO support was 9±11 days, and the mean number of ECMO circuit replacement was 0.6±1.0 times per patient. D-dimer, Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), Plasmin-α2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), and soluble fibrin (SF) were significantly higher in the replacement group rather than in the non-replacement group (P < 0.01, respectively). According to a multivariate analysis, SF was the only independent predictor of ECMO circuit replacement due to thrombus. The odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for SF (10 μg/mL) was 1.2 (1.1-1.3). The area under the curve and optimal cut-off value were 0.94 and 85 ng/mL for SF, respectively (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 85%).Conclusions:From these results, we concluded that SF may be the useful marker rather than D-dimer for predicting the replacement of ECMO circuit due to intra-circuit thrombosis.P072 Inhomogeneity of lung elastance in patients who underwent veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO)- a computed tomography scan studyRD Di Mussi1, RI Iannuzziello2, FM Murgolo2, FD De Carlo2, E Caricola2, NA Barrett3, LC Camporota3, SG Grasso21Università degli studi di Bari \"Aldo Moro\", Department of emergencies and organ transplant, Bari, Italy;2Università degli studi di Bari \"Aldo Moro\", Bari, Italy;3Department of Adult Critical Care, Guy´s and St Thomas´ NHS Foundation Trust, King´s Health Partners, London, UKIntroduction:In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"

The recruitment maneuvers aim to re-open collapsed lung tissue. In a theoretical point view, this strategy may also prevent the normal aerated lung tissue hyperinflation [1]. The objective of our study was to evaluate lung characteristics in terms of Hounsfield Units (HU), volume and elastance before and after a recruitment maneuver.Methods:In 37 patients with severe ARDS who underwent V-V ECMO, computed tomography scans (CT-scans) at 5 cmH2O of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 45 cmH2O were performed. The same CT image was selected at the two different levels of pressure. The distribution of lung opacities, in terms of HU, was classified using the “UCLA” colour coding table (OsiriX image processing software, Geneva, Switzerland). Correspondent lung regions of about 1020 voxels were selected. The quantitative analysis, in terms of Volume air (Vair) was performed with Maluna software (Version 3.17; Maluna, Goettingen, Germany). Elastance was calculated as the pressure(cmH2O)/ Vair (ml) ratio.Results:See Figure 1.Conclusions:Lung inhomogeneity occurs also after recruiting maneuvers. Our data confirm that the elastance of recruited lung regions is higher than the elastance of the normal aerated lung regions at low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (baby lung). On the contrary the “baby lung” frequently develops hyperinflation. The unpredictable pattern of distribution of volume after recruitment maneuverers may explain the controversial role of PEEP during the ARDS treatment.References:1. Camporota L et al.

However, cause-specific mortality is rarely reported, probably due to the difficulty of its classification. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the agreement between two expert ICU physician in the classification of the cause of death of patients supported with ECMO for either respiratory or cardiac support.Methods:Two Intensive Care Unit (ICU) expert staff physicians independently reviewed the entire medical records of all ECMO patients who died before ICU discharge from January 2011 to September 2019 at Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda, Milan.

Several positive effects might be linked to this so called “awake ECMO”. So far there is little evidence about indications and outcome of this approach.Methods:We report retrospective registry data on all ARDS patients treated with ECMO support at a university hospital between 10/2010 and 04/2019. In a systematic review of medical records, we distinguished between patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) from the initiation of ECMO therapy (IMV group) and patients that received any kind of non-invasive oxygen supply (non-IMV group).Results:A total of 276 patients could be analysed. 16 (5.8%) patients received non-IMV ECMO support. Patients receiving non-IMV ECMO therapy showed severe underlying pulmonary disease and immunosuppression (Fig. 1). These patients had higher rates of lung fibrosis, long-term oxygen therapy, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency and immunosuppression (p<0.05). 12 of 16 patients (75%) required IMV during the hospital stay in average 5.3±5.0 [0.8-17.1] days after ECMO initiation. Reasons were hypoxia despite of ECMO, insufficient ECMO-flow, insufficient protective reflexes or patient agitation. Patients with initially non-IMV ECMO support showed a numerical but not significant lower ICU and hospital survival (25.0% vs. 45.4%, p=0.111).Conclusions:Non-IMV ECMO support was applied in patients with severe underlying pulmonary disease and/or immunosuppression. In a high proportion of patients the ventilation regime had to be switched from non-invasive to invasive. Survival in this very selected cohort was low. In this retrospective analysis no evident benefit for a non-invasive ventilation strategy could be found.

It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected database, performed as part of ongoing quality improvement initiatives.Methods:The setting of this study is an 18-bed, combined surgical and medical adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) located in a 570-bed hospital that serves as the national referral centre for Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart & Lung transplantation and ECMO in Ireland. We reviewed 33 months of data (from 2017 to 2019) regarding patients admitted to our critical care unit who required intra-hospital transfer for diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. We also compared the data to available local guidelines.Results:23 patients were transported on ECMO on a total of 28 occasions; the most common indication being CT brain (Table 1). ECMO cannulation sites were peripheral in 20 patients, 3 patients were centrally cannulated. Median time from start of the transfer until the patient was returned to ICU was 50 minutes (range: 35-195). The ECMO console was placed on a dedicated ECMO trolley apart from two occasions where it was placed on the patient's bed. Number of staff required for transport was between 4 to 10; with an ICU Consultant as team leader. ECMO specialist nurses were always present on the transport team. 27 transfers were during normal working hours with 1 happening on a weekend. A total of 12 complications occurred during the transports, of which 1 was significant and 11 were not. The significant complication encountered was Ventricular Tachycardia in a V-A ECMO patient which required electrical defibrillation. No adverse events related to transport were seen following return to ICU.Conclusions:In this single-centre study, we have demonstrated safe intra-hospital transport of ECMO patients.

    "full_text": "membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used increasingly in critically ill patients suffering from acute respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. However, this therapy can have deleterious side effects such as bleeding or clotting complications and hemolysis. These complications are particularly caused by physical stress acting upon the blood components while passing through the ECMO system, especially within the rotary pump. We here present a novel approach to simulate blood flows through rotary blood pumps used in current ECMO systems in order to better understand the genesis of these complications.Methods:Geometries of the Xenios DP3 (Xenios AG, Heilbronn, Germany) rotary pump were reconstructed by CT-scans and manual measurements using computer-aided design (CAD). The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was performed using the software PreonLab (FIFTY2 Technology GmbH, Freiburg, Germany), which implements a mesh-free Lagrangian method requiring minimal preprocessing of the CAD data. The geometries are introduced to the simulation model as tessellated surfaces. Five operating points have been specified by the rotation of the centrifugal fan and the corresponding inflow and outflow of blood. The blood is approximatively modelled as a Newtonian fluid with a density of 1040 kg/m3.Results:PreonLab allows detailed assessment of the blood flow while passing through the rotary pump including analysis of local flow rates, pressure gradients and shear stress acting upon the blood. Dead zones in the fluid flow can be detected which gives reference points for optimizations of the pump design.Conclusions:For the first time, we demonstrate a novel approach for flow simulation in an ECMO rotary pump (Figure 1). This approach may help better understand hemodynamics within the extracorporeal system to define optimal operating points or re-design components aiming to limit hemolysis, coagulation disorders and bleeding in seriously ill patients.Fig. 1 (abstract P078).Visualization of fluid velocity (in m/s) within the rotary pump (cross-section)P079 One-year experience of bedside percutaneous VA-ECMO decannulation in a territory ECMO center in Hong KongKM Fong, SY Au, PW Leung, KC Shek, HJ Yuen, SK Yung, HL Wu, SO So, WY Ng, KH LeungQueen Elizabeth Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Hong KongIntroduction:When veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support can be terminated, arteriotomy wounds of the patients of are traditionally closed by open repair in the operation theaters.

Patients were divided into two groups: those who developed a neurological complication and those who did not (the control group). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with neurologic complications.Results:Neurologic complications occurred in 87 patients (21.0%), including cerebral infarction in 33 patients (8.0%), brain death in 30 patients (7.2%), seizures in 14 patients (3.4%), and intracranial hemorrhage in 11 (2.7%) patients.

Levosimendan (LS) is frequently administered in patients under mechanical circulatory support. We performed a retrospective evaluation of patients treated with LS prior to weaning from mechanical support. This evaluation was combined with a review of the literature.Methods:A query of our ICU patient data management system revealed 22 patients receiving LS prior to or during VAD/ECLS support. Outcome data were obtained from the patients medical records.Results:Of our 22 patients, 78% was successfully weaned off ECLS. Fourteen patients (63 %) died before being discharged of whom 5 while on ECLS support. Of the weaned patients, 9 died afterwards. 4 of the converted patients needed subsequent veno-venous ECLS support for right ventricular support after the implantation. Survival to discharge ratio for the whole group was 31 %. More detailed demographic results can be found in Table 1.Literature reviewA pubmed search using the terms “(ECMO OR ECLS) AND LS AND weaning” resulted in 7 publications which dealt specifically with weaning of ECLS support. Several weaning approaches are available, however poor outcome has remains a problem. Some recent studies show a possible beneficial effect of LS infusion prior to weaning from ECLS. However most of these studies are retrospective or observational at best. Because LS is primarily reserved for the most severe cases, outcome interpretation is difficult. Overall weaning success ranges from 82%-92% and variation is very dependant of inclusion criteria.Conclusions:The calcium sensitizer LS can be used when weaning off patients from ECLS, certainly given its low incidence of complications.

CT occurred after 19,6±24,6 days of ECMO support. CT was suspected during VA-ECMO due to sudden hemodynamic deterioration with decreased pulse pressure. In VV-ECMO, CT was suspected due to circulatory collapse, with cardiopulmonary arrest in 2 patients. A large pericardial effusion with collapsed right chambers by transthoracic echocardiography established the diagnosis, in all cases. Patients with VV-ECMO and cardiopulmonary arrest required ECMO-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR). Emergent surgical drainage of hemopericardium was required in all cases, with cardiac perforation repair in 2 cases. All patients survived to ICU (42,6±25,6 days) and hospital (55,6±28,9 days) discharge without significant complications.Conclusions:CT is a rare but life-threatening complication during both VV- and VA-ECMO. A high index of suspicion is needed and bedside transthoracic echocardiography plays a major role for timely diagnosis and treatment. Excellent prognosis is possible with E-CPR and emergent surgical drainage and repair.P085 Extracorporeal CO2 removal reduces inspiratory muscle effort during renal replacement therapy in a difficult to wean patient after orthotopic liver transplantation: a case reportI CavalliAlma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Policlinico di Sant´Orsola, Bologna, Italy, Bologna, ItalyIntroduction:During a spontaneous breathing trial respiratory mechanics can worsen, and respiratory muscle effort can increase, leading to respiratory muscle fatigue, pump failure, hypercapnia and an unsuccessful weaning from mechanical ventilation. This case report discusses the possibility of applying extracorporeal CO2removal (ECCO2R) to reduce respiratory muscle effort in a liver transplant recipient who already failed three weaning attempts from mechanical ventilation.Methods:The ECCO2R membrane lung was integrated into a conventional renal replacement therapy circuit and blood flow was increased from 150 to 300 ml/min. Measurements of respiratory mechanics (including esophageal pressure, as shown in Fig. 1) were used to assess the reduction of respiratory effort before and during the application of ECCO2R.Results:After 5 minutes of spontaneous breathing (SB), respiratory rate increased from 12 to 24 breaths/min, PaCO2increased from 39 to 54 mmHg, pressure time product per minute (PTP/b) and pressure time product per liter (PTP/L) increased to 142.9±26.9 cmH2O.s/min (from 78.9±15.3 cmH2O.s/min in PSV), and 13.4±2.5 cmH2O.s/L (from 7.1±1.1 cmH2O.s/L in PSV), respectively.

The patient was successfully extubated and ECCO2R was discontinued after 36 hours.Conclusions:In a difficult-to-wean patient recovering from orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), ECCO2R can be added to a renal replacement circuit and may reduce the ventilatory demand and prevent severe hypercapnia and respiratory distress (Figure 1), thus facilitating the recovery of adequate spontaneous ventilation and allowing effective weaning from mechanical ventilation.Consent to publish: written informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.Fig. 1 (abstract P085).From the left to the right: esophageal pressure (i) during pressure support ventilation (PSV); (ii) during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT); (iii) during SBT + ECCO2RP086 AKI during aeCOPD: the potential role of combined renal-respiratory extracorporeal supportL Zamidei1, R Marco2, D Atzeni3, G Boscolo4, F Turani5, G Consales11Prato Hospital, emergency and Intensive Care, Prato, Italy;2IRCCS Policlinico San Donato, Anesthesia and Intensive Care Department, San Donato, Italy;3Marino Hospital, Intensive Care Department, Cagliari, Italy;4Ospedale dell´Angelo, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Department, Mestre, Italy,5Aurelia and European Hospital, Anesthesia and Intensive Care Department, Rome, ItalyIntroduction:We describe the use of a low-flow platform (PrismaLung®-Prismaflex®) for combined extracorporeal CO2 removal-renal support (ECCO2R-CRRT) in patients affected by acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aeCOPD) associated to acute renal failure (AKI).Methods:We evaluated aeCOPD patients submitted to PrismaLung-Prismaflex due to AKI (AKIN >2) associated to hypercapnic acidosis (pH<7.25, pCO2>60 mmHg) during the period May 2016-July 2019 at Prato Hospital ICU. Physiologic data were collected (T0, 24h, 48h, 72h). Complications and outcome were recorded. Data were presented as mean±DS; Anova Test was used to compare changes over time (significance P<0.05).Results:14 aeCOPD patients with AKI and hypercapnic acidosis were identified (75±9yr SOFA 13±2). Rationale for ECCO2R-CRRT was to treat AKI and to facilitate extubation in invasively ventilated patients (IMV 9patients) or to avoid intubation (4patients at risk of non-invasive ventilation-NIV- failure). Hemo-diafiltration (effluent-flow 35 ml/kg/h) was delivered through a 13fr-double-lumen-cannula; 350 ml/min blood-flow with 10lt oxygen sweep-gas-flow and aPTT 1.5-2 baseline were maintained (iv-heparin). In all cases respiratory and metabolic parameters improved without complications (Figure 1). ECCO2R-CRRT facilitated extubation (4 out 9 IMV pts).

Unfortunately, it was not feasible to directly measure ECCO2R rates during the trial.Methods:We used a mathematical model of whole-body oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and biochemistry [2] to calculate ECCO2R rates that permit a fit to the data reported for Hemolung (ALung Technologies) and iLA (Novalung)/Cardiohelp (Getinge) devices in the SUPERNOVA trial [3]. The mathematical model was calibrated under baseline conditions where patients were mechanically ventilated at a TV of 6 mL/kg PBW in the absence of an ECCO2R device; the O2consumption rate, CO2production rate and pulmonary shunt fraction were adjusted to match the measured baseline arterial partial pressure of O2and PaCO2. Assuming all baseline parameters were fixed, TV was then reduced to 4.1 mL/kg PBW and the mathematical model predicted the ECCO2R rate to the change in the PaCO2level.Results:Model predictions for the devices are shown in Table 1.Conclusions:These predictions suggest that ECCO2R rates for iLA/Cardiohelp devices were approximately twice those for Hemolung devices during the SUPERNOVA trial.

This risk is partly due to the adverse effect of AKI on other organs than the kidney. Respiratory complications are frequently associated with the development of AKI. New machines combining CRRT with a carbon dioxide removal membrane (ECCO2R) allows the setting up of an ultra-protective ventilation (4 ml/kg of predicted boby weight (PBW)) to reduce any lung damage from mechanical ventilation (MV). The reduction in tidal volume (Vt) is associated with a decrease in lung damage partly triggered by AKI. We evaluated the efficacy of a combined system CRRT+ECCO2R to reduce the Vt to ultraprotective values in patients with acute respiratory failure and AKI.Methods:Five patients with acute respiratory failure invasively mechanically ventilated for at least 48 that develop AKI needing CRRT were recruited in our ICU. CRRT + ECCO2R was performed with OMNI system® (B.Braun Avitum, Melsungen, Germany). The Vt was progressively reduced to 4 ml/kg/PBW according to a predefined ventilation protocol and therapy was set as follows: CVVHDF, blood flow up to 400 ml/min, dialysis dose 25-35 ml/kg/h, sweep gas:10 L/min. Hemodynamic, respiratory and biochemical clinical parameters were recorded: before the start of treatment (T0) and at the end of each 12-hour interval. Adverse events during treatment have been reported.Results:Within an hour, patients treated with CRRT+ECCO2R have achieved and maintained an ultra-protective ventilation protocol. The pH and PaCO2 values did not show statistically significant differences from T0 throughout the treatment. In treated patients no complications were recorded.Conclusions:The combined system CRRT+ECCO2R was safe and effective in allowing a reduction of the Vt up to 4 ml/kg of PBW.

We assess different degrees of ECCO2R and varying dead space (DS) on ventilator settings in order to minimize mechanical power.Methods:We calculated mechanical power as(1) Power=RR*{∆〖Vt〗^2*[1/2*EL+RR*(1+I:E)/(60*I:E)*R]+ ∆Vt*PEEP}(EL: system elastance, R: airway resistance, PEEP: positive end expiratory pressure, I:E: Inspiratory to expiratory ratio).We calculated the combination of respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (VT) (“optimal RR” and *optimal VT*) leading to minimal applied power for a stable carbon dioxide elimination of 300 ml/min (VCO2) for two scenarios: 1) variation of physiological DS from 10 to 40 % of VT at a fixed rate of ECCOR2. 2) variation of ECCO2R of either 80, 120, 160 or 200 ml/min at a fixed physiological DS of 20%. The alveolar ventilation (VA) necessary to eliminate the VCO2 was calculated as (2) VA= (-VCO2*σ_CO2*R*T*(1+K_c ))/(VCO2/Q-P_vCO2*σ_CO2*R*T*((1+K_c ))/760)σCO2: CO2 solubility in blood, R: gas constant, T: temperature. PvCO2: venous partial pressure, Kc: function of pH (12.5 for a pH of 7.2), Q: blood flow [5 l/min]).Results:Increasing DS from 10 to 40% increases the minimal mechanical power from 5.9 to 10.8 J/min, primarily caused by an increase of optimal Vt (495 – 672 ml). Optimal RR was only slightly increased (6.4 – 7.5 /min, Figure 1 Panel A). For varying ECCO2R removal, necessary ventilation ranges from 1.6 to 3.6 L/min. This predicts a minimal power between 5.6 and 10.4 J/min with an unchanged optimal Vt (540 - 543 ml) and an increasing optimal RR (5.4 to 12.3 /min (Figure 1 Panel B)).Conclusions:In order to minimize mechanical power, increasing shunt or CO2 production should be met with increases in RR while increases in DS should be met with increases in VT. Our results indicate that during ECCO2R, mechanical power and thus risk for lung injury can be minimized with higher VT compared to conservative ventilation strategies.Fig. 1 (abstract P090).Mechanical power as a function of RR and VT for varying ECCO2R and deadspaceP091 Validity of empirical estimates of physiological dead space in acute respiratory distress syndromeJD Dianti, EG Goligher, AS SlutskyUniversity of Toronto, Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, Toronto, CanadaIntroduction:Increased physiological dead space fraction (VD/VT) is a hallmark of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been shown to predict ARDS mortality.

VD/VTcan be measured with volumetric capnography but empirical formulae using the patient’s age, weight, height, gender and PaCO2have been proposed to estimate VD/VTbased on estimates of CO2production (VCO2).

However neuromuscular blockers (NMB) result controvertial in early treatment of ARDS [1]. We ought to search systematically and realize a meta-analysis on the matter.Methods:An electronic search of randomized clinical trials in adult patient treated with early neuromuscular blockers compared without neuromuscular blockers in ARDS. The primary objective of the analysis was the mortality at 21 to 28 days. Secondary endpoints included mechanical ventilation free days, ICU acquired weakness and barotrauma.Results:The search obtained 6 studies for the analysis [1-6]. A total of 1557 patients, 785 patients in the NMB group and 772 patients in the control group were included. Comparing those treated with NMB vs. control, the analysis showed relative risk (RR) 0.87 for mortality at 21 to 28 days (95% CI [0.75-0.99], p=0.04), RR. 0.55 for Barotrauma (95% CI[0.35-0.85], p=0.008), RR.1.19 for ICU acquired weakness (95% CI[0.99-1.42],p=0.07) and mean difference 0.56 for Mechanical ventilation free days (95% CI[-0.46-1.59],p=0.28) (Figure 1).Conclusions:The early use of neuromuscular blockers in ARDS showed no increase in mortality, but the results should be taken with caution.

Lung CT is the golden standard in the detection and characterization of pulmonary infiltrates, but it requires the transportation to the radiology units and radiation exposure. Ultrasound can be performed at the bedside without the need for transportation and without irradiation [1, 2]. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of ultraound in the detection of lung infiltrates, compared to CT scan.Methods:Patients admitted to the ICU for ARF and suspected pulmonary infection, who required CT for detection and characterization of lung infiltrates, were examind by ultrasound.

Diagnostic variables were assessed for lung ultrasound, using CT as a reference point.Results:PUlmonary infiltrates conssitent with pneumonia were confirmed by CT in 24/25 patinets.

The Bland-Altman analysis for the agreement between ΔPes and ΔCVP showed a bias of -0.3 cmH2O and a precision of 2.9 cmH2O in all pigs with all conditions; a bias of 0.1, -0.7, -0.2 cmH2O and a precision of 2.2, 3.6, 2.8 cmH2O in low, normal and high intravascular volume, respectively; a bias of -0.3, -0.2 cmH2O and a precision of 2.8, 3.1 cmH2O in low and high intraabdominal pressure, respectively.Conclusions:Our method can estimate pleural pressure from CVP with a reasonable accuracy regardless of intravascular volume and intraabdominal pressure (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 (abstract P097).The Bland–Altman analysis for the agreement between ΔPes and cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl in various conditions. low: low intravascular volume, normal: normal intravascular volume, high: high intravascular volume, abd-: without an abdominal compression band, abd+: with an abdominal compression bandP098 The role of ultrasound in monitoring diaphragm activity in critically ill patientsF Righetti1, E Colombaroli21Intensive Care Unit, Fracastoro Hospital, Emergency Department, San Bonifacio, Verona, Italy;2Intensive Care Unit, Fracastoro Hospital, San Bonifacio, Verona, ItalyIntroduction:The activity and functionality of the diaphragm are difficult to measure in patients ventilated in intensive care. Ultrasound can be a useful tool for monitoring diaphragm muscle activity during different ventilation modes. Few data currently exist on diaphragm muscle activity in critically ventilated patients [1]. Our goal is to evaluate the respiratory muscular work of the diaphragm with different settings of the respirator by means of an ultrasound scan.Methods:The ultrasound assessments of the diaphragm were performed with a 10MHz linear probe at the apposition zone. We measured the thickening of the diaphragm with the respiratory acts, through the thickening fraction (Thickening Fraction, TF), defined as:TF = (Tdimax - Tdimin / Tdi min)% Tdimax: Diaphragm thickness at the end of inspiration (maximum thickness) Tdimin: Diaphragm thickness at the end of expiration (minimum thickness).

It is associated with morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to assess reintubation rates in a busy district general hospital and evaluate the impact of high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) on reintubation rates.Methods:We performed a retrospective observational study looking at patients admitted to our 7 bedded Level 3 critical care unit (370 patients a year) for a period of 5 years between 1stNovember 2014 and 31stOctober 2019. We included patients over 16 years of age who were mechanically ventilated and length of stay was greater than 48 hours. Exclusions were age < 16 years, tracheostomy and patients requiring ventilation for < 48 hours. Data was collected from Ward Watcher, a SICSAG database and electronic patient records.Results:There was 1735 patients and 1413 patients were included (802 male 611 female). 1076 (76.2%) of patients required ventilation for over 48 hours, 66.7% (718/1065) of those were extubated (Table 1). 25.6% (184/718) of patients required reintubation, despite 54.3% (100/184) receiving HFNO. Of the patients successfully extubated 41.4% (221/534) received HFNO.Conclusions:Our study failed to show any impact of HFNO on reducing extubation failure. Further work is needed to develop a standardized approach to weaning and to consider routine application of non-invasive ventilation to reduce reintubation rates [1].References:1. Hernández G, et al.

Oral care for an intubated patient is important to maintain the moisture of oral mucosa. Also, the securement method of oral endotracheal tube developed from cloth tape to commercial tube holder.Methods:Training PowerPoint and video for microteaching was prepared to train up 30 ICU nurses to perform the new practice. Demonstration and re-demonstration was arranged to assess skills of every nurse. Afterwards, each nurse answered a quiz to evaluate the understanding of OETTH and its special techniques in application. Questionnaire was designed to collect the feedback from all nurses too.Results:The result showed there was 21 nurses (72%) out of 30 nurses achieved full marks in the post-quiz which demonstrated their full understanding of the use of oral ETT holder and its nursing care. About the feedback from nurse, 72% of nurses claimed that they were confident in using the new OETTH in clinical setting after training. 96% of nurses agreed in time-saving of nursing care routine with the use of an OETTH. However, only 56% of nurses agreed that the OETTH is effective in prevention of oral mucosa injuries and another 24% of nursing staff disagreed on its function in improving the patient’s oral care.Conclusions:In conclusion, some of the nurses did not agree the prevention of oral mucosa injuries by the new securement method with OETTH while some nurses welcomed the new OETTH as more easy and effective in oral care to intubated patients.P101 Execution of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy using the standard laryngeal mask airway for ventilation: a prospective survey studyG Gagliardi1, V Gagliardi2, C Chiani3, G Laccania4, F Michielan31AULSS 5 - Veneto, Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Adria, Italy;2AULSS 5 - Veneto, University of Padua, Adria, Italy;3AULSS 5 - Veneto, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Adria, Italy;4AULSS 6 - Veneto, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Padua, ItalyIntroduction:We fulfilled a survey study dealing with bronchoscope-guided percutaneous dilatational tracheostomies (PDT), using the classic laryngeal mask airway (LMA) for the airway management [1].

Finally, in all cases ETCO2, SpO2., PaO2,and blood pH values persisted within the normal range.Conclusions:The standard LMA provides for a reliable airway management and allows an effective ventilation while performing the PDT. Once positioned in the supraglottic zone, the LMA does not need to be moved throughout all the PDT performance, avoiding risks of displacement, glottic harm and airway device damage, and permitting an easy handling of the bronchoscope, which gives an appropriated visualization of the trachea and a more efficient aspiration. In consequence to the large internal diameter of the LMA tube, Ppeak has continued to be stable in all patients, providing for minor resistance and inspiratory work. Eventually, no late complications, such as tracheal stenosis and infections, have occurred.References:1. Strametz R et al.

Int J Crit Illn Inj Sci 5:179–188, 2015P103 Is there benefit to delaying tracheostomy?FS Zimmerman, PD LevinShaare Zedek Medical Center, Intensive Care Unit, Jerusalem, IsraelIntroduction:Tracheostomies are the most common surgical procedure performed on critically ill patients. Randomized control trials comparing tracheostomy timing in intensive care patients have been equivocal. In order to perform non-urgent tracheostomy in our ICU, consent is required from the patient or a formal guardian appointed ad hoc by the courts. Since tracheostomies are practically the only elective surgery performed in the critically ill, ICU requested guardianship almost always indicates a clinical decision to perform tracheostomy. As appointing a guardian and arranging a tracheostomy takes about a week, the decision to appoint a guardian offers a unique \"intention to treat\" opportunity to evaluate outcomes in patients for whom tracheostomy is planned.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis over 3 years on patients for whom guardianship was sought excluding those requiring urgent tracheostomy and those with a do-not-resuscitate order. Patients were divided according to outcome (tracheostomy, extubation or death prior to tracheostomy) and compared.Results:Guardianship was sought for 233 ventilated patients. A decision to withhold tracheostomy was made for 13 patients, who were excluded, leaving 220 patients for analysis. Tracheostomy was performed for 131/220 (60%) patients, 62/220 (28%) were extubated and 27/220 (12%) died while waiting for tracheostomy (from non-airway related reasons). Tracheostomy was performed on mean ventilation day 16±1. Comparing extubated patients to those who had tracheostomy (Table) shows similar demographics, but significantly lower mortality and hospital length of stay.Conclusions:A significant proportion of patients initially planned for tracheostomy were successfully extubated. Despite demographic similarities, mortality in this group was significantly lower than for patients undergoing tracheostomy. For a selected subgroup of possibly difficult to characterize patients, delaying tracheostomy may be beneficial.Table 1 (abstract P103).Tracheostomy demographics and outcomesVariableextubated n=62 (%)tracheostomy n=131 (%)p-valueDemographicsMale45 (72.6)78 (59.5)0.108Age - years ± CI63±863±60.915Surgical patient28 (45.2)50 (38.2)0.432APACHE II score ± CI22±121±10.425OutcomesIn-hospital mortality9 (14.5)37 (28.2)0.046ICU LOS, h, median (IQR)422 (288-518)383 (204-601)0.152hospital LOS, h, median (IQR)857 (628-1180)1236 (857-1633)0.001P104WithdrawnP105 Retrospective audit of tracheostomy insertion in a"

Standards for insertion are available from Intensive Care Societies and eminence-based groups [1]. Standard of PTI has not previously been analyzed in Singaporean public ICUs.Methods:Retrospective analysis was performed of PTIs from September 2015 to 2018. Audit proforma was based on best practice guidelines. PTIs for acute airway scenarios were excluded. Ethical approval was granted via local processes for audit and quality improvement work.Results:151 tracheostomized patients were admitted in the study period. After exclusion, 109 patients were audited. 91 patients had a PTI as a bedside procedure by the ICU team, 17 patients had a tracheostomy performed in theatre; data was missing for 1 case. PTI was performed at a mean of 11 days from admission. Trial of extubation occurred in 44% of cases. Ventilator settings were mostly appropriate (Figure 1). PTIs were analysed by speciality and by outcome. Complications occurred in 6 cases (incidence 6.5%). There were 3 cases of subcutaenous emphysema, 1 pneumothorax (occuring D6 post procedure) and 1 case each of stoma and suture site infection. There was 1 unplanned cannula change within 7 days of insertion. 24% of cases had cuff inflated on discharge from ICU. Handover of care was suboptimal; follow up care plans were documented in 18% of cases. A supervising consultant was present for all PTIs. There was a trend of increased insertion by consultant and increased reliance on theatre, with corresponding decrease in the number inserted by trainees.Conclusions:PTI in our training ICU appears safe with low incidence of complications and good senior support for tracheostomy insertion. Emphasis must continue on training junior intensivists in PTI.

Yet, there is inconsistent evidence of how this is influenced by its bronchoscopically graded severity. This study evaluated the effect of different bronchoscopic BI grades on mortality.Methods:A retrospective, single-centre cohort study of all patients admitted to the London Burns centre intensive care unit (BICU) over 12 years. Demographic data, burn and BI characteristics, and ICU-related parameters were collected. A bronchoscopy expert retrospectively graded BI using bronchoscopy images and reports. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital and ICU length of stay measures. The impact of pneumonia after 48 hours was determined. Univariate and multivariable Cox’s proportional hazards regression analyses informed factors predicting mortality.Results:BI was diagnosed in 84 of 231 (36.4%) critically ill burns patients. Median (IQR) total body surface area burned (TBSA) was 20% (10 to 40). Overall, mortality risk was significantly increased by BI (45.2% vs 23.8%, p<0.001) and pneumonia (27.2% vs 11.3%, p<0.001). Median survival time with BI was significantly lower than without BI (94 vs 131 days, Log-rank test p=0.002). More severe grades of BI (2/3) had significantly increased risk of mortality (adjusted HR=2.14, 95%CI: 1.12-4.09, p=0.022) compared with lower grades (1) (adjusted HR=0.58, 95%CI: 0.18-1.86, p=0.363) (Fig. 1).

Systematic education was provided through group and one to one tutorials to empower nursing and medical staff to titrate oxygen safely and appropriately. Repeat data collection was then performed over 4 weeks.Results:Initially 18/30 patients (60%) were over-oxygenated, as defined by FiO2 >0.5 and SpO2consistently >95%. 12/18 patients with an FiO2of >0.5 had PEEP ≤ 5cm (67%). No patient had a PaO2recorded in the past 24 hours. Education was provided as well as implementation of unit protocols above all patient beds documenting a stepwise approach to titration PEEP and FiO2.

In pediatric burn patients, there is little data on both the rate of TI and the rate of early extubation [3]. It has been common practice for a child with a facial burn and/or a suspected airway injury to be intubated early due to the risk of losing airway patency. However this risk should be mitigated against the potential risks of TI and mechanical ventilation in children. Therefore the aim of this study was to describe the airway status of child burn victims taken in charge of in our pediatric burn intensive care unit. Focused on patients arriving with TI, we investigated the rate of early extubation. In addition we compared non intubated patients with those with prolonged TI.Methods:This retrospective study described a cohort of 1520 patients hospitalized between 2010 and 2018. Data was retrospectively recorded from the patient’s paper clinical chart.Results:The mean age of our patients was 2.8 ±3.1 years [mean±sd] with an average burn area of 14±11%. 86% had scald burns and 45% had facial burns. 4% of the children were admitted in the burn ICU with TI.

Such strategies include non-intubated video assisted thoracic surgery (NiVATS) with spontaneous breathing [3]. Currently neither data on respirator settings nor on gas exchange have been reported for applying the latter. This data constitutes a prerequisite for meaningful evaluating the respiratory consequences of non-intubated spontaneous breathing during lung cancer surgery. The aim of this case series was for the first time providing such data from lung cancer surgery including pneumonectomy.Methods:During a 12 month period 32 patients without contraindications [3] scheduled for video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for non-anatomical and anatomical lung resection including one pneumonectomy (Px) were offered non-intubated spontaneous breathing. All patients gave informed written consent to the procedure as well as for analysis and publication of data. Anaesthetic management included target controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil, laryngeal mask airway, and pressure support ventilation. Data from 2 patients were excluded due to change of procedure for reasons of surgical access. Data are given as median and range (Figure 1).Results:All patients breathed spontaneously during the operation. It allowed for low driving pressures, lung protective tidal volumes, as well as adequate oxygenation also in pneumonectomy. It may result in hypercapnia.

It also increases the risk of ventilation acquired pneumonia and ventilator induced lung injury. The aims of this study were to determine whether cuff deflation trials had an effect on the length of the weaning period, length of ITU stay and total tracheostomy days.Methods:A retrospective audit of all tracheostomized patients admitted to ITU at Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust from 8 January 2017 – 30 August 2019 were reviewed. The exclusion criteria included long term tracheostomies, patients who had a tracheostomy at the point of admission, patients who died or were transferred prior to decannulation and patients with insufficient clinical documentation. Trials of early cuff deflation were introduced to ITU on 26 April 2018. Patients were divided into two groups: the ‘pre-trial group’, consisting of patients who received a tracheostomy prior to 26 April 2018, and the ‘post-trial group’ who received a tracheostomy after 26 April 2018.Results:183 tracheostomized patients were identified with 70 patients meeting the inclusion criteria.

The mean length of ITU stay (43.33 pre-trial vs 39.21 post-trial, p=0.242), the number of total tracheostomy days (31.99 vs 27, p=0.313) and the mean number of days between first cuff deflation and decannulation (21.77 vs 19.11, p=0.385) was not significantly different between groups. The protocol allowed significantly earlier cuff deflation (12.1 vs 4.8 days).Conclusions:We present early data that early trials of cuff deflation within 48 hours of tracheostomy insertion can be achieved using a standardized protocol. Its impact on length of stay, duration of ventilation and patient-centered outcomes needs to be investigated in larger multi-centre trials.P112 Preventing underinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff with a portable elastomeric device.

Underinflation could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia [1] whereas overinflation exposes to tracheal damage [2]. Multi-daily check and adjustment is recommended to ensure that Pcufflies between 20 and 30 cmH2O [3]. To automate this task some devices exist but may be inconvenient, bulky and/or ineffective. Their use is not supported by guidelines. A portable elastomeric device could be appealing for Pcuffautomated regulation. This prospective randomized controlled study tested whether the Tracoe Smart Cuff ManagerTMreduced the rate of patients undergoing ≥1 episode of underinflation (Pcuff<20 cmH2O), as compared with routine manual Pcuffadjustment.Methods:Monocentric, randomized controlled study. Patients with acute brain injury and receiving mechanical ventilation were prospectively allocated to one of the two arms: manual reading and adjustment of Pcuffat least every 8h (routine care) or adjunction of the Smart Cuff ManagerTM(intervention). This study was approuved by an institutional review board.Results:Among 60 randomized patients (routine care in 32, Smart Cuff ManagerTMin 28), 506 measurements were performed in 48h. With routine care, a higher rate of patients experienced at least one episode of underinflation (62.5 vs. 17.8%;p<0.001). Episodes of underinflation episodes (15% vs. 2%;p<0.001) and manual adjustments (77% vs. 56%;p<0.001) were more frequent with routine care. For overinflation, there was no between-arms difference (p>0.99).Conclusions:The adjunction of continuous Pcuffcontrol with the Tracoe Smart Cuff ManagerTMreduced the incidence of Pcuffunderinflation as compared with manual intermittent adjustments. Overinflation was not promoted by this device.References:1. Rello J. et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 154:111-5, 19962. Nseir S et al. Crit Care 11:R109, 20073. Leone et al.

Patients in ICU underwent PT with assistance of fiberoptic bronchosce, or ST in the operating room, due to the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Ultrasound Doppler examination of the blood vessels in the neek and their relationship with trachea determined the indication for PT or ST. In PT group were 110 patients, in ST 51. We have observed early and late complications and lenght of mechanical ventilation after the tracheostomy was performed.Results:On most patients (110) we have made PT assisted by fiberoptic bronchoscope. 51 patients underwent ST. Early complications in PT in terms of minor bleeding (<100ml) from the smaller vein blood vessels of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the neek were 3,6% during the performance. Serious complication, false route, subcutaneous cannula placement, with subcutaneous emphysema was 0,9%. The late complications of PT in the form of tracheal stenosis are still being monitored, and no reports have been reported so far. Early complications in ST( bleeding, twisting cannula as well as malposition) were 20%.Conclusions:PT with assistance of fiberoptic bronchoscop has proven to be a safe and rapid invasive method, with no more complication than ST, in the ICU performed by ICU doctors on patients, in bed without transport to the operating room and as a safe alternative to ST.P114 A comparison of the intersurgical i-View and Macintosh laryngoscope when used by novice personnel: a manikin studyMO O´Sullivan1, EO Imhoff-O´Mahony21Mercy University Hospital, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Cork, Ireland;2Sligo University Hospital, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Sligo, IrelandIntroduction:Direct laryngoscopy as a technique for tracheal intubation is a potentially lifesaving procedure that healthcare professionals in a variety of fields are taught. However, this skill is challenging to acquire and difficult to maintain. Poorly performed intubation technique can lead to potentially serious complications [1]. The Intersurgical iView video laryngoscope is a new intubation tool which may have advantages over direct laryngoscopes, such as the Macintosh, in the hands of novice personnel.Methods:A prospective randomized counterbalanced trial of 30 medical students, who did not have previous airway management experience, was conducted.

To date, there are no clear parameters that predict a positive response to APRV. The purpose of our study was to identify these.Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study in a single, large tertiary adult ICU from 2015-2018. Demographic, pathological and physiological data were extracted from the clinical information system CareVue ©. APRV responders were defined as patients remaining on APRV at four hours post initiation with a positive change in PF ratio. The cohort was stratified by responder status; univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with APRV response. Figures are mean (SD). Anonymized data was stored in a password-protected, securely stored computer file.Results:103 patients mean age 53.4 (15.5) were ventilated using APRV and 96 fulfilled inclusion criteria. 55% were male, 61% had a primary pulmonary pathology.

Closed circuits were developed to prevent arterial desaturation and atelectasis associated to ventilator disconnection. However, CES may cause substantial loss of lung volume. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a compensation method to prevent the loss in aeration during CES.Methods:The suctioning technique was performed for 15 seconds, negative pressures limited at 150 mmHg. Closed suction catheters with 14Fr (Halyard Health, Georgia, EUA) were used. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitoring and arterial blood gas were collected. A NihonKoden Mechanical Ventilator (NKV550, California, EUA) was applied, having a newly developed algorithm for suctioning which overcomes any pressure loss during suctioning (InlineSuction-APP). When activated, the APP delivers PCV ventilation, adding 2 cmH2O of end-expiratory pressure above PEEP, and delivering driving pressures of 15 cmH2O.Results:Pigs (30±5.4kg) with injured lungs and mechanically ventilated. We tested the aspiration procedures using low PEEP=5cmH2O, or high PEEP=±12.3cmH2O with VT2O), whereas maintenance of compliance was observed when the APP was ON (from12.2±1.4 ml/cmH2O to 12.5±4.5 ml/cmH2O. Blood gas in a representative animal showed a drop in PaO2when APP was off (from 247, to 149 mmHg after 2 min, and to 176 mmHg after 10 min) (Figure 1). With APP ON the PaO2changed from 259 (pre-suction), to 223 (2 min), to 253 mmHg (10 min).Conclusions:The new NKsoftware, delivering PCV ventilation during suctioning, could prevent atelectasis and functional loss associated to the procedure.Fig. 1 (abstract P116).Representative image showing the ventilation maps before and after closed endotracheal suctioning (CES).

In the last two decades, targeted therapies have changed the prognostic of patients with lung cancer outside the ICU. The fast efficacy of targeted therapies led some intensivists to use them as rescue therapy for ICU patients.Methods:We performed a national multicentric retrospective study with the participation of the GRRROH (Groupe de Recherche en Réanimation Respiratoire en Onco-Hématologie). All patients with non-small-cell lung cancer admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure between 2009 and 2019 were included in the study if a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor was initiated during ICU stay. Cases were identified using hospital-pharmacies records. The primary outcome was overall survival 90 days after ICU admission.Results:Thirty patients (age: 60+/-14 years old) admitted to a total of 14 ICUs throughout France were included. Seventeen patients (59%) were nonsmoker. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent histological type (n=21, 70%). Most patients had metastatic cancer (n=21, 70%). Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor mutation was the most common oncologic driver identified (n=16, 53%). During the ICU stay, 17 (57%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) catecholamine infusion, 3 (10%) renal replacement therapy and one (3%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Eighteen patients (60%) were discharged alive from ICU and 11 (37%) were still alive after 90 days (see Figure). Moreover, 6 patients (20%) were alive one year after ICU discharge.Conclusions:Despite a small sample size this study showed that, in the context of lung cancer involvement responsible for acute respiratory failure, the use of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor should not be refrained in patients with severe condition in ICU.Fig. 1 (abstract P117).Probability of survival after ICU admissionP118 Community-acquired pneumonia: factors predicting poor outcomeC"

However, the variability in dose delivery to the lung across the possible patient interventions is not well characterized. Here, we assess the predicted lung dose of a bronchodilator in a simulated spontaneously breathing adult patient via both facemask and nasal cannula, and via tracheostomy during mechanical ventilation.Methods:A standard dose of 2.5 mg in 2.5 mL salbutamol was aerosolized using the Aerogen Solo nebulizer (Aerogen, Ireland). For facemask testing, the nebulizer was used in combination with the Aerogen Ultra with 2LPM supplemental oxygen flow. For nasal cannula testing, the nebulizer was used in combination with the Airvo 2 system (Fisher and Paykel, NZ) system at both 10 and 50LPM gas flow rate. Tracheostomy-mediated ventilation was assessed in combination with a HME, with the nebulizer placed between the HME and the tracheostomy tube. International Standard ISO27427 adult breath settings (Vt 500mL, BPM 15, I:E 1:1) were used across all tests, and generated using a breathing simulator (ASL5000, Ingmar Medical, USA) or mechanical ventilator (Servo-U, Maquet, Sweden).

They have two to four times increased mortality from ischemic heart disease and one fourth of patients develop pulmonary embolism particularly during acute exacerbations. The aim of the study was to demonstrate whether these patients’ underlying inflammatory response promotes thrombotic risk using the functional biomarker (fractal dimension-df). The stable COPD patients were divided into four groups based on their Forced Expiratory Volume at one second (FEV1); mild (>80%), moderate (50-80%), severe (30-50%) and very severe (<30%).Methods:30 stable ambulatory COPD patients with no evidence of infection or any underlying disease process that affect their coagulation system where recruited from the chest clinic of a tertiary teaching hospital. Blood samples were taken to perform fractal dimension (df), full blood count, platelet aggregometry, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, CRP and Factor XIII.Results:The mean dfin stable COPD patients was 1.690 (normal df1.73 ± 0.04).

This study was conducted in order to assess the results of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) modalities in lung cancer patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure (ARF).Methods:In this study, lung cancer patients with respiratory failure who were admitted to the ICU between January 2017 and December 2018 were evaluated retrospectively.Results:93 patients were included in the study. The mortality rate was 18.3%. 83 patients had NIV. IMV was applied to 10 patients. In the first 24 hours, 39 of the 83 patients who were initially treated with NIV were administered IMV. The duration of hospital stay, diagnosis of pneumonia and mortality rate were found to be significantly lower in patients treated with NIV alone (p≤0.001, p=0.004, p=0.025), but Glaskow Coma Score (GCS) was significantly higher in this group (p≤0.001). The mortality rate was similar between the patients who were initially treated with IMV and those who were treated with IMV in the first 24 hours. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and MV duration were significantly higher in patients who died (p=0.01, p=0.021), but GCS was significantly lower in this group (p=0.032).

This study aimed at investigating the effect of stepwise increase in PEEP level on the risk of acute kidney injury as evaluated with the renal resistivity index (RRI).The primary outcome is to investigate whether increased levels of PEEP could lead to increase RRI and whether RRI could predict the occurrence of AKI.Methods:Patients mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours and without AKI at admission were included in the study. RRI was calculated at ICU admission. Posterolateral approach was used for kidney ultrasound. The peak systolic velocity (Vmax) and the minimal diastolic velocity (Vmin) were determined by pulse wave Doppler, and the RRI was calculated as (Vmax-Vmin)/Vmax. The exam was performed modifying the PEEP levels: 5, 10 and 15 cm H2O in random order for 15 minutes. Occurrence of AKI was defined within 7 days according to KDIGO criteria.Results:Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study and incidence of AKI was 14/64 (22%). Demographical and clinical characteristics are reported in Table 1. Increase in PEEP showed a significant increase in RRI from PEEP 5 to PEEP 10 (p<0.001) and from PEEP 10 to PEEP 15 (p=0.001) (Figure 1). The area under the ROC curve of RRI to predict AKI was 0.845 at PEEP 5, 0.898 at PEEP 10 and 0.894 at PEEP 15 (all p<0.001). The Youden index analysis showed an RRI>0.70 as the best cut off for AKI with a sensibility of 65% and a specificity of 96%. Patients with RRI>0.70 were 11/64 (17%), 13/64 (20%) and 22/64 (34%) at PEEP 5,PEEP 10 and PEEP 15 respectively. Patients ventilated with a PEEP value associated with RRI>0.70 had higher incidence of AKI (11/14 vs 6/50, p<0.001).Conclusions:The application of PEEP can increase intrarenal vascular resistance,which is associated occurrence of AKI; PEEP level should therefore be balanced taking into account the RRI.

Four groups were established: FiO20.21, 0.4, 0.6 and 1. After 4 hours, the lungs were removed for histological study and obtaining the wet/dry index. The histological modifications studied were: alveolar septa (AS), alveolar hemorrhages (AH), intraalvelolar fibrin (IF) and inflammatory infiltrates (II). Each parameter was rated from 0 to 3 [2]. Peak pressure (Pp) and pulmonary compliance were monitored every 60 minutes. Different statistical tests will be used to analyze the data.Results:References to the damage produced in the AS, AH, IF, II and the global histological pattern were identified in the groups with the highest FiO2and there was more damage (p <0.00001) (Figure 1). The wet/dry index rose significantly as the oxygen concentration increased (p = 0.001). In the groups to which a FiO2of 0.6 and 1 was administered, the Pp selected specific values with respect to the baseline intake from the first 60 minutes, an aspect that was not appreciated in the other groups (p <0.0001). Regarding pulmonary compliance, it will be seen that, in the FiO20.6 and 1 groups, it decreased from the first 60 minutes, finding differences with respect to the other groups (p <0.0001).Conclusions:Mechanical ventilation applied for 4 hours in healthy animals produces disorders that are more pronounced as oxygen concentration increase. FiO2greater than or equal to 0.6 should be avoided without clinical justification.References:1. Hedenstierna G et al. Intensive Care Med Oct:1-4, 20192. Matute-Bello G et al.

Using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes we identified PAMV and STMV patients, and compared their baseline characteristics and hospital events. Because of the large sample size, we omitted hypothesis testing.Results:A total of 691,961 patients met the enrollment criteria, of whom 266,374 (38.5%) received PAMV. At baseline, patients on PAMV were similar to STMV with regard to age (years: 62.0 ± 15.8 PAMV vs. 61.7 ± 17.2 STMV), gender (males: 55.6% PAMV vs. 53.9% STMV), and race (white: 69.1% PAMV vs. 72.4% STMV). PAMV group had a higher comorbidity burden than STMV (mean Charlson score 3.5+2.7 vs. 3.1+2.7).

Temporary transvenous diaphragm neurostimulation (TTDN) stimulates diaphragm contraction [2]. When used in synchrony with MV, TTDN encourages increased dorsal ventilation due to the change in pressure gradients with diaphragm contraction, mimicking a more normal physiological pattern. This may improve gas exchange and reduce injury.Methods:A pilot study was conducted using 50 kg pigs undergoing MV in a mock ICU. Deeply sedated subjects were provided lung-protective volume-control ventilation at 8 ml/kg. TTDN diaphragm contractions were delivered in synchrony with inspiration on every second breath, reducing the ventilator pressure-time-product by 15-20% during MV+TTDN breaths. Tidal volume distribution was recorded in each condition using electrical impedance tomography, and compared to never-ventilated, spontaneously breathing subjects (NV).Results:Dorsal ventilation changed from 49% during MV breaths to 54% during MV+TTDN breaths, compared to 60% in the NV group (p=0.035). Ventral ventilation changed from 51% during MV breaths to 46% during MV+TTDN breaths, compared to 40% in the NV group (p=0.042, Figure"

Among surgical patients, those undergoing heart surgery are particularly susceptible to cardiac dysfunction induced by weaning because of inadequate cardiovascular reserve. The aim of our study was to depict the pathophysiological changes assessed by echocardiography during the steps of weaning and to identify possible predictors of weaning failure (WF).Methods:We enrolled 34 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting in our institution. Data were obtained by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography before sternotomy (T0) and by transthoracic echocardiography at the beginning of weaning (T1) and at the time of extubation (T2). WF was defined as deferral of planned extubation or respiratory failure needing reintubation or non-invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 hours.Results:WF occurred in 7 patients (20.6%) and involved manifestations of respiratory distress in 5 (14.7%). We found a significant association between left ventricle outflow tract-velocity time integral (LVOT-VTI) and ventricular-arterial coupling measured at T1 and WF, with LVOT-VTI emerging as the best predictor of WF with an area under ROC curve of 0.8669 (Figure 1); an optimal cutoff value of 15 cm provided 100% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Significant increase in E/e’ measured at T2 (13.44 vs 9.96, P 0.02) suggested a cardiac etiology of respiratory distress in patients who failed the weaning trial.Conclusions:Our study showed that serial assessment of hemodynamic parameters by means of echocardiography is feasible in cardiac surgical patients and can provide insight into pathophysiological changes during weaning. Although these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger population sample, LVOT-VTI emerged as a promising predictor of subsequent WF.Fig. 1 (abstract P130).ROC curve of LVOT-VTI measured at the beginning of spontaneous breathing trial for weaning failureP131 Compliance with guidelines for respiratory therapy in preclinical emergency medicineG Jansen, N Kappelhoff, S RehbergProtestand Hospital of the Bethel Foundation, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, Bielefeld, GermanyIntroduction:Current guidelines on pre-hospital emergency ventilation are based on the"

The present survey was designed to determine the accordance of actual pre-hospital emergency ventilation by German emergency physicians (GEP) with these recommendations.Methods:Recommendations include a respiratory rate (RR) between 10-16/min, a tidal volume (vt) between 6-8 ml/kg, a maximum pressure (Pmax) <30 mbar and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mbar. An anonymous web-based questionnaire encompassing 7 questions was sent to GEP from September to December of 2018. GEP were asked to specify their level of education, their preferred ventilation settings and the usually chosen parameters employed to guide mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Ch²-test with a significance level ≤0.05.Results:60% of the questionnaires were completed (159/261). 25% of the participants were trainees (Tr), 75% consultants (Co).

PH often gets worse in some patients despite the normal cardiac function after TAVI. No studies have ever examined prognosis after TAVI in patients with or without worsening of PH. Therefore, we retrospectively examined the frequency of mid- to long-term heart failure and cardiac death in patients with and without deterioration of PH after TAVI.Methods:Among 113 patients who underwent TAVI at our hospital between February 2014 and March 2016, we analysed 27 patients with PH (sPAP≥35 mmHg) before surgery. sPAP was measured in transthoracic echocardiography before and within 1 week after TAVI. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether sPAP worsened/did not change or improved after TAVI. We examined the frequency of admission due to heart failure or cardiac death (death caused by heart failure, angina, or myocardial infarction) during the period of 3 years after TAVI.Results:PH worsened or did not change after TAVI in 9 patients, while it improved in 18 patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured within 1 week after TAVI showed no difference between the two groups (56.6±11.9% vs 58.4±10.0%, p=0.71). The worsened/ no change group was higher in frequency of admission due to heart failure (logrank; p<0.05) and cardiac death (logrank; p<0.04).Conclusions:Despite successful treatment for AS by TAVI, the frequency of heart failure and cardiac death was higher in patients who did not show improvement of PH after TAVI, even in the absence of cardiac function decrease. Vigorous intervention for PH worsening after TAVI may be helpful to improve prognosis.P137 The anti-thrombotic effects of different P2Y12 inhibitors in the"

Currently there are no effective markers that can assess how these drugs modify coagulation profile and quality. A new functional biomarker that measures Fractal dimension (df ) and clot formation time (TGP) has been developed [1]. df quantifies clot microstructure whereas TGP is a real-time measure of clotting time. We aimed to validate df and TGP in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and assess the effect of two P2Y12 inhibitors which have different pharmacological mechanisms: clopidogrel and ticagrelor.Methods:We prospectively recruited 72 STEMI patients in the emergency setting. Venous blood samples were collected 12 hours after admission, following treatment with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel, in accordance with the local guidelines at the time. The blood samples were tested using the df and TGP biomarker, platelet aggregometry, clot contraction and standard markers of coagulation.Results:36 patients received clopidogrel and 36 received ticagrelor. The df for clopidogrel was higher than ticagrelor (1.75±0.05 vs 1.73±0.06, p=0.18 which corresponds to a decrease in clot mass of 20% Figure 1) and the TGP was reduced (205±91sec vs 257±89 sec, p=0.06 a 20% reduction in time).Conclusions:The results of the study suggest that clopidogrel is less powerful in its effects on clotting characteristics compared to ticagrelor. Blood from patients receiving clopidogrel formed quicker and denser clots. This would suggest the risk of secondary events or stent occlusion is lower in those patients on ticagrelor, highlighting that df and TGP may be important in identifying patients at risk of future thrombotic events, the study is ongoing and will investigate the long term outcome in these patients.References:1.

To bypass the disadvantages and potential complications of conventional CABG via median sternotomy, we developed the EndoCABG technique to treat patients with single- and multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). This procedure is performed with three 5-mm thoracic ports and a mini-thoracotomy utility port (3 cm) through the intercostal space. This technique can be combined with PCI: the hybrid approach. The sequence of the 2 procedures (EndoCABG followed by PCI or vice versa) may result in different outcomes.Methods:From 02/2016 to 12/2017 data from 81 consecutive patients scheduled for a hybrid technique at Jessa, Belgium, were prospectively entered into a customized database. This database was retrospectively reviewed. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare outcomes of patients who first received EndoCABG with patients who first received PCI. A p-value < 0.05 is considered significant, a p-value < 0.1 is considered as a trend toward significance.Results:Four patients underwent revision surgery and 2 patients died within the first 30 days. In 79 patients the left anterior descendens artery (LAD) was grafted with the left internal mammary artery (LIMA), the right coronary artery (RCA) was the most stented vessel using PCI. Patients first treated with PCI received more units of fresh frozen plasma after EndoCABG compared to those who were first treated with EndoCABG (p=0.03).

Pirogov, Management, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:Troponin T (cTnT) elevation in critically ill patients is common and is associated with poor outcome. Using common assays, 40-50% of patients in the ICU will have elevated troponin level. Our aim was to determine whether there is any prognostic difference between troponin elevation meeting the MI criteria (rise and fall more than 20% together with Echo and ECG new abnormalities) and troponin elevation due to myocardial injury in septic patients.Methods:We enrolled 101 patients with sepsis and mean SOFA score 5,2 respectively in which cTnT level was measured more than once and analyzed there ECG and Echo findings. Patients were classified into three groups:definite MI (rise and fall cTnT ≥ 20% and contemporaneous changes on ECG and/or Echo),possible MI (rise and fall cTnT ≥ 20% and no other findings),myocardial injury (cTnT rise less than 20%)Results:Data from 101 patients were analyzed (49% female; mean age 61.9 (SD 16.9)). A total of 101 patients had at least one elevated cTnT more than 0.03 mkg/l. In 71 (70%) of patients cTnT level rised more than 20% from the first elevated measurement.64 (63%) of patients met MI criteria considering new ECG and Echo findings. The overall mortality rate in all patients was 53.9%.The mortality rate didn’t differ significantly in three groups: in the definite MI group 62.4%, in the suspected MI group 52%, in the non MI cTnT elevation group 56,4%, p=0,6. Coronary angiography was performed in 46 (73%) of patients from the definite MI group,PCI was performed in 18 (39%) of patients. The mortality rate in the invasive group was not significantly lower comparing to the nonivasive group 29% vs 37,8%, p=0,06. Bleeding complications were significantly more frequent in the definite MI group 13% vs 7% and 8% respectivelyConclusions:cTnT level elevation is associated with poor outcome regardless coronary or non coronary injury. Myocardial revascularization may be beneficial in patients with sepsis and definite MI, but it is also associated with increased bleeding risk.P143 Diagnostic interest of \"Marburg Heart Score\" in patient consulting the emergencies department for acute chest painNE Nouira1, M Lehyeni1, A"

The aim was to validate the Marburg Heart Score as a tool to exclude coronary artery disease in emergency department patients with non-traumatic acute chest pain.Methods:a prospective, observational, descriptive and analytic cohort study conducted in the emergency department, from February 1st to March 31st, 2019, collecting patients consulting for nontraumatic acute chest pain, the \"Marburg Heart\" score was calculated for all these patients. Telephone contact was made after 6 weeks to look for an ischemic cardiovascular event.Results:We included 171 patients. The mean age was 57 +/- 13 years, the sex ratio was 0.86. The majority of the patients (78.9%) consulted directly to the emergency department, 21.1% were referred by a primary care physician. The median time to consultation after the onset of chest pain was 24 hours. High blood pressure was the most common risk factor (43.9%), followed by smoking (31%), diabetes (24.8%) and dyslipidemia (23.4%). Thirty-five patients (20.5%) had already coronary heart disease, ECG was pathological in 19.3% of patients, 8 patients had an ACS with ST segment elevation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of ultrasound-assessed muscle mass, in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery that present muscle weakness postoperatively.Methods:For this study, 221 consecutive patients were enrolled, following their admission in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit (ICU) within 24 hours of cardiac surgery. Ultrasound scans, for the assessment of quadriceps muscle thickness, were performed every 48 hours for 7 days. Muscle strength was also evaluated in parallel, using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.Results:Of the 221 patients enrolled, ultrasound scans and muscle strength assessment were performed in 165 patients. The muscle thickness of rectus femoris (RF), was slightly decreased by 2.18% ([95%CI: -0.21; 0.15], n=9; p=0.729) and the combined muscle thickness of the vastus intermedius (VI) and RF decreased by 3.5% ([95% CI: -0.4; 0.22], n=9; p=0.530).

In the preoperative period, the risk of cardiovascular incidents was assessed using the revised Lee index and the functional status was assessed by MET. Depending on the Lee index, 3 groups were identified: group 1 (n = 69) - low risk (index value - 1), group 2 (n = 52) - intermediate risk (index value -2); group 3 (n = 23) - high risk (index value> 3). We estimated the incidence of critical incidents in groups: hypo-, hypertension, arrhythmias, and bradycardia.Results:In the general population, cardiac risk was 2.2 ± 0.7 points; functional status - 7.7 ± 1 MET. The greatest number of critical incidents was recorded in patients with high risk (58.4%), the smallest - in patients with low risk (9.1%), in patients with intermediate risk - 26.5% (n <0, 05 between groups according to Chi-square criterion). In the structure of critical incidents, hypotension was most often encountered - in 62 (43%) patients, while some patients revealed several incidents from the circulatory system (n = 116). Overall, the Lee scale showed good prognostic ability (AUROC = 0.81) in predicting hemodynamic incidents.Conclusions:The revised Lee index is a useful tool to help assess the risk of cardiovascular incidents and determine patient management tactics in the perioperative period.References:1.

Mortality is frequent following cardiac ischemia in the intensive care unit (ICU) after non-cardiac surgery.Methods:The first group includes patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for post-operative follow-up without myocardiac ischemia in the first 24 hours. The second group includes patients with myocardiac ischemia postoperatively and needs intensive care monitoring. Cardiac risk assessment was made with the Lee Index,hemorrhagic risk assessment with the HAS-BLED bleeding score and thrombotic risk assessment with CHA2DS2-VASc score. Postoperatively, pathological test values such as BNP, troponin, CRP, calcitonin were estimated. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) systeme was used to assess sepsis. The Nursing Activity Score (NAS) scale was used to measure the workload of various nursing activities in the ICU.Results:According to the pilot study, the sample consists of 35 patients. 31.4% had myocardial ischemia. The Lee index was significantly higher in patients with myocardial ischemia. The duration of hospitalization, the high dose of vasoconstrictive drugs, the length of stay in the ICU, the duration of mechanical stay and the nursing workload were higher in patients with myocardial ischemia.

Most common cause of death was problem with respiration and airway obstruction [3]. Subsequent hypoxia could require emergency airway and even tracheostomy [3]. Aim of our study was to determine the most common of airway complications and their association with type of surgery in our region.Methods:The retrospective cohort study included 400 pts., (369 women, 31 men) was performed in Odessa regional Hospital, Oncology Centre Odessa. There were three types of patients: with euthyroid goiter - 170 (43%), polynodos goiter - 125(31%) and thyroid cancer - 105 (26%) (Table 1). Airway complications were diagnosed after trachea extubation based on indirect laryngoscope, presence of stridor, desaturation. The Pearson’s criteria was calculated.Results:The ratio of airway complications after thyroid surgery was 9.7% (39 pts). The main reasons of airway complications in thyroid surgery included: laryngeal edema - 22 pts (5.5%); recurrent laryngeal nerve injury - 12 pts (3.0%) and postoperative bleeding 5 pts (1.2%).Conclusions:Thyroid gland cancer and polynodosal goiter associated with laryngeal edema and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (Pearsen criteria were 0.271 -moderate and 0.203 consequentially).

The objective was to determine the level of serum iron in the perioperative period in patients with endoprosthetics of large joints, and with the presence of MODS in abdominal surgery.Methods:A prospective cohort study was conducted in 77 patients, including 18 men and 59 women, age 61.9 ± 15.1 years. Two groups were identified: 1st (control) - patients after endoprosthetics of large joints (n = 40), 2nd (main) - patients in abdominal surgery with the presence of MODS (n = 37). The presence of MODS was established based on the criteria for the 2016 SCCM / ACCP Conference. Serum iron was monitored using an AU 680 analyzer (USA). The study identified several stages: 1st - before surgery, 2nd - 1st day after surgery, 3rd - 3rd day, 4th - 7th day, 5th - 10th day.Results:When studying the indicators of serum iron, its significant decrease (p <0.05) in the postoperative period was established. In the 1st group: 1st stage - 15.2 (10-19.4) mmol / L, 2nd stage - 5.2 (3.9-7.6) mmol / L, 3rd stage - 6.6 (5-8.7) μmol / L, stage 4 - 9.7 (8.6-12.1) μmol / L, stage 5 - 9.4 (7.8-11 9) μmol / L.

Moreover, in both groups, iron increased at the 4th stage against the 2nd stage (p <0.05). When comparing the level of iron between the groups, significant differences were found (p <0.05) at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th stages.Conclusions:In patients in the postoperative period, a decrease in serum iron is observed, the level of which rises by the 7th day, but does not reach the initial values.

The increasing success is a result of improved surgical technique, better organ preservation, potent immunosuppression therapy and effective use of antibiotics. Nevertheless, morbidity and mortality following SPK transplantation remain high, mainly owing to infection [1].Methods:Retrospective analysis of patients admitted for SPK transplantation from 2013-2018 in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Donor’s mean age 34.6±11.6 years. Kidney and pancreatic graft thrombosis happened in 5.6% and 18.9%, respectively, and bleeding in 21.1%. Forty-one (45.6%) developed at least one infection during hospital stay. Infection during ICU was found in 13.3% and main pathogens were gram negative bacilli sensible to beta-lactam. After ICU, the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogen was 13.5%, predominantly gram negative bacilli. Fungal infection was lower 4%. All-cause hospital mortality rate was 5.6%.Conclusions:Infectious complications are the main cause of morbidity and mortality following SPK transplantation. The administration of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics are leading to the appearance of multi-drug resistant pathogens. Knowing local microbiological flora may be helpful, allowing more adequate antibiotic prophylaxis.References:1. Michalak G et al.

Its early diagnosis requires an elevated index of suspiction, particularly in more severe patients. We hypothesized that earlier increase and higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) may help to predict intra-abdominal ischemia.Methods:We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted to the intensive care department (ICD) after abdominal aorta aneurism surgery. We included all patients admitted during a two-year period, that survived for more than 48 hours. Primary outcome was splanchnic ischemia assessed by abdominal CT-scan. We also evaluated the presence of bacteremia, abdominal compartment syndrome and ICD mortality. Association between inflammatory parameters and ischemia was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression.Results:We included 88 patients (47 elective and 41 emergent) admitted to the ICD after major abdominal vascular surgery. Mean age was 71.0 ± 8.6 and 90% were male. Mean SAPS II value was 44.4 ± 20.6 and admission SOFA 6.7 ± 4.5. CRP levels increased after surgery with peak level at day 3 (26.01 ± 11.3 mg/dL). Suspicion of systemic infection occurred in 19 patients, but none of them had positive blood cultures. Mesenteric ischemia was confirmed in 20 patients (23%); at day 1, there was a higher CRP value in patients that developed ischemia (13.5±8.8mg/dL in ischemia group vs 8.1 ±5.1 mg/dL in non ischemia; p=0.004), as well as in day 3 (p=0.003). These differences remained after adjustment for patient severity, with an OR=1.1 (1.0-1.1; p=0.04).

Gastrectomy is a high-risk surgical procedure that requires post-operative critical care support to monitor for complications which are predominantly infective in nature. The aims of this study were to determine whether there is a relationship between post-operative CRP levels and patients who developed post-operative infective complications.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed on patients undergoing elective gastrectomy for gastric cancer at a single centre between September 2011 and July 2016. Post-operative CRP levels for each day following resection were analysed for all patients. ROC curve analysis was used to determine which post-operative day (POD) gave the optimal cut-off.Results:Of 144 patients included, the majority were male (61.8%), mean age was 68.5 years and 53.5% had node-negative disease. A total of 84 patients (58.3%) had an infective complication, which includes those who experienced an anastomotic leak. CRP levels on post-operative day 3 gave the greatest AUC for the gastrectomy group (0.765). CRP cut-off of 220mg/L was significantly associated with infective complications (OR7.29, 95% CI 3.42-15.58, p= <0.001) and gave a sensitivity of 70% and specificity 76% (PPV 67%, NPV 78%). More patients with a CRP >220 on post-operative day 3 experienced an infective complication (67% vs 21%, p = <0.001) or a leak in particular (17% vs 6%, p = 0.059).Conclusions:A CRP level of less than 220 mg/L on POD3 may be useful to predict the development or exclude the likelihood of such infective complications in this group of patients prior to clinical signs (PPV 67%, NPV 78%). This may prompt and facilitate decision-making regarding early investigation and intervention or prevent inappropriate early discharge from critical care, whilst providing more assurance in identifying those who could be stepped down to ward level care.P156 Renin in cardiopulmonary bypass-associated vasoplegic syndromeMM Juarez1, SJ Pearson1, BM Morrissey1, NW Flemming2, P Devarajan3, LS Chawla4, TE Albertson11University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Sacramento, United States;2University of California, Davis School of Medicine,"

Chronic use of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) is associated with its incidence and ensuing need for vasopressor support after CPB. Renin serves as marker of tissue perfusion [1]. We examined the role of renin in the setting of RAASi exposure and vasopressor needs in the peri-CPB period.Methods:Prospective observational study of 31 adult patients undergoing CPB, aged 66.0±10.5 years (22 men, 9 women). Blood was collected 1) post induction, pre-CPB; 2) 30 min post cardioplegia, and 3) immediately post bypass. Vital signs and perioperative medications were recorded. As control, blood was collected from 5 men and 4 women aged 53.5 ±10.7, not diagnosed with lung disease and not prescribed any RAASi.Results:Baseline plasma renin in CPB patients tended to be higher than in control subjects (mean=38.5pg/ml±9.2 vs. 17.1 pg/ml ± 3.5, respectively, p=0.670). 30 minutes into CPB, mean renin was increased from baseline (77.6 pg/ml±17.5, p=0.211), and remained elevated immediately post CPB (74.6 pg/ml±19.1). Patients using RAASi prior to CPB tended to have a larger increase in renin post CPB (delta=55.3 pg/ml±30.9) vs. those not previously on RAASi (26.9 pg/ml±9.5, p=0.092). Renin was elevated in patients requiring vasopressor support in the 24 hours post CPB vs. those not requiring pressors (41.4 pg/ml±15.7 vs. 25.1 pg/ml±16.1 p=0.0246). In those prescribed RAASi and requiring pressors post CPB, there was a tendency toward greater renin increase than those not requiring pressors postoperatively (49.9 pg/ml±49.7 vs. 8.5 pg/ml±3.9, p=0.036).Conclusions:This study suggests a trend toward higher renin levels, particularly during CPB, in patients prescribed RAASi, and a positive association between renin and postoperative vasopressor needs. We speculate that increased renin levels may predict postoperative vasoplegia.References:1. Gleeson PJ et al.

We assessed the influence of pre-operative anticoagulant medication for blood loss. Estimated average blood loss after conventional CABG3is 400ml (+/-200) and transfusion requirement 3,4 units packed red blood cells4.Methods:We performed a retrospective cohort study of our cardiac surgical database. From 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2017, we collected data from 423 patients undergoing endo-CABG. We analyzed blood loss, transfusion as well as pre-operative use of anti-coagulants as a risk factor for blood loss.Results:We found that mean total blood loss in endo-CABG does not differ from conventional CABG, nonetheless mean transfusion requirement was lower in our cohort. Use of direct oral anticoagulant is aossciated with increased blood loss and transfusion requirements (Table 1).Conclusions:Total blood loss is not influenced by minimal invasive technique for CABG (endo-CABG). An explanation for the lower transfusion requirements is the use of a minimal extracorporeal circulation, which is known to reduce the risk of transfusion. Another important factor is the implementation of a standardized transfusion-protocol based on available evidence. Reducing transfusion requirements is an important component in improving patient outcome after cardiac surgery and is related to multiple factors in perioperative care of our patients.Table 1 (abstract P157).Use of pre-operative anti-coagulant medicationTotal transfusion (blood) (units)Total blood loss (ml)Total group (n=423)0.7 ± 3.07 0 (0, 0)428.2 ± 343.3 314.5 (247.8, 499.3)Use of pre-operative medicationNumber of patients (%)Blood loss (ml)Total transfusion blood (units)No pre-operative treatment46 (10.8%)480.8 ± 449.9 354 (257.5, 540)1.62 ± 7.8 0 (0, 0)NOAC24 (5.6%)542 ±435.6 343.5 (250, 671.5)2.62 ± 5.64 0 (0, 3)ASA346 (81.7%)424.8 ±336.8 306.5 (247, 492.8)0.60 ± 1.85 0 (0, 0)API107 (25.9%)411.6 ± 309.6 295 (244, 523)0.89 ± 1.58 0 (0, 1.25)ASA + API89 (21 %)426.2 ± 334.1 300 (244.5, 530.5)0.97 ± 1.56 0 (0, 2)P158 Retinal microvascular damage associated with mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass surgeryV Shipulin1, M Dyakova1, Y Podoksenov2, E Shishneva2, Y Svirko3, M Denisko4, O Krivosheina4, I Mandel51Cardiology Research Institute,, Cardiosurgery, Tomsk, Russia;2Cardiology Research Institute,, ICU, Tomsk, Russia;3Cardiology Research Institute,, Laboratory, Tomsk, Russia;4Siberian State Medical University, Ophthalmology, Tomsk, Russia;5Sechenov University, Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:Retinal perfusion corresponds to cerebral perfusion and it is very sensitive to"

We investigated the association between retinal microvascular damage and hemodynamic characteristics in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Methods:10 patients with coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension were examined. Ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography were performed before and 10-14 days after CABG. The hemodynamic parameters during CPB were analyzed.Results:4 (40%) patients had changes in the retinal vessels and in the ganglionic fiber structure on 10-14 day after surgery: in 30% of patients the foci of ischemic retinal oedema appeared, in 10% the decrease of the thickness of ganglionic fiber were observed. These changes may be associated with intraoperative ischemia of the central retinal artery. In 6 (60%) patients the mean arterial pressure (MAP) during CPB was increased up to 90 mmHg. In 4 (67%) of them the association between MAP and foci of ischemic retinal oedema were revealed. The ischemic retinal changes were observed significantly more often if the delta of MAP during CPB was over then 20 mm Hg compared with the patients where the delta of MAP was less than 20 mm Hg (p=0.035). This is probably due to an intraoperative disorders of the myogenic mechanism of blood flow autoregulation in the retinal microvasculature in patients with coronary artery disease [3].Conclusions:The level of MAP up to 90 mm Hg during CPB is associated with retinal blood flow impairment and the foci of ischemic retinal oedema. Delta of MAP more than 20 mmHg was associated with the foci of ischemic retinal oedema and decreased ganglionic fiber thickness in 67% of cases.References:1. Ascione R et al.

We aimed to implement an AFACS prevention care bundle based on a recently published practice advisory [1], focusing on early postoperative (re)introduction of β-blockers.Methods:Baseline AFACS incidence and β-blocker administration practices in our centre were audited for all patients undergoing valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) during a 6 weeks period. The AFACS prevention care bundle – an easy to follow graphical tool – was subsequently introduced to the cardiac ICU by a multidisciplinary team and audited following a model of improvement approach. After exclusion of patients with preoperative AF, differences between pre- and post-implementation groups were compared with Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical, and One-way ANOVA for continuous variables, using SPSS.Results:A total of 384 patients were analysed. Patient and surgery characteristics did not differ between groups. Significantly more patients received postoperative β-blockers after bundle implementation (82.7% pre- vs 91.3% post-bundle, p=0.019) with a higher proportion on day 1 (36.7% pre- vs 67% post-bundle, p<0.001, Figure 1).

There was an association between an extended period of HM (> 48 hours) and the need for pulmonary vasodilator therapy post Norwood procedure.Conclusions:Hypoxic gas mixture in patients with parallel systemic and pulmonary cicrculations causes desaturation and hypoxia. It does not lead to an increase in systemic perfusion and thus an improvement in systemic oxygen delivery. Its ongoing use in this fragile population should be considered.P161 Multimodal analgesia in neurocritical care patients: complementing therapies to reduce the use of endovenous opioidsM Canitrot1, J Ramirez2, J Serra3, Y Santos3, V Munoz3, F Paravic4, S Ugarte31INDISA CLINIC, Critical Care, Santiago, Chile;2Andres Bello University, NeuroICU, Santiago, Chile;3INDISA CLINIC, NeuroICU, Santiago, Chile;4INDISA CLINIC, Neurorehabilitation, Santiago, ChileIntroduction:Analgesia in the critical patient, and especially in the neurocritical patient, is a basic goal in all therapeutic practices. Patients in the ICU are frequently administered prolonged and/or high doses of opioids. Multiple serious complications due to the use of infusion of opioids at large doses has been described. To reduce high doses of intravenous opioids, multimodal forms of analgesia can be used.Methods:Prospective observational study of the use of tapentadol enteral and buprenorphine in transdermal patches, at low doses, for the control of pain and its effect on reducing the use of fentanyl infusion in high doses on 84 patients admitted to Neuro ICU of INDISA Clinic during 2 consecutive years (2018-19). Enteral tapentadol (through NG tube) 50 mg/6 hours, was considered in patients who required intravenous fentanyl in continuous administration. Buprenorphine was also added at low doses (5 ug/hr) in a weekly transdermal patch, in cases of neurosurgical spine patients, fractures and long-term neuropathic pain. Pain was controlled on Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and Visual Analogical Scale (VAS) scores, according to the conditions of each patient. Their hemodynamic, gastrointestinal complications and the appearance of delirium episodes according to CAM-ICU scale were recorded.Results:84 patients received tapentadol. 32 of them also received transdermal buprenorphine.

The nursing and medical team received rigorous training on the guideline as well as the correct assessment using appropriate pain scores measured at least hourly (Numeric Pain Score, ≥ 2 is moderate to severe or Critical Care Observation Tool, > 2 is moderate to severe). We introduced a multimodal approach with a combination of fast acting iv, long acting oral opiates, regular paracetamol and rescue iv boluses for difficult to control situations and we created a prescription bundle on our electronic prescribing record. Among other variables we assessed hours spent in moderate to severe pain in the first 24h after surgery and compared to the data collected before the guideline was introduced.Results:We analysed 101 patients from 2018 and 99 from 2019. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. In 2018 only 41.6% of the patients spent less than 5 hours and 29.4% spend more than 10 hours in moderate to severe pain. The 2019 data showed significant improvement in that 79.5% of patients spent less than 5 hours and only 5% patients who spent more than 10 hours in moderate or severe pain. (p <0.0001, Chi Square) (Figure 1).

Perioperative pain management influence outcomes and mortality after surgery with early mobilization being possible [1, 2]. The goal of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the compartment psoas block for perioperative analgesia in elderly patients with proximal femur fractures.Methods:The randomized controlled study was held in medical center \"Into-Sana\" (Odesa, Ukraine) from January 2018 till July 2019. Patients with proximal femur fractures and older than 60 years were included in the study. They were randomly allocated to 2 groups – compartment psoas block group (bupivacaine analgesia was started as soon as possible before surgery and prolonged during and after surgery with additional ischiadicus block before surgery) and general (inhalational) anesthesia with systemic analgesia perioperatively.Results:60 patients were included in this study. Perioperative compartment psoas block was associated better pain control, decreased opioid consumption, better sleep quality, earlier mobilization after surgery, decreased incidence of opioid-associated vomiting/nausea and myocardial injury. There were no difference in the incidence of hospital acquired pneumonia and delirium.Conclusions:Perioperative compartment psoas block is effective and safe for perioperative analgesia in elderly patients with proximal femur fractures, and is associated with better pain control and decreased complications incidence.References:1.

FICB is a simple safe method, easy to learn and use. The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy and safety of preoperative FICB compared with intravenous analgesia for elderly patients with femoral fracture and hip surgery in terms of opioid consumption and perioperative morbidityMethods:After informed consent obtained,54 patients 50-98 yo ASA I-III with hip fracture were randomized to receive either an US guided FICB(40 ml of ropivacaine 0,35%) or a sham injection with normal saline 30' before surgery.

Average age: in MCS group 31,8±11,29 and 42,1±8,46 in VS/UWS group. Neurological status was assessed using CRS-R scale. The average score on the CRS-R scale was 5±1.4 in VS/UWS and 10.45±4.5 in MCS. Pressure on the nail phalanx was used as a pain impulse. ANI and Nociception coma scale was evaluated before the application of pain stimulus, immediately after and past 30 minutes. Prolactin level was measured before the pain stimulus application and 10 minutes after. ANI less than 50 indicates pain, 70-100 hypoalgesia, 30 severe pain.Results:The mean value of the ANI in MCS patients: before the pain stimulus 66.25±14.11, after the pain stimulus application 45±16.12 and 30 minutes later 66.55±18.13. Prolactin level in MCS patients before pain 13.01±9.06 ng/ml; after pain 13.75±8.73 ng/ml (p>0.05). Prolactin in VS/UWS patients before pain 10.79±7.2 ng /ml, after pain 14.5 ±8.88 ng / ml (p> 0.05).Conclusions:ANI monitor revealed that VS/UWS and MCS patients react equally to the pain impulse. Prolactin dynamics showed poor statistical mean and can not be consider as a marker of nociception in this group of patients. It is possible that the level of pain impulse was insufficient neuroendocrine response activation or the increase of prolactin level occurs in the long term (more than 10 minutes). In all patients the basal level of the ANI index was above 66.25, which indicates absence of pronounced pain sensations at rest, but medical manipulations, physical therapy, can deliver pain.Acknowledgement: The reported study was funded by RFBR project number 19-29-01066/2019P167 Hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine in patients with septic shock: a cohort study of the sedation practice in intensive care evaluation [SPICE III] trialL Cioccari1, N Luethi2, M Bailey2, A Messmer1, L Peck3, B Howe2, Y Shehabi4, J Takala1, S"

Experimental data suggest that central alpha2-agonists like dexmedetomidine (DEX) increase vasopressor responsiveness and reduce catecholamine requirements in septic shock [1]. However, because it can cause hypotension and bradycardia, clinicians may be reluctant to use DEX in such patients.Methods:In this cohort study of the Sedation Practices in Intensive Care Evaluation (SPICE III) trial, an international randomized trial comparing sedation with DEX to usual care, we studied critically ill patients with septic shock admitted to the Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, and the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. The primary outcome was mean noradrenaline requirements in the first 48 hours.Results:Between November 2013 and February 2018, 417 patients were recruited into the SPICE III trial at both sites. Eighty-three patients with septic shock were included in this sub-study, of whom 44 (53%) received DEX and 39 (47%) usual care. Mean noradrenaline dose during the first 48 hours was 0.03 [0.01, 0.07] μg/kg/min in the DEX group and 0.05 [0.01, 0.15] μg/kg/min in the usual care group (p=0.08). Over the first 48 hours, patients in the DEX group had higher mean arterial pressures (MAP) (Figure 1) and lower vasopressor requirements to maintain the target MAP (expressed by the noradrenaline equivalents to MAP ratio: NEq/MAP) compared to the usual care group (ratio of adjusted difference in geometric means 1.4 [1.1, 1.9], p=0.02).Conclusions:In critically ill patients with septic shock, sedation with DEX does not increase noradrenaline requirements in the first 48 hours as compared to usual care. In contrast, DEX appears to be associated with lower vasopressor requirements to maintain the target MAP.References:1. Geloen A et al.

A too deep sedation is associated with a longer time of mechanical ventilation, lung injury, infections, neuromuscular disease and delirium, which can lead to a longer duration of ICU hospitalization, as well as an increase of morbility and mortality. Many patients spend a considerable amount of time in a non-optimal sedation level. A continuous monitoring system of the sedation level is therefore necessary to improve clinical evaluation.Methods:Our goal was to evaluate the incidence of non-optimal sedation (under and over sedation) comparing the parameters expressed from NGSedLine with clinical evaluations and to correlate oversedation and the incidence of delirium. We have studied a cohort of patients admitted to the ICU of Spedali Civili of Brescia University Hospital requiring continuous sedation for more than 12 hours.

Data on incidence and especially on predictors of delirium in patients after acute myocardial infarction (MI) are rare. By analyzing all patients after acute MI, we aim to identify incidence and potential risk factors for delirium.Methods:In this retrospective study, all patients hospitalized for acute MI treated with coronary angiography in an university hospital in 2018 were included and analyzed. Incidence of Delirium within the first 5 days of care attributed to the MI and was defined by a NuDesc Score ≥2, which is taken as part of daily care three times a day by especially trained nurses. This research is authorized by ethics committee file number 387/19.Results:626 patients with acute MI (age 68.5±13.3 years, 260 STEMI, mortality 3.4%) were analyzed. Delirium occurred in 70 (11.2%) patients and was associated with a longer hospital stay (12±15.9d vs 5.5±4.3d, p<0.001). Patients with delirium were significantly older than patients without (76.3±11.14 vs. 67.5±13.10 years, p<0.001) and had more often preexisting neurological diseases (24.3% vs. 10.8%, p<0.001) and dementia (11.4% vs. 1.4%, p<0,001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that odds ratio for delirium was higher in patients after resuscitation OR 7.5 (95% CI 2.1-26.7), preexisting dementia OR 28.9 (CI 3.1-268) and in patients with alcohol abuse OR 18 (CI 2.7-120). While maximum lactate was also connected to delirium OR 1.4 (CI 1.1-1.9), infarct size or type had no effect on the incidence of delirium.Conclusions:In patients with MI, delirium is frequent.

An unplanned and brutal stop of alcohol consumption, as it can occur during ICU admission, may lead to an alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). The most severe clinical manifestation of AWS is described as delirium tremens (DT). There are no current guidelines available for AWS treatment in ICU. The study’s aim was to describe the clinician’s practices for DT treatment and the outcome of DT in ICU patients.Methods:Observational retrospective cohort study in two ICUs of a university-affiliated, community hospital in France. Patient diagnosed for DT during their ICU stay, as defined by DSM-V classification, were enrolled in the study.Results:61 patients with DT were included between 2014 and 2017. Benzodiazepines was administered to 23% of the patients in order to prevent an AWS. As associated measures, vitamin therapy was administered to 83% of the patients and 59% had an increased fluid intake (mean 2.5L+/-0.7). Concerning the curative approach of AWS, the treatment’s heterogeneity was notable. There was a high frequency of treatment’s association (66% of the patients), every patient had benzodiazepines and the use of second line treatments such as neuroleptic, alpha-2 agonist, propofol was variable (Figure 1).Complications of DT were the following:Need for mechanical ventilation due to unmanageable agitation or acute respiratory distress (33% of the patients)Self inflicted injuries such as pulling out of central lines, tubes, surgical drain (46%)Falls (7%).Seizures (33%).Conclusions:Delirium tremens is a severe complication of an untreated AWS, which can lead to serious adverse events in ICU. The current lack of evidence concerning the management of AWS in ICU probably explains the heterogeneity of treatments. Given the potential severity of AWS in ICU, further evidences are required to optimize care of AWS in ICU patients.Fig. 1 (abstract P176).DT treatment in ICU from D0 to D5."

The Critically ill patients who are in recovery after long-term intensive care or who require monitoring after acute abdominal surgery are admitted to SDUs. Delirium in critically ill patient is common and leads to poor clinical outcomes. It is, however, preventable if its risk factors are identified and modified accordingly.Methods:To determine risk factors associated with delirium in critically ill patients to admitted surgical SDU at Asan Medical Center. This is retrospective study conducted on critically ill patients who were admitted to the SDU from September 2018 to April 2019 and able to express themselves verbally. Delirium status was determined using the Short-CAM tool. Data were analyzed by SPSS 13.0 software, using t-test, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression.Results:The incidence of delirium was 32.1%(25 of 78 patients) and hypoactive delirium(12case, 48.0%) was the most commonly assessed, followed by hyperactive delirium(9case, 36.0%), mixed type(4case, 5.1%). Risk factors associated with developing delirium identified from univariate analysis were age(P=0.048), admission via ICU (P=0.041), tracheostomy (P=0.037), chronic heart failure (CHF) (P=0.017), invasive hemodynamic monitoring (P=0.041), heart rate (P=0.037). After adjusted in multivariate analysis; factors those remained statistically significant were old age (RR 1.16, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.07-1.25, P=0.041), having a tracheostomy (RR 2.99, 95% CI=1.48-2.08, P=0.028), CHF (RR 4.01, 95% CI=1.98-5.23, P<0.001), and chronic renal failure (RR 4.45, 95% CI=1.12-3.23, P<0.001). Those were significant risk factors of delirium in SDU.Conclusions:We identified risk factors consistently associated with incidence of delirium following admitted to surgical SDU. These factors help to focus on patients at risk of developing delirium, and to develop preventive interventions that are suitable for those patients.P178 Validation of the prediction model for delirium in ICU patients (pre-deliric model) in mechanically ventilated Japanese patients with sepsisK Miyamoto1, T Nakashima1, N Shima1, S Kato1, Y Kawazoe2, Y Ohta3, T Morimoto4, H Yamamura51Wakayama Medical University, Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Wakayama, Japan;2Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Division of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Sendai, Japan;3Hyogo"

The prediction model for delirium in ICU patients (PRE-DELIRIC model) was developed to facilitate the effective preventive strategy of delirium [1]. However, the PRE-DELIRIC model has not yet been validated enough outside Europe and Australia. The aim of this study is to examine the external validity of the PRE-DELIRIC model to predict delirium using Japanese cohort.Methods:This study is a post hoc subanalysis using the dataset from previous study in nine Japanese ICUs, which have evaluated the sedative strategy with and without dexmedetomidine in adult mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis [2]. These patients were assessed daily throughout ICU stay using Confusion Assessment Method-ICU. We excluded patients who were delirious at the first day of ICU, were under sustained coma throughout ICU stay and stayed ICU less than 24 h. We evaluated the predictive ability of the PRE-DELIRIC model to measure the area under the operating characteristic curve. Calibration was assessed graphically.Results:Of the 201 patients enrolled in the original study, we analyzed 158 patients in this study. The mean age was 69.4 ± 14.0 years and 99 patients (63%) were male. Delirium occurred at least once during their ICU stay in 63 patients (40%). To predict delirium, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the PRE-DELIRIC model was 0.60 (0.50 to 0.69). Graphically, the prediction model was not well-calibrated (Figure 1).Conclusions:To predict delirium in Japanese ICUs, we could not show the well discrimination and calibration of the PRE-DELIRIC model in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis.References:1. van den Boogaard M et al.

Patients was divided for 2 groups: in D – patients with delirium treated by i/v dexmedetomidine (0.2-1.4 mkg/kg per hour), in G group patients with delirium treated by i/v galoperidol (0.10-0.15 mkg/kg). Delirium was assessed by RASS at day of permission and every day at 8 a.m. The prevalence, structure of delirium and efficacy of sedation were analysed.Results:By anthropometric and gender characteristics of the group did not differ. The average age in the D-group with delirium was 81.8±0.9 years old, which was comparable to the G-group — 79.7±0.7 years old (p = 0.06). All study participants had similar comorbidities. Delirium in all patients debuted at 2.0±1.4 days, with an average duration of 2.2±1.2 days. The effect of dexmedetomidine was better and expressed in 52% decrease in the duration of delirium in compare to haloperidol (p <0.05). Dexmedetomidine provided a more controlled and safe sedation compared with haloperidol. The average consumption of narcotic analgesics in the subgroup with dexmedetomidine was two times less than in the subgroup with haloperidol. Thus, the average consumption of trimeperidine hydrochloride in patients of group D was 6.9 mg versus 14.1 mg in group G (p = 0.004).Conclusions:In gerontological patients with femur fracture treatment delirium by dexmedetomidine was more effective in compare with haloperidol.

Thirty-two patients needed continuous intravenous vasopressors for refractory shock. The increase of FDP was significantly associated with consciousness disturbance (p=0.029) and refractory shock (p<0.0001).

We aimed to examine the effects of levosimendan in patients with cardiogenic shock or with ejection fraction (EF) lower than 30% on cardiac systo-diastolic function and plasma oxidants/antioxidants (glutathione, GSH; thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS).Methods:In 4 patients undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty, cardiovascular parameters were measured at T0 (before the beginning of levosimendan, 0.1mcg/Kg/min), T1(1 h after the achievement of the therapeutic dosage of levosimendan), T2 (at the end of levosimendan infusion), T3 (at 72 h after the end of levosimendan infusion), T4 (at the end of cardiogenic shock). The same time-course was followed for plasma GSH and TBARS measurements.Results:We found an improvement in cardiac output, cardiac index and systolic arterial blood pressure. EF increased from mean 25% to 45%. A reduction of central venous pressure and wedge pressure was also observed. Moreover, indices of diastolic function were improved by levosimendan administration (E/E’ from 14 to 6; E/A from >1 to <1) at early T2. It is to note that an improvement of GSH and TBARS was observed early after levosimendan administration (T1), as well (Figure 1).Conclusions:The results obtained have shown that levosimendan administration can regulate oxidant/antioxidant balance as an early effect in low cardiac output patients. The modulation of oxidative condition could be speculated to play a role in exerting the cardio-protection exerted by levosimendan in those patients.Fig. 1 (abstract P186).Effects of levosimendan on cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), glutathione (GSH) and malonyldialdeide (MDA, which is representative of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). * p<0.05 vs T0.

The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Continuous data is presented as mean (SEM). Categorical data is presented as % and analysed using a chi-squared test. A p value of <0.05 was used to determined significance. To allow for multiple comparison between data, a Bonferroni calculation was used to determine significance at a p value of <0.01. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for noradrenaline dose and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.Results:847 patients were admitted with septic shock. The majority (61%) were male, with a mean age of 62 (±0.6) and a 90-day mortality of 43%. Median noradrenaline dose had a fair prognostic ability on day 1 (AUC = 0.754 [0.714 – 0.794]) and good prognostic ability on day 2 (AUC = 0.844 [0.810 – 0.878]) (Figure 1).

Vasopressor use in the ED was associated with a lower mortality than no vasopressor use in the ED (38% vs 67%; RR 0.56 [0.36-0.88]; p = 0.035). There was no difference in the median MAP in ED between early or late vasopressor use (64.3 [1.2] mmHg vs 63.8 [2.7] mmHg; p = 0.56). A comparison between patients who survived and died is outlined in Table 1.Conclusions:Early administration of vasopressors and their use in the emergency department was associated with survival in septic shock.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of tuberculous cardiac tamponade, its clinical presentation and evolutive particularities in our cardiac care unitMethods:We conducted a cross-sectional prospective study from May 2016 to April 2019 including all the patients admitted in our unit for cardiac tamponade. We excluded all the traumatic or post-myocardial infarction forms.Results:Out of 83 patients, the tuberculous etiology was identified in 15 cases (18,1%), mean age was 34 years, 57,8% were men. 9 patients reported a TB contact in their environment, 5 had a medical history of pulmonary TB. After pericardiocentesis, the liquid was citrine yellow in 6 cases and hematic in 5 patients, no patient underwent surgical drainage in our serie. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in the expectorations in 4 cases and ADA was positive in 4 patients. HIV serology was negative in all our patients. A 6 months anti bacillary therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was initiated in all our patients with a good evolution in 7 cases, 2 deaths, 1 chronic constrictive pericarditis, 2 small pericardial effusion and 3 lost to follow-up.Conclusions:Althought cardiac tamponade is rarely caused by tuberculosis, this condition remains common in endemic countries such as Morocco and affect younger population, hence the importance of a better knowledge of its prevalence and and multidisciplinary management and more importantly the treatment of the underlying cause using Combined antibacillary medication that has shown satisfying results.P190 Point-of-care ultrasound teaching during anaesthesia and critical care residency: an Italian national surveyF Bonomi, S Mongodi, A Colombo, A Stella, S Pregnolato, G Salve, S Bonaiti, A Orlando, F MojoliFondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo - Università di Pavia, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Pavia, ItalyIntroduction:Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) became an invaluable tool in anaesthesia and critical care (ACC) [1]; appropriate training should integrate ACC residency programs [2].Methods:On-line surveys sent to 3 groups (ACC schools directors, residents and consultants), as approved by CPAR (Collegio Professori Anestesia Rianimazione), on teaching in vascular accesses-VA, lung ultrasound-LUS, transthoracic echocardiography-TTE, focused-assessment sonography for trauma-FAST, transcranial Doppler- TCD, regional anaesthesia-RA, diaphragm ultrasound-DUS.Results:In 270 survey days the form was filled by 568 residents (30/40 universities) 22 directors, 216 consultants (24/40 universities).

Nevertheless, there is little literature regarding the feasibility of ultrasonic evaluation of the CVC tip position. The main objective was to examine the accuracy of bedside ultrasound for confirmation of the CVC position and exclusion of pneumothorax compared with chest radiography (CXR).Methods:The study included a convenience sample of critically ill patients with supradiaphragmatic CVCs and a CXR for confirmation. US is used for direct confirmation of the guidewire in the Internal Jugular (IJV) or Subclavian (SCV) vein and visualizing the guidewire in the right atrium. To evaluate for pneumothorax, “sliding sign” of the pleura was noted on US of the anterior chest.Results:34 patients have been included, 35% of the catheters have been placed in the SCV and 65% in the IJV. It was possible to confirm the position of the CVC tip for 70.6% (23 correct, 1 incorrect CXR) of 34 cases by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Figure 1).

Our aims were to check the validity of the previous US measures in predicting HF diagnosis and prognosis.Methods:This review was based on the PRISMA guideline . The systematic search of the literature published from 1941 through 30 October 2019 explored the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Inclusion criteria: studies who investigated the reliability, the accuracy in predicting HF diagnosis and death or re-hospitalization of the IJV, IVC diameter, IVC collapsibility index (IVC-c = IVC max – IVC min / IVC max X 100) and Common Carotid US measures in adult (>18 yrs) with HF. Five researchers selected studies using inclusion criteria and then assessed their quality using the QUADAS-2 guidelines. The key words for literature search were: common carotid, internal jugular veins, inferior vena cava, ultrasonography and heart failure.Results:We collected 744 studies: 727 excluded with reasons, 18 studies were included for the final analysis: 4 on IJV, 13 on IVC, 1 on Carotid US. A IJV ratio < 4 predicts death and readmission : HR=2.7-10. A IVC ≥2 cm and IVC-c ≤15% showed an high accuracy in HF diagnosis and a moderate validity in predicting death and re-admission : AUC=0.63-0.78; HR=1.1-5.8 for IVC; AUC=0.63-0.74, HR=0.7-6.8 for IVC-c.

These studies may reveal structural and functional cardiac abnormalities that inform clinical care in the intensive care unit. And yet, little is known about the epidemiology of baseline echocardiography, specifically among patients admitted to intensive care with sepsis.Methods:We studied electronic health records of 1,076,925 adult patients from 12 hospitals at UPMC from 2013 to 2014. Eligible patients were those with Sepsis-3 at presentation who required intensive care during hospitalization. Demographics, comorbidities, illness acuity, and baseline echo parameters (within 1-year prior to incident sepsis hospitalization) were abstracted. An abnormal echocardiogram was defined as LVEF<50%, LV diastolic dimension >6 cm, moderate/severe RV dysfunction, or moderate/severe valvular stenosis/regurgitation. We compared characteristics of patients who did and did not receive an echo, those with normal and abnormal studies, and patients stratified by in-hospital mortality.Results:Among 43,086 adults with sepsis, 8,077 (18%) had baseline echocardiographic data within 1-year of admission, on average 131 (SD 103) days prior to presentation (Figure 1). Most septic patients had abnormal echo studies (N=5782, 72%). Of those who died (2,666 (6.2%)), 1,821(68.3%) had no echo data,192(7.2%) had normal and 653 (24.5%) had abnormal studies, compared to 40,420 (93.8%) survivors of which 7,232 (17.9%) had baseline echo, 2,298 (5.7%) had normal, and 5,779(14.3%) had abnormal echocardiograms.

Misplacement can be avoided with ultrasound guidance by using the right supraclavicular fossa view to confirm correct guidewire J-tip position in the lower part of the superior vena cava. However, retraction of the guidewire prior to the CVC insertion may dislocate the J-tip from its desired position, thereby increasing the risk of CVC misplacement. The aim of this study was to determine the minimal guidewire length needed to maintain correct guidewire J-tip position throughout an US-guided infraclavicular CVC placement in the right subclavian vein.Methods:100 adult intensive care patients with a computed tomography scan of the chest were retrospectively and consecutively included in the study. The distance from the most plausible distal puncture site of the right subclavian/axillary vein to the junction of the right and left brachiocephalic veins (= vessel length) was measured using multiplanar reconstructions. In addition, measurements of the equipment provided in commonly used 15-16 cm CVC kits were performed. The minimal guidewire length was calculated for each CVC kit.Results:The guidewires were up to 90 mm too short to maintain correct J-tip position throughout the CVC insertion procedure in seven of nine commercial CVC kits. Four of these are shown in Table 1.Conclusions:When US guidance is used to confirm a correct guidewire J-tip position, retraction of the guidewire prior to the CVC insertion must be avoided to ensure correct CVC-tip positioning. This study shows that most of the commonly used 15-16 cm CVC kits contain guidewires that are too short for CVC placement in the right subclavian vein.Table 1 (abstract P194).Minimal guidewire length = 105 mm (95th percentile of the vessel length) + 30 mm (to ensure that the guidewire J-tip passes the junction of the right and left brachiocephalic veins and the azygos arch into the lower part of the superior vena cava) + steel cannula length (the maximum length that can be inserted into the patient) + CVC full length + 10 mm (the part of the guidewire that must extend from the CVC before CVC-insertion)ManufacturerModelActual guide-wire length (mm)bCalculated minimal guidewire length (mm)cDiscrepancy (mm)Arrow, 2-lumenBlue FlexTip 16 cm59050684Bactiguard, 3-lumenBIP CVC 16 cm440513-73B Braun, 3-lumenCertofix 15 cm495528-33Meritmedical, 3-lumenCareflow 15 cm445535-90P195 The reliability of lung B-lines to assess fluid status in patients with long period of supine positionK Mnif1, O Doukali2, E Unluer3, R Ammar2, C Ben hamida2, M Bouaziz21University Hospital Habib Bouguiba Sfax, Intensive Care Unit, Sfax, Tunisia;2university hospital habib bouguiba"

Each patient’s fluid status was evaluated in admission and each 48 hours,using B-lines number assessment by lung ultrasound,measurement of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameters, and central venous pressure (CVP) analysis .Patients were stratified into three subgroups according to their B-lines number : mild ≤14, moderate (14–30) and severe (>30).Results:There were 530 separate assessments with mild,294 with moderate and 100 with severe B-lines occurrence. There was a significant positive correlation between the log B-lines number and both IVC diameter and CVP values.The correlation between log B-lines number and IVC diameters decreases but not significantly during hopitalization ( r in admission= 0.55, p=0.001 ; r in day 10 =0.43,p=0.035). Correlations between the log B-lines number and CVP during hospitalization yielded similar results (r in admission= 0.75, p=0.001 ; r in day10 = 0.63, p=0.0026).Conclusions:B-lines number assessment keeps a significant reliability to reflect hydration status in patients with long period of supine position.P196 Oblique approach for ultrasound-guided cannulation of femoral vein overlapped by arteryA Kothekar, J George, A Kulkarni, V PatilTata memorial center, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, IndiaIntroduction:Ultrasound-guided cannulation is usually done using either longitudinal or transverse approach. The oblique approach utilizes advantages of both these approaches allowing visualization of the entire course of needle including tip and lateral discrimination of artery from vein [1]. The reported incidence of the complete overlap of femoral vein by the femoral artery is 8-10 percent [2,3]. We describe the use of the oblique approach for successful cannulation of such a femoral vein which is not possible by usual approaches (Figure 1).Methods:Case 1: A 36-year male, a diagnosed case of carcinoma right buccal mucosa was operated for wide local excision, right-sided neck dissection, and reconstruction. In immediate perioperative period, he sustained cardiac arrest due to exsanguinating bleeding from maxillary artery and pterygoid plexus needing external carotid artery ligation.

Endothelial cell dysfunction (ED) is the main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD) and peripheral occlusive disease (POD). These diseases significantly increase the risk for perioperative complications. Therefore, identifying patients with ED is important and should influence our prospective perioperative strategy. However, sensitive tools to diagnose ED are still missing and do not belong to our standard of care. Aim of this study was the validation of a new non-invasive method to detect ED and a correlation with a set of established an new endothelial biomarkers.Methods:The cohort includes 20 preoperative patients without anamnestic relevant cardiovascular disease and 20 patients with known peripheral occlusive disease (POD). We used non-invasive EndoPAT® Technology from ITAMAR-Medical to measure ED by changes in vascular tone before and after occlusion of the brachial artery and calculate a reactive hyperemia index (RHI). In addition, we measured established markers and alternative biomarkers potentially indicate vascular diseases such as substrates and products from the NO-metabolism L-Arginin, asymmetric/symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA/SDMA), von-Willebrand factor (vWF) and Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).Results:RHI was able to identify patients with POD. RHI was significant lower in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of POD (P<0.05).

However, the reliability of PICCs of larger size is still unknown.Methods:Prospective method-comparison study conducted in a medical-surgical ICU of a teaching hospital. We compared TPTD measurements via single-lumen 5Fr or triple-lumen 6Fr polyurethane power injectable PICCs vs. triple-lumen 7Fr CICC using a TPTD-calibrated Pulse Contour hemodynamic monitoring system (VolumeView/EV1000TMEdwards ©).Results:Out of 160 manual measurements in 15 patients, we did not found any difference in CI between single-lumen 5Fr PICC compared to CICC (3.2±1.04 vs. 3.2±1.06 L/min/m2, p=0.824; percentage of error 14.7%); we also found no differences GEDVI, EVLWI, SVI and CVP. CI was slightly higher when using triple-lumen 6Fr PICC than when using CICC (3.3±0.8 vs. 3.0±0.7 L/min/m2, p=0.107, percentage of error 19.0%), although this difference did not reach the statistical significance. We found instead a difference in GEDVI (685±133 vs. 632±102 mL/m2, p=0.05; percentage of error 19.5%).Conclusions:Single-lumen 5Fr PICCs are surely accurate for TPTD use, whereas triple-lumen 6Fr PICCs lead to a slight overestimation (ClinicalTrial.govNCT03834675).References:1.

We assume a complex adaptation of the cardiovascular system that can compensate for the loss of vascular resistance in the absence of vasopressors without affecting the cardiac index.P201 Establishing a focused critical care echocardiography programme in a developing world intensive care unitD Hall1, J Harrington1, M Murali2, TY Wang2, N Shamambo21Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;2University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, ZambiaIntroduction:Achieving effective critical care in low- and middle-income countries is a global health goal [1], which includes the provision of effective point of care ultrasound [2]. We sought to establish Zambia’s first focused critical care echocardiography training programme in a 16-bedded ICU at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka.Methods:The programme was accredited by the UK Intensive Care Society FICE programme, with teaching adapted for local disease patterns such as tuberculous pericardial effusions. Parasternal, apical and subcostal windows were used to assess ventricular dysfunction, hypovolaemia, pleural effusion, alveolar interstitial syndrome and pneumothorax. Zambian doctors working with critically ill patients received an intensive one-day course, followed by mentored scanning at the bedside. Teaching was delivered by visiting fellows from the UK who are accredited in echocardiography and experienced ultrasound educators.Results:26 Zambian doctors who work with critically ill patients (16 anaesthetists, 8 paediatricians, 2 physicians) were enrolled.

Primary endpoint: hospital mortality of patients with mean values of CI, SVI and HR within and without normal range. Statistics: chi-square test.

Mortality was higher for patients with mean CI outside compared to mean CI inside normal range. (59.1% vs. 30.3%, p=0.034). Mortality was 54.6%, 41,7% and 11.1% for patients with mean SVI below, within and above normal range. Mortality was not different for patients with abnormal mean SVI (41.9% vs. 41.7%, p=0.984). Mortality was 0%, 22.7%, 56.3% for patients with mean HR below, within and above normal range. Mortality was higher for patients with abnormal mean HR (54.6% vs. 22.7%, p=0.019).Conclusions:Patients with abnormal mean CI or HR suffer from increased hospital mortality.

To overcome the problem, our team has developed a concept of pressure detecting syringe that can indicate the artery puncture [1]. Based on previous research, different springs, the actuator of the design, have been evaluated to optimize the proposed device and reduce the risk of CVC procedure.Methods:Tested devices - The inner-spring is set between the pressure indicator and plunger (Fig. 1A). Three springs are tested.Test condition-Blood samples were simulated by glucose solution with absolute viscosities of 2 and 6 mPa-s. Different blood pressures were applied to simulate the artery and vein (Fig. 1B). The response time (RT) is defined as the time required to show the indicating signal (IS) which is the movement of the piston from the position in Fig. 1B: A2-1 to A2-2.Results:The RT is strongly influenced by spring (Fig. 1B) but every design can show the IS when pressure is higher than 50 mmHg, the assumed minimum artery pressure. The RT of S1, the strongest spring design, is about 10s in the 50mmHg-pressure and high viscosity condition. During our tests we found the user can realize the IS before the position be fully changed from Fig. IB: A2-1 to A2-2. Thus, we believe the 10s RT, the worst case, is still acceptable. We also found the weak spring force may lead to difficulty to empty the syringe because the spring must to overcome the blood pressure and the friction between the piston and barrel. As a result, it was difficult for S3 to absolutely empty the syringe even if the blood pressure is only 30 mmHg. The spring will be compressed as Fig. 1B: A2-2 and fail to push the piston when pushing the plunger forwardly, which is not acceptable in clinical use.Conclusions:The results indicate the feasibility of using the device to facilitate CVC and we believe the S1 or S2 are more suitable for the future application.References:1.

By featurizing interactions between VS we can train powerful hemorrhage detectors robust to unknown bleed rates.Methods:Waveforms (arterial, central venous, pulmonary arterial pressures; peripheral and mixed venous oxygen saturation; photoplethysmograph; ECG) of healthy pigs were monitored 20 min prior and during a controlled hemorrhage at 20 mL/min (N=38) and 5 mL/min (N=13). Two sets of VS features were extracted: statistical features [1] and maximal pairwise cross correlations between pairs of VS within a 5s lag over various time window sizes (30s, 60s, 180s, 300s); and normalized with pre-bleed data of each given animal. For each feature set, a tree-based (ERT) model [2] was trained and tested in a one-animal-out setting to mitigate overfitting on the 20 mL/min cohort, and another trained on the 5 mL/min and tested on the 20 mL/min cohort. We evaluated models with Activity Monitoring Operating Characteristics curves [3] that measure false alert rate as a function of time to detect bleeding.Results:Models using cross-correlations show no significant deterioration of performance when applied to detect bleeding at different rates than trained for, while standard models require 64s longer on average to detect hemorrhage at 1% false alert rate in the previously unknown setting (Figure 1).Conclusions:Correlations between VS data encode physiologic responses to hemorrhage in a way independent of the actual bleed rates. This enables training effective hemorrhage detectors using only limited experimental data, and using them in practice to detect bleeding that occurs at rates other than used in training.Acknowledgement: Work was partially supported by DARPA FA8750-17-2-013 and NIH NIGMS 1R01GM117622References:1.

The purpose of this project was to develop an application software for guiding hemodynamic decision support in critically ill patients.Methods:We validated a dataset of 634 data lines containing hemodynamic variables and treatment options. We selected nine hemodynamic variables as inputs. Furthermore, data were collected regarding underlying conditions: heart failure, septic shock, renal failure or respiratory failure or a combination. We applied DataStories regression on the dataset (Turnhout, Belgium, www.datastories.com). Six different interventions were analyzed as KPI: administration or removal of fluids, increasing or decreasing inotropes and increasing or decreasing vasopressors. Finally, we elaborated and challenged 63537 predictive models to generate a decision algorithm to predict each KPI. We first looked at how each hemodynamic parameter impacts the prediction of each KPI individually and performed a standard correlation analysis as well as a more involved analysis of the mutual information content between each KPI and all other hemodynamic parameters individually. Confusion matrix and variable importance was obtained for each KPI.Results:The baseline hemodynamic parameters were: GEDVi 738±218 ml/m2, EVWLi 11.2±5.5 ml/kg PBW, SVV 14.8±8 %, MBP 77.8±16.5 mmHg, HR 94.2±23.5 bpm, CI 3.3±1.2 L/min.m2. The results of the regression analysis identified the different variables of importance for each of the different interventions (Fig 1A). Based on these results the hemodynamic variables (HR, MBP, GEDVI, ELWI, CI, SVV) were used to develop the final HemoGuide prediction model (Fig 1B).Conclusions:The HemoGuide app can be used to advise physicians with respect to basic therapeutic decisions at the bedside or as an educational tool for students. With the collection of new data, the accuracy of the system may grow over time.

However, it has been reported to have an intra-observer variance, partly because of manual compression and naked-eye measurement of the nailbed color change. We hypothesized that a feedback function on a CRT measurement device would lead to an accurate compression.Methods:We developed a novel portable CRT measurement device with an OLED display that feedbacks weather the strength of the nailbed compression is enough and counts the time. We settled the target strength and time as 5N and 5seconds according to the study we reported before [1]. 20 examiners measured CRT with and without the feedback function. The pressing strength and time during the measurement were evaluated.Results:There was a significant difference among the pressing strength and time between the CRT measurement using the device with and without the feedback function (strength: P<0.001; time: P<0.001). Furthermore, intra-examiner variance was significantly reduced with the feedback function (strength: P<0.001; time: P<0.001). In all measurements without the feedback function, 41% was outside the optimal strength while the measurements with the feedback function 100% achieved the targeted range. Without the feedback function, 12% could not reach the optimal time, while 100% with the feedback function did. In total, 49% of the measurements could not achieve the optimal pressing strength and time.Conclusions:The feedback function for CRT measurements, guiding examiners to an optimal pressing strength and time, fulfilled the required measurement conditions and reduced intra-examiner variance. Our novel portable device would assist an accurate CRT measurement regardless of personal work experience.References:1. Kawaguchi R et al.

However, most of methods used in the clinical practice investigate the effects of fluids on the cardiac function, instead of investigating those on the determinants of venous return. Besides volume of fluids, the determinants of fluid loading are the blood volume distribution and the availability of vascular bed. In this study we aimed to test non-invasively the effects of fluids administration on the venular compartment in the skeletal muscle. In addition to the mean systemic filling pressure (msfp), we calculated changes in the stressed and unstressed volumes (Vs, Vu) and the venular bed availability.Methods:We enrolled 10 critically ill patients in our Intensive Care Unit.

Post-induction hypotension (PIH) is caused by the depressant cardiovascular effect of anesthetic drugs and could be amplified by hypovolemia. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of two echocardiographic fluid responsiveness markers to predict PIH: the inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVC-CI) and the velocity time integral change (ΔVTI) after passive leg raising.Methods:Sixty patients > 50 years of age and scheduled for elective surgery were included. IVC-CI and ΔVTI were measured before GA induction. Anesthesia protocol, fluid infusion and vasopressor administration were standardized in all patients. PIH was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg or a relative decline from pre-induction value of at least 30% within 12 minutes of GA induction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used. The optimal cut-off was selected to maximize the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity − 1).Results:The measurement of IVC-CI and/or ΔVTI were unsuccessful in seven patients (11.6%). PIH occurred in 32 patients (incidence 53 %). The areas under the ROC curves (Figure 1) were 0.84 [95% CI: 0.72 – 0.96; p<0.0001] for ΔVTI and 0.67 [95% CI: 0.52 – 0.83; p=0.043] for IVC-CI. The optimal cut-off values were 18% for ΔVTI (sensitivity 75%, specificity 91%) and 25% for IVC-CI (sensitivity 75 %, specificity 45%).Conclusions:The ΔVTI after passive leg raising was able to predict PIH and performed better than IVC-CI. The use of this marker could help individualize strategies to prevent PIH (pre-induction fluid loading, vasopressors, anesthetic technique and close hemodynamic monitoring).References:1.

Statistics: SPSS 26.Results:n=30; 15 female, 15 male; mechanical ventilation 240/240 (100%); vasopressors 156/240 (65%). PVI could not be derived in 1 of 240 measurements (0.4%). PVI (14.8±9.3%) was higher (p<0.001) than PPV (11.1±9.0%) and SVV (12.6±7.3%). Classifications within the categories ‘<9%’, ‘9-13%’ and ‘>13%’ agreed in 117 of 239 (49%) measurements for PVI vs. PPV (Kendall-tau r=0.435; p<0.001) and in 131 of 239 (55%) cases for PVI vs. SVV (r=0.431; p <0.001). PVI-values of 14% and 17% had the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity (ROC-analysis; Youden-Index) to predict the established PPV-cut-offs of 9% and 13%. PVI in the corrected categories ‘<14%’, ‘14-17%’ and ‘>17%’ substantially better agreed (166/239; 65%; r=0.500) with the PPV-categories ‘<9%’, ‘9-13%’ and ‘>13%’ compared to the uncorrected PVI categories ‘<9%’, ‘9-13%’ and ‘>13%’ (agreement 117 of 239 measurements (49%); p<0.001 vs. 166 of 239; chi-square-test).Conclusions:PVI was significantly higher than PPV and SVV. Only 49% and 55% of PPV- and SVV-values are classified in the same categories ‘<9%’, ‘9-13%’ and ‘>13%’ as PVI. Adjusting the PVI thresholds to 14% and 17% instead of 9 and 13% significantly improves the agreement PVI- with PPV-categories.P214 Preload responsiveness can be detected by mini and micro fluid challenges monitored with pulse contour analysisN De Vita, F Gavelli, JL Teboul, A Beurton, A Pavot, R Shi, X MonnetHôpital de Bicêtre, Service de médecine intensive-réanimation, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, FranceIntroduction:Preload responsiveness might be detected by the changes of cardiac index (ΔCImini) induced by a “mini-fluid challenge” (mini-FC) of 100 mL or even by the"

However, the smaller the fluid challenge, the larger the “grey zone” of diagnostic uncertainty. We tested whether (1) micro- and mini-FC monitored by calibrated pulse contour analysis detect preload responsiveness and (2) adding 50 mL when the result of a micro-FC is within the grey zone improves diagnostic accuracy.Methods:In 30 patients with circulatory failure, we infused 50 mL saline over 30s followed by 50 mL over 60s. We measured ΔCImicro and ΔCImini by the pulse contour analysis (PiCCO2). Preload responsiveness was defined by an increase in CI (ΔCIPLR) during a passive leg raising test ≥10%. Diagnostic uncertainty was described by calculating the grey zone after bootstrapping.Results:ΔCImicro were larger in responders than in non-responders (5.1[2.5-9.9]%vs. 0[0-0.7]%, respectively; p<0.0001). It was also the case for ΔCImini (9.7[7.0-12.6]%vs. 0.8[0-2.9]%, respectively; p<0.0001). We found a correlation between ΔCImicro and ΔCImini on the one side and ΔCIPLR on the other side (r=0.71 and r=0.82, respectively; p<0.0001 for both). For the micro-FC, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.975±0.03 (threshold 1%), while it was 0.955±0.03 for the mini-FC (threshold 4%). For the micro-FC, the grey zone ranged from 0.82% to 3.47% and included 9 (30%) patients. For the mini-FC, it ranged from 2.8% to 6.8% and included 9 (33)% patients, among which 6 were already in the grey zone of the micro-FC.Conclusions:When evaluated by pulse contour analysis, micro- and mini-FC reliably detect preload responsiveness but with a large diagnostic uncertainty. It seems that adding 50mL more fluid to a micro-FC when its result is within the grey zone does not improve the diagnostic accuracy.

PLR results were not reliable in 34% of cases, due to either compression stockings (14%) or intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) (11%). In 7% of cases, no cardiac output (CO) monitoring could be obtained. Among MV patients, PPV was not interpretable in 83% of cases mainly due to spontaneous breathing activity (24%) and low tidal volume ventilation (21%). The remaining non-interpretable cases (38%) had multiple concurrent limitations. EEXPO could not be interpreted in 20% of MV patients, because either a 15-s respiratory hold could not be maintained (62%), or CO could not be monitored (38%). PLR and EEXPO were both valid in 33% of patients, while all the 3 tests were valid in 6% of patients (50% and 9% of MV patients, respectively).Conclusions:In conclusion, PLR interpretation is not reliable in 34% of shock patients.

We tested whether it can also track the small and short-time ∆CI induced by the end-expiratory occlusion (EEXPO) test, and whether shortening the time over which it averages cardiac output (24 s in the commercial version) improves the detection.Methods:In 42 mechanically ventilated patients, during a 15-sec EEXPO, we measured ∆CI (in absolute value and in percentage) through calibrated pulse contour analysis (CIpulse, PiCCO2 device) and Starling-SV. For the latter, we considered both CIStarling-24provided by the commercial version and CIStarling-8obtained by averaging the raw data over 8 s. We calculated the correlation between ∆CIpulseand both ∆CIStarling-24and ∆CIStarling-8, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to detect preload responsiveness, defined by a PLR test.Results:When considering absolute values, the correlation coefficientrbetween ∆CIpulseand ∆CIStarling-24was 0.362 (p=0.02), which was lower than the one between ∆CIpulseand ∆CIStarling-8(rrcomparison).

The perfusion index (PI) is the ratio between the pulsatile and the non-pulsatile portions of the plethysmography signal. It is in part determined by stroke volume and can detect a positive passive leg raising (PLR) test. We hypothesized that the changes in PI could detect a positive EEXPO test and thus preload responsiveness in a totally non-invasive way.Methods:In critically ill patients, we measured PI (Radical 7, Masimo) and CI (PiCCO2, Pulsion Medical Systems) before and during a PLR test, a 15-sec EEXPO and EIXPO tests and, if decided, before and after volume expansion (VE) (500-mL saline).Results:We included 31 patients. In 19 patients with a positive PLR test (increase in CI ≥ 10%), CI and PI increased during PLR by 17±7% and 49±23%, respectively, and during EEXPO test by 6±2% and 11±8%, respectively. During EIXPO, CI and PI decreased significantly by 12±4% and 11±9% respectively. In the 12 patients with a negative PLR test, PI did not significantly change during PLR, EEXPO and EIXPO tests. Only four patients received VE, causing an increase of CI and PI by 15±3% and 32±47% respectively. The correlation between the PI and CI PLR-induced changes was significant (r = 0.84, p<0.001). During the EEXPO test, if PI increased by >5%, a positive response of CI (≥5%) to the EEXPO test was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 87 (60-98)% and a specificity of 94 (70-100)% (AUROC curve: 0.92 (0.77-0.99), p<0.0001). During the combination of EEXPO and EIXPO tests, if PI increased by >9%, a positive response of CI to the EEXPO test was diagnosed with the same sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions:An increase in PI >5% during an EEXPO test accurately detects a positive response of CI to the EEXPO test.P218 Does the infusion speed impact the hemodyamic effect of a fluid bolus in septic shock patients?

A pharmacodynamic studyAP Pavot, F Gavelli, JL Teboul, S RUI, D Vimpere, I Adda, L Guerin, X MonnetBicetre Hospital, Medical Intensive Care, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, FranceIntroduction:Fluids are among the most prescribed drug in intensive care, particularly among patient with circulatory failure. Yet, very little is known about their pharmacodynamic properties and this topic has been left largely unexplored. There is a lack of strong scientific evidence in current guidelines for fluid administration in shock. Several factors may impact the hemodynamic efficacy of fluids among which the infusion rate. The aim of this study was to study the influence of fluids administration rate on their pharmacodynamics in particular by studying mean systemic pressure (Pms).Methods:We conducted a prospective observational study in 17 patients with circulatory failure to compare two volume expansion strategies. When a patient required a fluid bolus, 500 mL of normal saline were administered and several hemodynamic parameters were recorded continuously: cardiac output (CO), arterial pressure (AP), mean systemic pressure (Pms). Infusion rate was let to the discretion of the attending physician and a “slow” and a “fast” group were determined based on the median of the infusion time. Fluids effect was measured by the area under the curve (AUC), maximal effect (Emax) and time to maximal effect (tmax) for each hemodynamic variable.Results:PmsAUC was higher in the “fast” group compared to the “slow” group (p=0.043). We observed a shorter tmaxand a higher Emaxfor Pmsin the “fast” group compared to the “slow” group (p=0.039 and 0.02 respectively). Regarding CO, tmaxwas also shorter in the “fast” group (p=0.041). AUC and Emaxwere similar between the two groups. Fluid effect dissipated within 60 minutes following the end of fluid infusion for every patient in both groups. The decreasing slope from maximal effect was comparable in the groups, for Pmsand CO alike.Conclusions:The effect of a 500 mL fluid bolus in septic shock patients vanished within one hour. A faster infusion rate increased maximal effect and shortened the delay to reach it.

We then excluded patients who did not have albumin data available for the first 7 days, leaving us with 758 patients. 506 patients (66.8%) had sepsis, and of these patients 116 had died by day 28. Of the 252 non-septic patients (33.2%), 40 patients had died by day 28. Albumin levels were collected for 7 days from admission to critical care, in addition to other demographic and biochemical data. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis.Results:Septic patients had lower serum albumin than non-septic patients throughout the 7 day period (p<0.001). We observed a decrease in albumin by day 2 in all groups, with levels increasing over the subsequent days. There was no difference in daily serum albumin between non-septic patients who survived or died.Conclusions:This is the first study, to our knowledge, to compare albumin trends in septic and non-septic critically ill patients over 7 days.

Early albumin resuscitation is avoided fearing a paradoxical fluid escape into the interstitium. On the other hand, administration of crystalloids in massive amounts causes tissue edema and fluid extravasation, which deteriorates tissue perfusion by increasing oxygen diffusion distance. Albumin administration could reduce the amount required to maintain hemodynamic stability in this population. We investigated whether albumin improves tissue perfusion and microcirculation by reducing tissue edema.Methods:This is an observational study conducted in the Burn Unit of Maasstad Hospital, Rotterdam. Patients with burns higher than 15% of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) were included in the study. Sublingual microcirculation was measured at admission (T0), 4(T4), and 12(T12) hours after burn injury. Total Vessel Density (TVD) and Functional Capillary Density (FCD) were analyzed. Fluid Management was calculated according to the modified Parkland formula. Albumin (20%) infusion was started 12 hours after the burn insult.Results:A total of nine patients were recruited between January and December 2019. Patients were included in the study after 5.7±2.3 hours of the insult with a mean TBSA of 36±22%. The amount of crystalloid infusion was 2718±3348 ml and 8501±5230 ml at T0 and T12,respectively. Within the first 12h (T12) 502±386 ml albumin was given. TVD decreased from 23.6±2.2 at T0 to 20±1.3 at T4 (p<0.05) (Figure 1). It increased to 22.7±3.2 at T12 (ns vs T0).

Albumin infusion has been shown to improve the outcome of SBP. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of albumin infusion on hospital length of stay (LOS) for cirrhotic patients with SBP.Methods:We utilized a nationwide Electronic Health Record data set (Cerner Health Facts®) to extract real-world data on adult patients (≥18 years old) with cirrhosis and SBP who received antibiotics and admitted between January 1, 2009, and April 30, 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9/10) codes were used to identify cirrhosis and SBP. We used laboratory data for calculation of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD-Na) score and vital signs data for calculation of the quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score at baseline for each encounter. A generalized linear model was used to assess the relationship between albumin infusion and hospital LOS.Results:There were 2,131 encounters that identified patients with SBP and cirrhosis, of which 1,661 survived hospitalization. Albumin was infused within 24 hours of admission ('early albumin') in 43% (n=718), after 24 hours in 31% ('late albumin', n=517), and not administered in 26% ('no albumin', n=426). MELD-Na was higher at presentation in early albumin cases versus late- or no-albumin cases (mean 24.0 and 19.5). Unadjusted LOS was lower in patients receiving early albumin (8.7 days versus 10.4 days). Risk-adjusted analysis demonstrated that early albumin led to a 17.5% reduction in LOS (95% CI 12.6%-22.2%, p = <0.0001).Conclusions:In these real-world data, albumin infusion within 24 hours of admission in patients with cirrhosis and SBP was associated with a shorter hospital stay despite more severe illness.

Albumin was infused within 24 hours of admission ('early albumin') in 15%, after 24 hours ('late albumin') in 20%, and not administered in 65%. Both CCI and APS were higher, at presentation, in early albumin cases than late- or no-albumin cases (mean: 7.49 and 7.17, and 51.50 and 43.23, respectively). Unadjusted LOS was slightly lower in patients receiving early albumin (11.81 days versus 11.84 days). A risk-adjusted analysis demonstrated that early albumin was associated with 4.92% shorter LOS (95% CI 0.43%-9.22%, p = 0.0322).Conclusions:Albumin infusion within 24 hours of admission was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay. Early albumin infusion may lead to better outcomes and reduced costs in patients with septic shock. Further research is being conducted to assess other potential benefits of early albumin administration in this patient population.P226 Minute-to-minute urine flow rate and urine flow rate variability fluctuations during septic event in critically ill patientsE BrotfainBen Gurion University of the Negev, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Beer Sheva, IsraelIntroduction:Every new septic event follows by hemodynamic instability may lead sequentially to decreased organ perfusion, multiple organ failure. Acute renal failure is recognized clinical feature during sepsis (up to 40-50% in all cases). Furthermore, urine output close monitoring is a cornerstone diagnostic clinical tool in each septic critically ill patient. In present study, we analyzed the dynamic minute-to-minute changes in the urine flow rate (UFR) and also the changes in its minute-to-minute variability (UFRV) during new septic event in critically ill patients.Methods:Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the of 50 critically ill patients who were admitted to the ICU and developed new septic event (followed by fever and leukocytosis) and analyzed. A Foley catheter was inserted into the urinary bladder of each study patient. The catheter was then connected to electronic urinometer, a collecting and measurement system which employs an optical drop detector to measure urine flow. The urine flow rate variability (UFRV) is defined and calculated as the change in UFR from minute to minute.Results:UFR and UFRV both decreased significantly immediate after new septic episode until"

We aimed to explore the role of urinary output on incidence and mortality of AKI developed during ICU admission.Methods:The study population consists of all patients admitted between 2007 and 2018 to one of the Dutch ICUs included in the NICE database with an ICU length of stay of at least 48 hours, having daily measurement of creatinine and UO. Only patients without renal replacement therapy that have a serum creatinine lower than 1.1 mg/dl (97.5 μmol/L) or a UO above 0.5 ml/kg/h on the day of the index ICU admission were considered at risk for AKI. Patients were followed during their ICU stay and classified according to the highest KDIGO criteria reached based on creatinine alone (model 1) and creatinine plus UO (model 2) using ICU admission serum creatinine as baseline.

IR induces renal tubular injury triggered by hypoxia and hyperoxia, mediated by oxidative stress and inflammation. Furosemide inhibits Na+-K+-2Cl-cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the renal medulla to decrease Na+reabsorption, reducing oxygen consumption. We investigated if furosemide could improve renal oxygenation, function and damage by reducing O2consumption and oxidative stress after IR.Methods:24 Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 groups, with 6 in each group; Sham-operated Control (C), Control + Furosemide (C+F), IR and IR+F. After anaesthesia (BL), 45 min supra-aortic occlusion was applied to IR and IR+F groups followed by 15 min (T1) and 2 hours of reperfusion (T2). Furosemide 50μg/kg/h infusion was simultaneously administered to C+F and IR+F after ischemia. Systemic hemodynamic, renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), renal oxygen delivery (DO2ren), renal oxygen consumption (VO2ren), creatinine clearance (Ccr), sodium handling, urine output (UO), cortical (CμO2) and medullar (MμO2) microvascular oxygenation were measured.Results:RBF was reduced in IR (2.1±1) and IR+F (2.3±1) at T1 (p<0.05) but it was further reduced in IR+F (1.9±1) (p<0.05) at T2 compared to C and C+F. RVR was increased in IR (5338±2860) and IR+F (5123±2517) at T1 compared to C. RVR was normalized in IR (2198±879) but not in IR+F (4232±2636) at T2 compared to C (p<0.05).

We aimed to study the relationship between hypoxemia and the occurrence of ARF.Methods:Retrospective cohort study including patients with hypoxemia whatever its etiology between January 2016 and August 2019. Patients with chronic renal failure were excluded. ARF was defined and ranked according to the KDIGO criteria 2012. Arterial blood gas, urea, creatinine and clearance were reordered on the first, third and seventh days of evolution.Results:50 patients were included and 2 groups were obtained: group of hypoxemic patients with ARF (ARF+, n=30): versus group of hypoxemic patients without ARF (ARF-, n= 20). The incidence of hypoxemie-induced ARF was therefore 60%. Clinical characteristics were comparable in both groups with a mean age of 47 ± 16 and a sex ratio of 1.77. The comparative study showed in ARF+ group: a lower pH (7.20 [7.8-7.33] vs.7.34 [7.27-7.41], p = 0.003) and a higher C reactive protein (CRP) in the same group (201 [129.75-325.75] vs. 117.5 [29.5-225.25], p = 0.023). The most significant correlation was showed with MDRD clearance at day 3 and P/F ratio at day 1 (Rho = 0.338, p = 0.038).

We used 1:4 Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Propensity Score Stratification (PSS) and Propensity Score Weighting (PSW) based on the probability to be exposed to metformin using 55 covariates. For PSM an exact match for insulin, amputation, cardiovascular diseases, retinopathy, Charlson Index, eGFR, HbA1C, and APACHE III, were used. Sepsis was defined using sepsis 3 criteria, and AKI as KDIGO stage 2 or 3.Results:From 164,910 patients, we found 673 diabetic adults exposed to metformin during hospitalization and 14,174 who were not. PSM included 523 treated vs 1,680 no treated patients and resulted in an OR of 0.54 (95%CI 0.41-0.71, p<0.001) for 90-day mortality favoring metformin exposure (Figure 1).

Hospital “Sveti Duh”, Intensive Care Unit, Zagreb, CroatiaIntroduction:This study aims to show that contrast procedures do not significantly increase the risk of renal injury and should not be deferred. Traditionally CIAKI is the most important cause of in-hospital renal failure after nephrotoxic drugs and shock. Problem is also the non-uniform definition of CIAKI proposed by three different initiatives (AKIN, ESUR and KDIGO). AKIN, being the most rigorous, defines CIAKI as an increase in serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL or >50% of baseline within 48hours.Methods:A retrospective observational single-centre cohort study analyzed 82 patients who underwent a contrast procedure with Iomeron 350. The first group underwent a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), and the second a coronary angiography with PCI. No patient was previously prepared (RAAS blockade removal, crystalloid administration etc). We studied demographics, history of CKD and comorbidities and their impact on the CIAKI by the AKIN criteria.Results:A total of 82 patients were divided into two groups (CTPA and PCI). CTPA group (20M, 21F) all had acute PE and the PCI group (28M, 13F) were treated for ACS. The mean age was 69 and 65 years respectively. CKD was more prevalent in the PCI group (8pt vs. 3pt) possibly explained by the more advanced atherosclerotic disease. Advanced CHD (NYHA III/IV) was found in 3pt (PCI) vs. 2pt (CTPA) while diabetes and shock were equally distributed (11pt and 5pt) in both groups. The mean amount of contrast was significantly higher in the PCI group (242.3mL vs. 60mL). The mean creatinine/eGFR measured before and after contrast in the CTPA group was 87.3/71.7 vs. 75.1/83 and in the PCI group 91.4/75.9 vs. 105.3/76.1.

Baseline patient creatinine value was collected and GFR was estimated using the MDRD, CKD-EPI and CG formulas. CG formula was further modified by replacing the BM with FFM derived from the bioelectrical impedance analysis. Postoperative AKI was defined by KDIGO creatinine change definitions. Accuracy of the eGFR values to predict the AKI was calculated with ROC-AUC analysis. All the calculations were performed in different categories of BMI.Results:476 patients were included in the study, 67.2% of them were men, mean age was 64.5±10.8y. Median Euroscore II was 1.69 [IQR: 1.05-2.49]; 66.4% patients underwent CABG. Total of 138 patients were diagnosed with postoperative AKI (28.99%). The mean measured eGFR varied according to equation: MDRD 74.74±0.9, CKD-EPI 76.79±0.9, CG 86.42±1.4, mCG 61.19±1.0. When comparing AUC in different categories of BMI, the mCG appeared to be the only statistically accurate formula in patients with BMI 30–34.9 (Figure 1).Conclusions:The eGFR is a poor predictor of AKI in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The FFM modified Cauckraft-Gault formula yield more accuracy in this specific group.Fig. 1 (abstract P236).When comparing AUC in different categories of BMI, the mCG appeared to be the only statistically accurate formula in patients with BMI 30–34.9P237 RetroAKI: a ten-year retrospective study of acute kidney injury in intensive and progressive care unitsA Gardon, VZ Zorio, MB Bodinier, MD Dutour, CM Monard, JC Crozon, GM Marcotte, JT Textoris, TR RimmeléEdouard Herriot Hospital, Hospices Civiles de Lyon, Department of Intensive Care, 5 Place d´Arsonval, FranceIntroduction:Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent condition in intensive care units (ICU) and progressive care units (PCU), affecting 15% to 70% of the patients, depending on the studied population and AKI definition.

Data used to classify the patients were the urine output over a six-hour period, serum creatinine and the need for RRT, according to KDIGO classificationResults:18,882 hospital stays were analyzed. Median ICU/PCU length of stay was 3 days [IQR: 1.5-6.6]. Among ICU patients, 74% had at least one AKI episode graded 1, 2 or 3 and 49% had at least one severe episode (stage 2 or 3). Among PCU patients, 44% had at least one episode of AKI and 20% a severe episode of AKI. Patients had an average of 1.9 episodes of AKI per stay. Table 1 represents the incidence of maximal AKI stage during one stay. We found that urine output was the more frequent criteria to make diagnosis of AKI stage 1 or 2 whereas RRT was more frequent for AKI stage 3.Conclusions:This retrospective study reports a more important AKI incidence in our ICU/PCU than in previous studies. The difference could be explained by the difficulty to collect urine output from conventional database. Serum creatinine and the use of RRT are often the only two criteria used to define and classify AKI.

We observed 2-3 times higher mortality in AKI patients with infection, and a stepwise increase of mortality with increasing AKI stages.

Several studies suggest the usefulness of NC in selected populations. However, the value of early routine measurement of NC is unclear.Methods:Therefore, we compared the prediction of a combined endpoint (CEP: death <60 days and/or requirement of renal replacement therapy RRT) by NC within 12h of ICU admission (NC1) and 24h later (NC2) with admission values of serum-creatinine, BUN, cystatin C, urinary NGAL, APACHE II and SOFA (ROC-analysis). As a secondary endpoint we investigated the additional value of pathological measurements of NC1≥0.3 and/or NC2≥0.3 (NC+) in addition to AKI defined as KDIGO≥1 in a combined model (Kaplan-Meier-analysis).

Furthermore, cystatin C (AUC=0.715; p<0.001), BUN (AUC=0.700; p=0.001), creatinine (AUC=0.700; p=0.001), NC1 (AUC=0.659; p=0.008) and APACHE-II (AUC=0.651; p=0.012) significantly predicted the combined endpoint.

However, their predictive capacity was not superior to cystatin C on admission. 2) By contrast, combination of NC with AKI according to KDIGO improves prediction of the combined endpoint vs. KDIGO alone.P240 The role of renal artero-venous coupling (RAVC) in the prediction of acute kidney injury in post-surgical critical care patientsL Tecchi1, S Maiorano1, C Brusasco2, F Forfori1, F Corradi31Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana, Department of Surgical, Medical and Molecular Pathology and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy., Pisa, Italy;2Ospedali Galliera.

Doppler were measured within 6hours following admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria (KDIGO). The new Doppler index RAVC was calculated as follows: (Cardiac Cycle Time – venous flow time)/Arterial Total Ejection time – Pre-Ejection Time).Results:Mean RAVC was 4.7±3.4 in patients with AKI 0–2 and 0.8±2.3 in patients with AKI 3 (P<0.001). Mean STI was 0.82±0.60 in patients with AKI 0–2 and 0.50±0.27 in patients with AKI 3 (P<0.001). Median VII was 0.81±0.19 in patients with AKI 0–2 and 0.43±0.24 in patients with AKI 3 (P<0.001). Mean RDRI was 0.81±0.14 in patients with AKI 0–2 and 0.71±0.08 in patients with AKI 3 (P<0.001).

Urinary creatinine excretion (UCE) may be a predictor of endogenous protein catabolism [2]. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between UCE and creatinine clearance (CrCl), in particular, with augmented renal clearance (ARC), during intensive care unit (ICU) admission.Methods:Retrospective study in adult patients admitted to a multipurpose ICU of a tertiary center during 12 months. Urine was collected for an 8-h period and daily UCE was calculated by extrapolation to 24h. Relative UCE was calculated as a percentage of theoretical values obtained with equations proposed by Walser [3].Results:A total of 407 patients were included, with a mean age of 62.3±17.3 years, and 35.4% were female. Mean CrCl in the first 2 days of admission was <60, 60-129 and ≥130mL/min/1.73 m2in 35.4%, 35.9% and 28.6% of patients, respectively. Considering only patients with a CrCl ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2, an analysis by age categories (20-39, 40-64 and 65-89 years), showed significant higher incidence of trauma on admission and higher CrCl in younger patients. Relative UCE in the first 2 days of admission was 119.4±37.5%, 114.5±39.5% and 115.0±42.6% for 20-39, 40-64 and 65-89 years groups (p=0.795) and decreased for all groups in the 3-7 days of admission period, with lower values for older patients (p=0.011). Relative UCE was positively associated with the presence of ARC in the different periods of time evaluated. In a multivariate logistic regression, 90-day mortality was not associated with relative UCE ≥ 100% or ARC.Conclusions:Critically ill patients showed increased relative UCE in the first days of ICU admission, which may be attributed to higher protein catabolism. Increased relative UCE was associated with ARC and both had no effect on 90-day mortality.References:1. Sharma K et al. Nutr Clin Pract 34: 12-22, 20192. Carlotti A et al.

We used the “Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes” (KDIGO) criteria for AKI and analyzed the first hospital admission. A total of 103161 were admitted in hospital and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Average observation period per patient was 248 days.Results:The incidence of CA-AKI among included hospital admissions was 9.7% compared with an incidence of 8.6% of HA-AKI, giving an overall AKI incidence of 18.3%. Patients with CA-AKI were younger than patients with HA-AKI (64 vs 66.2y) and had significantly less comorbidities, including preexisting cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes. Patients with CA-AKI were more likely to have stage 1 AKI (69,3 vs 58,4%, p<0.001) and had significantly shorter lengths of hospital stay than patients with HA-AKI (14 vs 24d, p<0.001).

Only 26% of practitioners checked net fluid balance hourly (70% nurses, 16% physicians). New hemodynamic instability, defined as new onset or worsening tachycardia, hypotension, or need to start or increase the dose of vasopressors was reported to occur in 20% patients (IQR 10.0–30.0). Different strategies to re-gain hemodynamic stability were used.

The effectiveness of the anticoagulation is important because replacing the hemofilter and tube interrupts CRRT and increases total therapy time.Regional Citrate Anticoagulation (RCA) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) are most commonly using methods for CRRT anticoagulation [2].The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy, safety and metabolic differences of the patients in ICU who underwent CRRT and anticoagulation method changed from UFH to RCA for different reasons.Methods:After ethics committee approval (2019-14/9) 100 patients who underwent CRRT between 2018-2019 at Bursa Uludag University Hospital ICU have been investigated and 11 patients who underwent CRRT by both RCA and UFH included in the study.

There is limited experience of use of citrate anticoagulation patients with acute liver failure and acute on chronic liver failure who pose a tough challenge of being at a higher risk for bleeding. An institutional protocol was formulated for use of commercially available citrate solutions and the same was studied to assess filter life and safety of citrate in liver disease. The primary objective was to assess safety of citrate anticoagulation in liver disease.Methods:This study was a single centre, prospective, non-randomized, single arm, observational study. All adult patients, with acute liver failure and acute on chronic liver failure requiring CRRT were included. Blood ionized calcium levels of 0.9 to 1.1mmol/l was targeted throughout the therapy and total to ionized calcium ratio of less than 2.4 was maintained. RCA was stopped if the ratio was more than 2.4 for 2 consecutive assessments. Incidence of citrate accumulation and toxicity were assessed. Average filter life was also assessed. Metabolic parameters, electrolytes and strong ion gap were followed till 24 hours after completion on CRRT.Results:A total of 25 patients were included in the study. Nineteen patients of acute on chronic liver failure and 6 patients of acute liver failure underwent CRRT with RCA.

Eleven consecutive episodes of CRRT were collected (a new episode characterized if CRRT was discontinued for 48 hours and above). One episode was excluded due to short duration (less than 4 hours). Patients undergoing RCA-CRRT received either a fixed 25 or 35 ml/kg/h effluent dose protocol.Results:Median patient age was 59, male 100%. Average time on CRRT was 4.1 days (2-9). 70% of the patients had complications, although 60% were minor (Figure 1). All of the patients with net citrate overload had citrate loads of 13.8mmol/h or above. The main risk factors were found to be shock and liver impairment which occurred in 60% of cases of which 40% developed complications.Conclusions:A fixed dose effluent protocol to standardise practice can potentially lead to a higher risk of minor complications. In our experience this is likely due to a lack of appropriate monitoring for RCA-CRRT complications. Despite this, our complication rate of citrate accumulation is in line with that reported in literature. Citrate loads in our 25 ml/kg/hr protocol were 22.6% higher than our 35 ml/kg/hr protocol and strongly related to higher complication rate that worsened in patients with risk factors for poor citrate metabolism.References:1.

An important reason for metabolic acidosis in AKI is increased unmeasured anions (UA) [2]. Delta-pH-UA (ΔpHUA) detects the degree of metabolic acidosis caused by UA and is calculated by using ‘The Partitioned pH Model’ [3]. In this study, we investigated whether ΔpHUAwas a predictor to start CRRT in patients with AKI.Methods:The study was designed as a multicentric, prospective, observational study in 2019. Patients who were ≥18 years old and diagnosed with AKI [1] were included. The moment AKI was diagnosed, arterial blood gas, albumin, magnesium, inorganic phosphorus, urea, creatinine and ΔpHUAvalues were recorded. All patients were divided into two groups as CRRT(-) and CRRT(+) which consists of patients performed CRRT due to traditional criteria.Results:90 of 709 patients (12.7%) were diagnosed as AKI. CRRT rates in stage I, II and III AKI were 0.2% (1/41), 47.1% (16/34) and 100% (15/15) respectively. When patients with stage II were evaluated, the only parameter which was significantly different between CRRT(+) and CRRT(-) was ΔpHUA(-0.124±0.076; -0.054±0.048) (p=0.001). Likewise, the only parameter which had significant UAC value to predict starting CRRT was also ΔpHUA(for≤-0.083; 0.82 [0.67-0.97]) (p=0.002). In the logistic regression model, the likelihood of starting CRTT was increased 25-fold (3.5-169) by only ΔpHUA≤-0.083 (p=0.001).Conclusions:ΔpHUAis prominently negative in patients with AKI performed CRRT and the only decisive parameter in stage II AKI in which clinicians have difficulty in deciding whether to start CRRT. Hence, we think that ΔpHUAmay be a promising parameter to detect the optimal timing of CRRT in AKI.References:1. KDIGO Guideline. 2012 Vol 2 Suppl 12. Kellum JA et al.

The 28-day mortality rate in the main group was 50% and was lower compared to the control group - 75%. During monitoring, in the main group 24 hours after the first removal of endotoxin, a decrease in the initially increased amount of activated CD14+Mo by 2.2 times, as well as functionally mature defensin+granulocytes (def+Gran) by 1.6 times was observed. IL-6, IL-10, and PCT decreased by 1.9; 17.8; and 1.2 times, respectively. During this period, the control group showed an increase in CD14+Mo and def+Gran, while IL-6, IL-10 did not change, and PCT increased 1.9 times. A day after the second removal of endotoxin and then 5 days later, the main group of IL-6, IL-10, and PCT continued to decline. In the control group, only IL-10 decreased after 3 days, the rest continued to grow.Conclusions:The cellular adsorption of endotoxin-bound CD14+Mo and mature def+Gran is an important part of the mechanism of action of the endotoxin removal device.P251 Does the endotoxin adsorption of PMX column saturate in 2"

Endotoxin (LPS) burden by endotoxin activity assay >0.90 may exceed 50 μg [1], so the dose and duration of PMX-HP could be insufficient to lower the LPS burden. To confirm this issue, we experimented in a closed-circuit with 24 h continuous LPS addition, and PMX can adsorb > 50μg [2]. Further, LPS concentration became constant within 2 h in the single LPS spike test for determining PMX-HP duration [3]. To prove our hypothesis that the single LPS spike test reflects the adsorption equilibrium, and not saturation, we added LPS intermittently to reaction.Methods:LPS (10 ng/mL) was mixed with 125 mL deactivated fetal calf serum as a reflux solution, as previously described [2]; this concentration is much higher than that observed in septic patients. We created a closed circuit that incorporates PMX-01R at 1/14ththe amount of an adult PMX and performed PMX-HP at 10 mL/min for 5 h. LPS was added in two shots (post 2 h: 1250 ng, 10 ng/mL; post 4 h: 3750 ng, 30 ng/mL). LPS was measured using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hr.Results:After an initial decrease between 0 and 1 h, LPS concentration did not decrease between 1 and 2 h after PMX-HP initiation. Post LPS pulse addition at 2 h, it increased and then decreased till 3 h. Futher, it did not decrease between 3 and 4 h, but it increased and then decreased again after LPS pulse addition post 4 h (Figure 1). LPS adsorption rates were 76.2, 43.4, and 40.7% at 2, 4, and 5 h, respectively.Conclusions:LPS adsorption capacity of PMX-01R was maintained even after two additional shots of LPS, suggesting that the constant LPS concentration in the previously reported LPS spike test might be indicative of adsorption equilibrium rather than saturation.References:1.

However the main Critical Care Societies don’t suggest it’s use, because of the negative RCT. Probably lacking of precise clinical end points and stratification of the patients may explain these results. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether 1- Patients submitted to CRRT with the oXiris stratified on the basal AKIN stage have different response. 2- This translates in a different clinical response.Methods:A coohort study included 65 patients admitted to three Intensive Care with sepsis / septic shock ( SEPSIS 3 Criteria ) and AKI ( AKIN score). All patients were submitted to CVVHDF with the oXiris filter (Baxter, USA) . The main clinical data, Il 6, Procalcitonin, Endotoxin ( EAA ) and SOFA score were evaluated at basal time ( T0 ) and at the end of the treatment ( T1 ). All data are expressed as mean ± SD or median and IQR . ANOVA TEST was used to compare the changes in the time.Results:60 patients were submitted to RRT with the oXiris filter for 46 ± 12 hours . 21 patients had AKI 3 stage , 13 patients AKI 2 stage and 25 patients had AKI 1 stage. At T0 all groups had an high vasopressor support to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mmHg. IL6, Procalcitonin EAA and SOFA total were also elevated with no difference between the groups. At T1 creatinine improved better in AKI 2 ( p< 0.001 vs. T0 ) and in AKI 1 ( p< 0.0001 vs T0) then in AKI 3 group. MAP increased in AKI 2 ( p< 0.01 vs T0) and AKI 1 ( p < 0.01 vs T0) , but not in AKI 3 group. IL6, procalcitonin decreased more in AKI 1 ( p < 0.0001 vs T0) then AKI 3 .

As an advanced dialysis system, the ADVOS procedure can eliminate water-soluble and protein-bound substances, regulate the acid-base balance as well as fluid and temperature. In 2017, a national registry was established to collect data under \"real-life\" conditions of patients treated with ADVOS without any trial-specific interventions (DRKS ID: DRKS00017068).Methods:Data from 01/2017 to 02/2019 from 4 German hospitals (university hospitals in Hamburg-Eppendorf, Mainz, Essen, and Klinikum Weiden) were analyzed. Clinical parameters, treatment settings and adverse events were documented. The 28- and 90-day mortality rates were compared with extrapolated rates based on the SOFA score.Results:118 patients with a median age of 60 years (IQR 45-69), of whom 70 (59%) were male, were evaluated. Patients had a median SOFA score of 14 (IQR: 11-17) before the 1st ADVOS treatment, which is associated with an expected mortality of 80%. The number of failing organs was 3 (IQR 2-4): cardiovascular (74%), lungs (57%), liver (47%), kidneys (74%), coagulation (69%) and CNS (29%). 429 treatments with a median duration of 16 (IQR: 10-20) hours were evaluated. 87 were discontinued, of which 25 (6%) were due to a device error. 79 adverse events were documented, 13 were related to the device (all due to clotting and recovered without sequelae).

We investigated the potential role of Cyclosporine (CsA) to prevent postoperative AKI and mitigate inflammatory response to extracorporeal circulation (ECC).Methods:Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled single-center study. Patients (n=67) scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were randomized to 2,5 mg/kg CsA or placebo before the surgery. The primary objective was to assess the role of CsA to reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI. The secondary objective was to study CsA induced changes in the inflammatory response to ECC.Results:All enrolled patients were analyzed. Postoperative AKI was more pronounced in the Cyclosporine group compared to placebo. OR=5.03 (1.76-15.74), 95% CI. The cytokine production in response to ECC was not affected by Cyclosporine (Figure 1).Conclusions:In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a single preoperative dose of CsA does not prevent the postoperative decrease in renal function. CsA does not alter cytokine release in response to extracorporeal circulation.

Serum kalemia, glycemia; hypokalemia, hypoglycemia episodes; rate of insulin interruption for hypo- and normoglycemia during ketoacidosis; use of NaH2CO3-for ketoacidosis, and LOS in ICU were analysed. SPSS 23.0 was used for statistic calculations. Traits evaluated as significant at p < 0.05.Results:At the beginning of DKA treatment in totally hypokalemia (3.1 ± 0.3 mmol/l) was recorded in 64/120 pt (53.3 %). Due to ignoring of blood pH (6.8 - 7.3 (7.0 ± 0.1) kalemia was falsely misinterpreted as “normo-“ or “hyper-“ 3.5 – 7.1 (5.1 ± 0.9 mmol/l) in 49/68 pt (72.1 %), thus disregarded so complicated by obvious hypokalemia additionally in 26/49 pt (53.1 %).

Central venous-arterial PCO2difference (Pcv-aCO2) is strictly related to cardiac output; central venous-arterial PCO2difference to arterial-central venous O2content difference ratio, Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2, has been proposed as anaerobic metabolism when it’s >1.4 mmHg/ml [1].Methods:To evaluate Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2reliability in detecting anaerobic metabolism, we analyzed it in 7 consecutive patients affected by MALA admitted to our ICU, considering these patients as a prevalent anaerobic metabolism model. We calculated, by Douglas formula, central venous-arterial CO2content difference to arterial-central venous O2content difference ratio, Ccv-CaCO2/Ca-CcvO2, as a Respiratory Quotient surrogate. We performed arterial and central venous blood gas analysis simultaneously at admission, we calculated Pcv-aCO2, Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2and Ccv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2and we recorded ScvO2. We verified relationship between Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2and ScvO2and arterial pH, arterial lactates, SOFA score at admission and Ccv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2by linear regression analysis.Results:Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 greatly increases in MALA (2.16 ± 0.84). Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 (Fig.1) shows significant co-variation with pH (R2=0.618; p=0.003) and SOFA score at admission (R2=0.628; p=0.003). Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 has poor agreement with Ccv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 (R2=0.008) and disagrees with it in identifying anaerobic metabolism, in our series, in fact, Ccv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is, in 3 patients, < 1 like an aerobic RQ value. Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 shows better agreement with pH, SOFA score and lactate level than ScvO2.Conclusions:In our series, Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2is good illness and acidosis severity marker, but it seems to be affected by pH value in accord with Haldane effect [2]. Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2, in our study, doesn’t seem to be a reliable anaerobic metabolism marker nor a RQ surrogate.References:1. Mekontso-Dessap A et al. Intensive Care Med 28:272-277, 2002.2.

Patients that received early basal insulin within 24 hours of initiation of IV insulin and before closure of the anion gap (AG) were compared to those that did not receive early basal insulin. The primary outcome was median TCAG. Secondary efficacy outcomes include: time on IV insulin infusion, time to de-escalation of level of care, hospital LOS, and re-elevation of AG. Secondary safety outcomes included incidences of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and hypokalemia.Results:A total of 334 patients were identified meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Median TCAG was longer in the experimental group (9 vs. 6 hours, p <0.01). Incidence of re-elevation of AG and incidence of hyperglycemia were lower in the experimental group. Other outcomes were similar (Figure 1).Conclusions:Early administration of basal insulin to patients with DKA resulted in a longer TCAG with a lower incidence of re-elevation of AG and hyperglycemia.

Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and glycemic variability are associated with mortality. The time in targeted blood glucose range (TIR) has been suggested to correlate with mortality depending on the status of antecedent glycemic control, but It has not been verified optimal TIR and whether there is an optimal disease-specific TIR.Methods:A retrospective observational study was performed at a single center. In the present study, we enrolled all critically ill patients admitted in intensive care unit from 1 January 2016 to 31 October. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome and patients who had < 10 blood glucose readings were excluded. Gathered information included, in part, demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness scores, diagnosis at admission, length of ICU stay and hospital discharge status. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We analyzed to find the optimal TIR for critically ill patients. Several TIRs were each tested for correlation with mortality.Results:A total of 1,523 patients, 51.8% of whom had diabetes, were studied. TIR 70 to 139 mg/dL (OR, 0.33; 95%CI, 0.18-0.58), TIR 70 to 179 mg/dL (OR, 0.33; 95%CI, 0.23-0.47) and TIR 110 to 179 mg/dL (OR, 0.28; 95%CI, 0.17-0.44) > 80 % was independently associated with mortality in critically ill patients respectively. The optimal TIR did not differ depending on diagnosis at admission.Conclusions:In this retrospective evaluation, TIR 110 to 179 mg/dL > 80 % was independently associated with mortality in critically ill patients, especially those with good antecedent glucose control. These findings have implications for the design of future trials of intensive insulin therapy.P262 Prevalence and impact of chronic dysglycemia in intensive care unit"

We aimed to determine the prevalence of such chronic dysglycemia and asses its impact on blood glucose control and patient-centred outcomes in critically ill patients.Methods:In this retrospective, observational study, we obtained routine glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured in patients admitted to four tertiary ICUs in Sweden between March and August 2016. Based on previous diabetes history and HbA1c we determined the prevalence of chronic dysglycemia (prediabetes, undiagnosed diabetes and known diabetes). We compared indices of acute glycemic control in the ICU and explored the association between chronic dysglycemia and ICU-associated infections, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressor therapy, and mortality within 90 days.Results:Of 943 patients, 312 (33%) had chronic dysglycemia. Of these 312 patients, 127 (41%) had prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes and 185 (59%) had a known diabetes diagnosis. During ICU stay, patients with chronic dysglycemia had higher average blood glucose, spent less time in target glucose range, had greater glucose variability, and were more likely to develop hypoglycemia than patients without chronic dysglycemia. Chronic dysglycemia was associated with greater need for renal replacement therapy (odds ratio 2.10, 95% CI 1.35-3.27) and increased 90-day mortality (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.77) after adjustment for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3.

A 68-year old male patient with diabetes mellitus suffered 10 days after colectomy surgery from abdominal pain and nausea. The patient had an antidiabetic therapy with empaglifozin that was paused until day 5 after surgery (nutrition start on day 5, weaning on day 6).Methods:This is a case report of one male patient seen in the ICU setting. Daily blood values including arterial blood gases, vital parameters and clinical status of the patient were observed and evaluated.Results:The blood gases showed this metabolic acidosis: pH 7.38; PCO2 20.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 12 mmol/l, BE -11.63 mmol/l, lactate 1.6 mmol/l, glucose 7 mmol/l. A ketonuria despite normal blood glucose values was noticed, so that the diagnosis of ketoacidosis was clear. After analyzing the possible causes we found out, that empaglifozin in times of catabolism and fasting can cause this severe symptomatic. We terminated the therapie with empaglifozin and under the treatment with insulin the symptoms disappeared within 3 days and the patient could be discharged from the ICU on day 17 after surgery. After one episode of ketoacidosis the therapy with SGLT2-inhibitors should lifelong never be started again.Conclusions:We recommend that intensivists should be aware of the modern SGLT2-inhibitors because of the shown severe complications and the increased use of this medication.Consent to publish: written informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.References:[1: SGLT2-Inhibitor Empagliflozin: Jardiance auf einen Blick, DtschArztebl International-34-11620, 2019P264 Unraveling the obesity paradox in the intensive care unit: a causal inference approachA Decruyenaere1, J Steen1, K Colpaert2, D Benoit2, J Decruyenaere2, S Vansteelandt31Ghent University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Gent, Belgium;2Ghent University Hospital, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Gent, Belgium;3Ghent University, Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Gent, BelgiumIntroduction:While obesity confers an increased risk of death in the general population, numerous studies have reported an association between obesity and improved survival among critically ill patients.

Two causal inference approaches are used to estimate the average treatment effect in the untreated (ATU): a naive approach that uses traditional regression adjustment for confounding and that assumes missingness completely at random, and a robust approach that uses super learning within the targeted maximum likelihood estimation framework and that uses multivariate imputation of missing values under the assumption of missingness at random.Results:Obesity is present in 18.9% of patients. The in-hospital mortality is 14.6% in non-obese patients and 13.5% in obese patients. The marginal associational risk difference for in-hospital mortality between obese and non-obese patients is -1.06% (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.23% to 1.11%, P=0.337). The naive approach results in an ATU of -2.48% (95% CI -4.80% to -0.15%, P=0.037), whereas the robust approach yields an ATU of -0.59% (95% CI -2.77% to 1.60%, P=0.599).Conclusions:A robust causal inference approach that may handle confounding bias due to model misspecification and selection bias due to missing data mitigates the obesity paradox, whereas a naive approach results in even more paradoxical findings. The robust approach does not provide evidence that the survival of non-obese critically ill patients would have been improved if they had been obese.P265 Patterns of bowel motions in ICU and the implementation of a stepwise management protocol to reduce decision fatigueC Cole, H McConnellRoyal Victoria Infirmary, Perioperative and Intensive care, Newcastle upon Tyne, United KingdomIntroduction:Bowel management within an ICU environment is often difficult. Recent data collection from an intensive care unit at the RVI identified either loose stool or constipation on > 50% of patient days. It was postulated this could be improved with a more tightly controlled bowel management regimen. To test this hypothesis a step-wise bowel protocol was created and introduced. Data was collected in the 4 month period following its implementation with the following aims:1) Assess effectiveness of the protocol2) Further observe the reasons for loose or constipated stool on an ICUMethods:Bowel data recorded once a day for each patient. A single recording was defined as ’one bowel day’. Definitions: Loose stool - type 5-7; Constipated - type 1-2 or BNO for > 3 days; ‘Normal bowel activity’ - type 3-4 or BNO < 3 days. In addition, the number and result of per rectal examinations performed was recorded.Results:1) 512 bowel days: Constipation 17%, ‘normal bowel’ 59%, loose stools 24%.

ACPO can result in colonic ischemia and perforation, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Reported risk factors include trauma, major surgery, sepsis, shock, electrolyte imbalance, renal failure and medications such as opiates, sedatives and anti-cholinergics [1]. To date there are few reports of ACPO in the intensive care cohort. We investigated the incidence and risk factors associated with ACPO.Methods:The ICU admission database was interrogated to identify all patients diagnosed with ACPO from October 2018 to October 2019. In study subjects, a retrospective chart review was carried out recording patient demographics, admission diagnosis and severity of illness. Charts were examined for risk factors associated with ACPO and for details of the management of ACPO once diagnosed.Results:Of 400 admissions, 7 patients (2 female) developed ACPO, (mean age 52.2 years, mean APACHE 2 score 15.6 (range 8-22). Five patients were admitted with respiratory failure. Mean time to diagnosis of ACPO was 7.1 days after ICU admission. All patients were mechanically ventilated at the time of diagnosis. Six patients received a cephalosporin as per stewardship guidelines. All patients were on corticosteroid therapy. One patient responded to conservative management and one patient is receiving ongoing treatment. Five patients developed a colonic perforation, 3 of these underwent emergency surgical intervention. All patients who developed a colonic perforation died.Conclusions:ACPO is a condition with multiple associations in critically ill patients and substantially increases mortality risk. Further research is required into causality to better inform prevention of ACPO in ICU patients.References:1.

We aimed to investigate the frequency and management of diarrhea in our ICU.Methods:In this study 47 patient retrospectively reviewed, in our ICU between 01.01.2017-03.01.2018. Patients were divided into two group as diarrhea “positive” and “negative”. Patients with diarrhea had fluid or loose stools 3 or more times a day. Each diarrhea period of the patients with diarrhea was examined separately and compared with the group without diarrhea. Nutritional status, enteral product formulation, leukocyte, neutrophil, albumin values, gastric sparing, antibacterial and antimycotic use, LOS in hospital and in ICU were compared. In diarrhea positive group, on the day of hospitalization, laxative and/or enema administration, toxin A in stool, nitrogen balance before and after diarrhea, enteral product change in diarrhea, probiotic, metronidazole or oral vancomycin use were examined.Results:The incidence of diarrhea was 68.3%. The most common diagnosis of ICU admision was respiratory failure (60-85%) in both groups. Diarrhea occurred in two days after laxative and/or enema treatment. Enteral nutrition was higher in both groups (≥90%). Nasogastric tube feeding was significantly higher in the diarrhea group (p=0.041). There was no difference between nutritional product formulation and diarrhea development (p>0,1). Antibacterial use was high in both groups (75%); however, Teicoplanin use was significantly higher in the group diarrhea negative group (p=0.028). The LOS in ICU, and hospital was higher in diarrhea group (p<0.001). No difference in mortality rates (p>0.5).Conclusions:Many factors may cause diarrhea in ICU, and diarrhea may adversely affect patient treatment and increase morbidity.

Inclusion criteria: males and females > 18 years of age, TBSA burned 20%-80%, nasogastric intubation.Patients were divided in two groups: glutamine group (n=25) and control group (n=17). In the study group enteral glutamine was administered to the patients for 5 days after admission to the ICU. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. No significant difference was found between groups on patients’ age, sex, TBSA, need for mechanical ventilation and rate of inhalation injury. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

We hypothesized that these outcome benefits are in part mediated by fasting-induced ketogenesis.Methods:This is a secondary analysis of the PEPaNIC RCT. First, to identify a potential time point of maximal effect of late vs. early PN, we quantified plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) in a matched subset of 96 patients with a PICU stay of ≥5 days. Thereafter, we quantified plasma 3HB and insulin on that “maximal effect” day (or last day for shorter stayers; 1142 patients with available sample). Associations of 3HB with outcomes were assessed with multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analyses, adjusted for baseline risk factors and randomization. In sensitivity analyses, models were further adjusted for key regulators of ketogenesis to assess whether any effect was direct or indirect.Results:Late PN increased plasma 3HB as compared with early PN, with maximal effect on day 2 (P<0.0001 for day 1 to 5 and for the “maximal effect” day in the 1142 patients). Adjusted for baseline risk and randomization, plasma 3HB associated with a higher likelihood of earlier live weaning from mechanical ventilation (P=0.0002) and of earlier live PICU discharge (P=0.004). As plasma 3HB replaced the effect of the randomization, the 3HB effect statistically explained these benefits of the randomization. Further adjustment for key regulators of ketogenesis did not alter these findings. Plasma 3HB did not independently associate with the risk of infections and mortality.Conclusions:Withholding early PN increased ketogenesis in critically ill children, an effect that statistically mediated part of its clinical benefits.P273 Interruptions of enteral nutrition and energy deficits in critically ill patients.

These interruptions can lead to adverse outcomes. The aim of the study was to determine the reasons for and the duration of interruptions of enteral nutrition (EN).Methods:Single-center observational, cross-sectional study in a 19-bed mixed ICU of a tertiary hospital. Duration: 6 months. 50 patients, aged 65.4 years old (±14.6), that stayed in the ICU > 48 hrs and were fed with EN were included. Anthropometric data, BMI, time of initiation of prescribed EN, type of EN formula, daily calories delivered were recorded. Energy intake was calculated according to ESPEN guidelines (25 Kcal/ kg BW/day). The causes for and duration of interruption were reviewed from the patient’s chart. APACHE II and mNutric score was calculated for all patients. mNutric score ≤5 was used to diagnose malnutrition.Results:All patients included in the study were endotracheally intubated. APACHE II was 22.4 ±5.6. 58% of patients had increased risk of malnutrition. ICU stay was 24.4 (8.0±32.0) days, and the in-hospital mortality was 24%. There were 318 episodes of EN interruptions over a median ICU stay of 24.4 days. Median 2.5 interruptions/patient. The most common reason for EN interruption was gastric residual volume monitoring followed by diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (Figure 1). Other reasons include surgery, intolerance and/or delayed feeding and extubation. The median lost feeding time was 5.4 hours/day (3.7-7.4) for all causes, while the mean loss of total energy intake was 790 kcal/day (±321)/day. Average body weight of the patients was 78 Kg (±12). Caloric deficit was calculated at 1950 Kcal/day or 40% of the prescribed caloric goal.Conclusions:The results of this study showed that interruptions can lead to substantial caloric deficit, malnutrition and adverse events.

This study aimed at investigating the relationship of goal-directed energy and protein adequacy on clinical outcomes which includes mortality, intensive care unit(ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), and length of mechanical ventilation (LOMV).Methods:This was a single centre prospective observational study. Nutritional requirements were guided by Indirect Calorimetry and 24-h urinary urea.Nutritional intake was recorded daily until death, discharge, or until day 14 of ICU stay. Clinical outcomes were collected from patient’s hospital record. The relationship between the two groups (<80% and ≥80% of overall nutritional requirement) with mortality outcomes was examined by using logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders.Results:Data were collected from 314 critically ill patients (age, 53.6±18.9 years; 63.4% male; body mass index, 25.7±7.2 kg/m ; APACHE II score,23.5±6.2). Patients in the ≥80% of nutritional requirement group (n=207) had a higher mean energy adequacy (97.9±12.3 vs. 65.4±14.7 %,p<0.001) and protein adequacy (96.8±21.2 vs. 67.3±24.1 %, p<0.001). Overall, no significant difference between <80% or ≥80% of energy adequacy in mortality outcomes in univariate and multivariate analysis. Energy adequacy was not associated with 60-day mortality when adjusted for protein adequacy (Adj OR 0.668; 95% CI, 0.332 – 1.343; p=0.257). However, energy adequacy of ≥80% signicantly increased ICU LOS (p<0.001), hospital LOS (p=0.02) and LOMV (p<0.001).Conclusions:Goal-directed energy and protein adequacy of ≥80% associated with increased ICU LOS, hospital LOS and LOMV, but not associated with mortality outcomes. Based on this result, energy provision should be conservative during the acute phase of critical illness. The optimal protein dose requires further investigation.P275 Terlipressin-induced hyponatremia in acute gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertensionCC Castelo Branco, RA Alves, AP PintoCentro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Anesthesiology, Emergency and Critical Care, Porto, PortugalIntroduction:Terlipressin, despite being one of the main"

Alcohol-related liver disease was the most frequent etiology. Hyponatremia occurred in 53 patients (27.7%). Serum Na ∆between -5 and -10mEq and serum Na ∆>-10mEq occurred in 20.4 and 7.3%, respectively (Table 1).

We analyzed our database to identify factors determining poor outcome: the composite of in-hospital death from any cause and rebleeding after days 5 and 45.Methods:During the period 2007-2019, 87 patients with variceal bleeding were treated in our institution. On admission data including patient characteristics and laboratory findings were assessed and further analyzed. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of poor outcome.Results:Twelve patients died (10.4%) and 24 (20.8%) patients had a poor outcome. Integrated multivariate model: albumin (p=0.14), active alcoholism (p=0.09), portal thrombosis (p=0.01), mechanical ventilation assistance (p=0.24), creatinine (p=0.04), base excess (p=0.09), encephalopathy (p=0.07), heart rate (p=0.99), white blood cells (p=0.05), MELD (p=0.08), mean arterial pressure (p=0.04), platelets (p=0.48), prothrombin time (p=0.72) and gastric varices (p=0.01). In the multivariate model the presence of portal thrombosis, elevated creatinine, diminished mean arterial pressure and gastric varices were independent associated with poor outcome in cirrhotic patients admitted for variceal bleeding. (AUC ROC 0.90; 95% IC: 0.82-0.95).Conclusions:The presence of portal thrombosis, elevated creatinine, diminished mean arterial pressure and gastric varices were independent associated with poor outcome in cirrhotic patients admitted for variceal bleeding.P278 Impact of acute liver failure on bleeding risk in critical care settings; a"

We aimed to evaluate the bleeding risk of ALF among critically ill patients.Methods:We analyzed 200,859 critically ill patients from multi-center database who admitted to 335 Intensive care units (ICUs) in the United States between 2014 and 2015, which is monitored by eICU Programs. Patients without diagnosis of trauma and bleeding on admission were included. Primary outcome was all hemorrhage occurred during ICU stay. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of bleeding in ICU.Results:Of 153,691 patients included in this study, 428 were ALF. Bleeding events were occurred in 1,817 (1.18%) patients. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were occurred in 488 (0.32%), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding were in 827 (0.54%) cases. On multivariable Logistic regression analysis, variables significantly associated with all hemorrhage were ALF (Odds ratio[OR] 4.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]:2.52-6.77; p<0.0001), older age, African American, Hispanic, and Native American ethnicity, cardiac arrest, stroke, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and history of GI bleeding. ALF were also associated with intracranial hemorrhage (OR:8.54; 95%CI:3.09-23.6, p<0.0001), and GI bleeding (OR:5.25; 95%CI:3.03-9.08; p<0.0001 ).

In order to explore the effect of lactic acid bacteria on intestinal barrier function impaired by sepsis, it is necessary to establish sepsis and lactic acid bacteria ecological models. However, how to construct these models is still unclear.Methods:Co-cultures with a gradient of lactic acid bacteria and Caco-2 cells were constructed. The symbiotic state was observed under an inverted microscope and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) toxicity tests, transepithelial electrical resistance(TEER) tests and Western blots were used to determine effective concentrations of lactic acid bacteria in monolayer cell models. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to treat cells, and Cell Counting Kit-8, quantitative reverse transcription PCR(RT-qPCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to determine the appropriate concentration for sepsis models.Results:The number of living cells decreased significantly when the MOI(number of lactic acid bacteria/cell number) reached 8 (Figure 1, panels 1a, b). The release of LDH indicated that damage to cells began to increase when the MOI exceeded 10 (panels 2a, b). At an MOI of 0.5, resistance values began to increase over time, whereas resistance values began to decrease when the MOI reached 10 (panel 3).

Many previous studies reported a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in critically ill patients; however, data about vitamin D status are limited in adult patients with sepsis who visited an emergency department (ED). Therefore, we decided to evaluate the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vit D) level on sepsis severity and risk of hospitalization in the adult septic patient who visited ED.Methods:Cross-sectional study was conducted in the ED of the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Bangkok, Thailand, from 1 March to 30 September 2015. Patients age ≥ 18 who diagnosed with sepsis were enrolled. 25-OH vit D level was analyzed correlated with illness severity of sepsis measured by APACHE-II and MEDS score using linear regression analysis. And the risk of hospitalization was analyzed using logistic regression analysis.Results:One hundred and one patients were enrolled. On average, there were 67.9±18.2 years old, 56% (n=57) were female, APACHE-II score = 14.2±6.3, MEDS score = 7.9±4.6, and 25-OH vit D level = 18.5±11.3 ng/mL. The admission rate in our cohort was 88% (n=89). Significant correlations between 25-OH vit D level and sepsis severity scores were found, which measured by APACHE-II and MEDS score (coef -0.12; 95%CI, -0.22 to -0.006, p -0.04 and – 0.10; 95%CI, -0.17 to -0.02, p = 0.02, respectively).

As the severity increases, physiological parameters such as pH changes are one of the most notable features in metabolic acidosis secondary to high lactate. Currently there is no point of care test other than blood gas measurement that could detect these pH changes. This is challenging especially in prehospital environment. The aim of this study is to develop a novel rapid point of care testing using a sensor to detect pH change in blood.Methods:Sensors were produced by screen printing graphene and silver electrodes and functionalizing the graphene working electrode with an active layer of melanin. A preclinical sensor model was produced by adding lactic acid to a citrated plasma sample thus altering its pH over a clinically relevant range. The pH sensors were exposed to modified plasma, recording any changes in the voltage. The relationship between the voltage potential and plasma pH was established using weighted least squares regression.Results:A pH dependent change in the measured voltage, with respect to the pH of the solution, was observed with a sensitivity of -111.27 mV/pH +/- 15.95 over a physiologically relevant pH range between pH7.1 and pH7.6.Conclusions:In this first phase proof of concept study a low cost, pH sensor was fabricated and demonstrated to be effective in measuring the pH of the plasma. This is the first time that such a sensor has been demonstrated and validated to work in this preclinical model of acidosis. The technology demonstrated here is a promising candidate for a point of care test whereby abnormal blood pH levels can be detected and monitored outside of a laboratory environment in a rapid manner.

New hand-held oximeter enables monitoring of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in prehospital setting. We aimed to assess the feasibility of the new device during prehospital anaesthesia.Methods:We performed a prospective, observational pilot study in two anaesthesiologist-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) units. Adult patients who underwent rapid sequence intubation and prehospital anaesthesia because of any reason were included by the HEMS team. NIRS monitoring of left frontal cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) with Nonin H500 oximeter system was performed throughout the prehospital anaesthesia. The rSO2records were reviewed in terms to identify potentially artefact values caused e.g. moving or transporting the patient.Results:Total of 97 patients were enrolled in the study. Due to technical problems or user error adequate monitoring was not achieved in 13 (13%, 95% confidence interval 8 to 22%) patients. Software update of the monitor was installed during the study and no monitoring failures occurred afterwards. No difference was observed in the on-scene-time during the study period compared to eligible patients treated in four previous years. Proportion of likely artefact values was 5.5% in total (median 0.99%, Q1-Q3 0,25%-6.18%).Conclusions:Monitoring cerebral oxygenation with Nonin H500 hand-held oximeter system during prehospital anaesthesia is feasible. The value of this new modality available for prehospital critical care providers needs to be further evaluated.P284 Risk-adjusted management strategies for patients admitted with acute pulmonary embolism to a teaching hospital in the UKT Owen, N BunkerRoyal London Hospital, Critical Care Unit, London, United KingdomIntroduction:Risk stratification of patients with acute PE helps to determine the most appropriate treatment.

The mean age was 55.6 years old (median 55). Right ventricular (RV) strain pattern was present in 10% (n=16). The majority of PE’s were unprovoked (39%), other causes included immobility (33%), cancer (17%), deranged clotting (10%) and pregnancy (1%). 45 (27%) patients were PESI III/IV of these 7 (4%) had both echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular strain and elevated troponin values. 13 (8%) Patients had died at time of data collection with the majority of deaths (n=6) within the PESI V class (Figure 1).Conclusions:Over one year only a small proportion of patients (n=7, 4%) were classified as ‘Intermediate High’ risk and potential candidates for reperfusion therapies. The average age of PESI class 3 or 4 Patients was 74.8 years (median=78). Extremes of age skew the PESI score disproportionately and a number of ‘Intermediate High’ risk patients would likely not be clinically suitable for reperfusion therapies. Adoption of the ESC’s proposed treatment algorithm would therefore likely place minimal additional burden on HDU services.References:1. Konstantinides SV et al.

These ED triage systems are either clinically-based, being more sensitive or ECG-based, more specific [1]. The goal of the study was to evaluate if incorporation of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) into ECG-based triage could increase his diagnostic performance.Methods:CECIDOC is a prospective, observational, single-center study in an academic Hospital. All consecutive adult patients admitted for acute chest pain were included. We compared the ECG-based FRENCH triage system [2] to a modified system upgrading patients with a normal ECG but significant cardiovascular risk from a low acuity triage score (waiting period before medical assessment of max. 60 min.) to a high acuity triage score (waiting period before medical assessment of max. 20 min.). The final diagnosis was determined after a 30-day follow-up. We predefined as being adequate a high-acuity triage score (level 1 or 2) for ACS and a low-acuity score (level 3, 4 or 5) for mild severity diseases.Results:A total of 190 patients was enrolled over a 5-month period (age 56.8 ±16.4; M/F ratio 1.7). Triage scores of 35 patients (18.4%) with ACS were compared to 103 patients (54.2%) with mild severity diseases. Taking into account CVRF, the sensitivity of the triage system increased from 60 to 80% whereas the specificity decreased from 74 to 61%.

There are currently no UK guidelines regarding the optimal use of CT head scans (CTH) in this patient cohort [2, 3]. This study aims to determine whether we should be performing CT head scans in obtunded patients with suspected overdose requiring admission to Intensive Care.Methods:We performed a retrospective search of the ICNARC database for Plymouth University Hospital Trust, looking for patients admitted to the ICU with overdose or self-poisoning as a primary diagnosis. 146 patients were identified and 86 of these patients required intubation due to obtundation(GCS<8).Results:There were 59 males and 27 females with an average age of 38 years old. The median length of stay on the unit was 1 day. 52 of the patients has a past medical history of mental illness, and 53 overdosed on prescribed medications. The average GCS recorded on admission was 5. 52 of the 86 (64%) patients had a CTH on admission, of which 5 were part of a trauma scan. 11 were known overdoses and 7 were suspected overdose as per the CTH request form. The main rationale behind those requests were to exclude additional intracranial injury. None of those CTH showed any signs of acute pathology (Figure 1).Conclusions:In this retrospective study, obtunded patients with suspected or known overdose with no history of apparent trauma or injury do not benefit from CTH.

The aim of this study was to identify morphological and epigenetic alteratons in brain neurons during acute exposure to clozapine combined wit ethanol.Methods:The experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats weighting 200–250g (n=21). Group I (control) received 0.9% NaCl solution enterally; group II — clozapine 150 mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl solution; group III — clozapine 150 mg/kg in 40% ethyl alcohol. After 4 hours euthanasia was performed. Autopsy included withdrawal of brain samples for histological examination (n = 21) and for determination of global DNA methylation level (n = 21). The global DNA methylation level (5-mC%) was determinated by fluorimetric method. Inter-group comparisons were made by Kruskal-Wallis test. Histological examination of paraffin sections of brains stained with hematoxylin and eosin was performed by light microscopy.Results:Histological examination of the cerebral cortex of animals received clozapine and clozapine with alcohol established alterations in the contours of nerve cells, neuronal hyperchromatosis and nuclear deformation, eccentric positon location of the nucleoli, consolidation of Nissl bodies. Increased global DNA methylation level was found in the ‘clozapine+alcohol’ group compared to the control group and ‘clozapine’ group (2.56±0.3140 vs. 1.35±0.1069 and 1.70±0.3295, p <0.02).Conclusions:In acute сlozapine poisoning and its combination with ethanol morphological changes in neurons of the cerebral cortex were detected. In acute сlozapine with alcohol poisoning an increase of global DNA methylation level was observed. Probably the identified changes have a common pathogenesis which will be clarified in our further studies.P292 Prevalence, treatment and outcome of adder bites in South West Wales.

Although non-aggressive if disturbed adders may bite, envenomation can be life threatening or even fatal. There is limited information available regarding the prevalence of adder bites and the complications of envenomation. NHS data suggests there are 100 adder bites annually in the UK with the last fatality in 1975 [1]. We performed an audit into adder bites in South West Wales to identify the number attending our Emergency Departments, their management and clinical course as well as any environmental factors that predict increased likelihood of being bitten or the severity of the bite.Methods:A retrospective study of adder bites attending Emergency Departments in South West Wales was undertaken (Jan 2014 to Aug 2019). Measurements included were patient demographics, clinical presentation, type of treatment (conservative vs anti-venom) and outcome.Results:31 patients were included, age range 2-72 years (Figure 1). The majority of bites occurred in sand dunes (41.9%) and all bites were on extremities. Anti-venom was administered to 45.2% (14/31) of patients. There was a significant positive association between the use of anti-venom and the length of hospital stay (r = 0.520; p=0.003) and a significant negative correlation between the anti-venom use and both diastolic and systolic blood pressure (p= 0.501 and 0.487 respectively p=0.01). All patients fully recovered.Conclusions:In this study, we demonstrated that with a full clinical assessment on presentation it is safe to decide whether anti-venom is required. The current guidelines are safe and effective in the treatment of adder bites.References:1. Snake Bites, NHS Conditions, 2016.

However, the impact of great disaster on basic life support activities of laypersons is unknown. The East Japan Earthquake swept the Pacific coast of Japanese mainland on Friday 11 March 2011, and caused nuclear accidents. This study aimed to investigate whether and how this disaster influenced bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) in family- and friends-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs).Methods:From nationwide OHCA registry, we extracted 74,684 family and friend bystander-witnessed OHCA cases without prehospital physician-performed advance life support, which were recorded between 11 March, 2010 and 10 March, 2013. The alterations in BCPR rate after the disaster in Tsunami-affected prefectures and others were analysed by univariate and multivariable analyses.Results:The BCPR rate in Tsunami-affected prefecture decreased in a biphasic manner during 20-weeks period after the onset of disaster in disaster year of 2011, compared to pre-disaster 2010 and post-disaster 2012: 42.5% (375/882) in 2011 and 48.2% (754/1565) in 2010&2012. This decrease in BCPR rate in tsunami-affected prefectures was more prominent in the subgroup receiving dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction (Figure 1). A lower rate of dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction (49.1% vs 53.4%) and higher proportion of presumed cardiac aetiology (62.8% vs 56.0%) were also observed during the same period of 2011 in Tsunami-affected prefectures. One-month survival rate of the family- and friends-witnessed subgroup receiving dispatcher-assisted CPR was 8.2% in 2011 and 10.2% in 2010/2012. In Tsunami-unaffected prefectures, the changes in BCPR rate and outcome of family- and friends-witnessed OHCA were extremely small.Conclusions:A great disaster affects the family- and friend-performance of BCPR by diminishing the willingness of family and friend bystanders to follow the instruction provided by dispatchers.References:1.

The Japanese Coalition for Patient Safety has set a major goal for hospitals to more widely implement the RRS. However, prevalence and actual circumstances of use in acute care hospitals (including small scale hospitals) in Japan are as yet not well-known.Methods:Web-based questionnaires were sent to acute care hospitals (of scale 75 beds-or-larger) of 17 prefectures in western Japan. Each participant hospital selected a certain department which answered the questionnaire. The RRS included the medical emergency team (MET), the rapid response team (RRT), and the critical care outreach team (CCOT). We investigated the presence and circumstances of in-hospital emergency calls, RRS and other systems, and then illuminated issues to be solved.Results:Among the 971 hospitals which questionnaires were distributed to, a total of 149 hospitals (15.3%) replied. The in-hospital emergency call and RRS were operated in 117 (78.5%) and 26 (17.4%) hospitals, respectively. Among the middle-to-small scale hospitals with ≤ 200 beds, both in-hospital emergency calls and RRS were less frequently operated than larger hospitals with > 200 beds (69.6% vs. 83.9%, p=0.04; 5.4% vs. 24.7%, p=0.003, respectively). Several hospitals operated non-team services through a certified critical care nurse. Data of activities was registered to the In-Hospital Emergency Committee in Japan in 7 (4.6%) hospitals. Satisfaction rates with the effectiveness of their own RRS were 60%, and problems to be resolved were shortage of staff and knowledge, and a lack of flow during response.Conclusions:Compared to larger hospitals with > 200 beds, the prevalence of the RRS was significantly lower in middle-to-small scale hospitals.

Transfusion reactions were found to be more frequent in emergency transfusions (p <0.01). The number of transfusions was significantly lower in patients with APACHE II score <20 (p <0.01). The need for transfusion was found to be higher in patients with hematological malignancy (p <0.01). It was observed that as the mean number of transfusions increased the mortality is also increased (p <0.01).Conclusions:Transfusion therapies are the treatments that are vital but have a serious mortality and morbidity risk. In particular, intensive care patients should be considered in detail because of their specific features. Restrictive transfusion practices have positive results.References:1. Vincent JL.

However, the effects on blood flow have been found to be conflicting.Methods:We studied ICU patients with stable hemodynamic status (mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg for at least 6 hours) and without active bleeding, who received a RBCT. Skin blood flow (SBF) was determined (Periflux System 5000, Perimed, index finger; perfusion unit, PU) together with MAP, heart rate (HR), hemoglobin (Hb), lactate levels and ScvO2before and after RBCT. SBF was measured before RBCT (T0) and after (T1) for each 3 min. According to previous data indicating the lowest SBF value found in non-infected ICU patients was 151 PU, all patients were analyzed according to the baseline SBF (i.e. <151 PU - low SBF vs. ≥151 PU – high SBF). The relative change of SBF (∆SBF) was calculated after RBCT and the responders were defined by the function of >10%.Results:63 ICU patients were studied. RBCT was associated with increases in MAP and ScvO2but no change in SBF. At baseline, ScvO2was lower in the responders than in the non-responders (p=0.04) and lower in patients with low SBF than in the high SBF (p=0.04). There was no difference in Hb, MAP, and lactate, between the patients with low and high SBF. After RBCT, MAP rose in the responders (p<0.01) and in the non-responders (p=0.03), SBF (p<0.01) rose in patients with low SBF, and SBF (p=0.02) decreased in patients with high SBF.

While it can save lives in hemorrhagic shock, its efficacy is more uncertain in moderate anemia of inflammatory origin. There is still considerable debate about the risks / benefits and indications of transfusion of ET in patients with non-hemorrhagic anemia. We aimed to study the effects of ET on hemodynamic and oxygen metabolism.Methods:Comparative cross-sectional study on matched series before / after ET. Patients receiving ET for non-hemorrhagic anemia (Hb <7 g / dL) were eligible. Ultrasound Cardiac output (CO), arterial and central venous blood gas were performed before and 2h after transfusion. Blood Formula Count (BFC) was collected 24 hours after ET. All hemodynamic and O2 metabolism parameter’s (using the following formulas: arterial O2 content (CO2, ml / dl) = 1.34 (ml / g) x Hb (g / dl) x SO2 + [(0.0031 x PO2 (mm Hg)] and Oxygen delivery (DO2, ml / min) = CO (l / min) x CO2 x 10) and hematologic were compared before/after ET by paired samplesResults:20 patients were included of 43 years as median age and median SOFA = 6. The median Hb indicating ET was 6.6 [6.2-6.9]. After transfusion of 1 RBC pellet: CO2 (ml / dl) increased from 8.9 [8.5-9.3] to 10.4 [9.4-11.3] with p <10-3. CO (l / min), and DO2 (ml / min) decreased but did not reach significance: CO: 5.6 [4.4 -7.01] vs 4.6 [3.8-6.7] and p = 0.33, CI: 3.2 [2.4-4.1] vs 2.4 [2.3-3, 8] and p = 0.16, OD2: 522 [402-623] vs 503 [433-666] and p = 0.17. Hematological parameters increased (p <10-3for all) with a change in Hb (g / dl) from 6.6 [6.2-6.9] to 7.9 [7.02 -8.4], hematocrit (%) of [19-22] to 24 [22-25] and GR count (106 / ml) of 2.47 [2.14-2.75] to 2, 9 [2.49 to 3.22].Conclusions:Our results tend to confirm that, despite the improvement of CO2 after ET, DO2 does not improve (ultimate goal of transfusion!). This effect seems to be due to the decrease of the CO consequent to the increase of blood viscosity.P308 Local audit of blood transfusion practices in comparison with NICE blood transfusion guidelines 2015MH SultanLahore General Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, Department of Internal Medicine, Lahore, PakistanIntroduction:This audit was carried out to objectively inspect flaws in technique of blood transfusion in both medical emergency and internal medicine wards.Methods:A questionnaire was designed with reference to NICE blood transfusion guidelines 2015 and data was collected from 102 House Officers and Post-graduate Residents after permission from Head of"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intravenously given fytomenadion on routine coagulation status, activities of vitamin K- dependent coagulation factors, thrombin generation and thromboelastography.Methods:Critically ill patients with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) – Owren (PT-INR) >1.2) were included during office hours. Routine coagulation status (Owren PT, Quick PT), activity of coagulation factor (F) II, FVII, FIX, FX, protein C, protein S, thrombin generation (TGA) and thromboelastography (ROTEM), were measured before and 24 hours after 10 mg fytomenadion had been given intravenously. The exclusion criteria were on-going treatment with warfarin- or NOACs, hepatocellular cancer, liver resection <6 months, known coagulopathy or treatment with fytomenadion <36 hours.Results:27 patients were included. A significant decrease of Owren PT and Quick PT was demonstrated 24 hours after given fytomenadion (p<0.001), Figure 1.

The correlation of CS and FCS vs equivalent ROTEM parameters was strong with r-values of 0.83 and 0.78, respectively.Conclusions:This first clinical experience with the Quantra in trauma patients showed that the QStat Cartridge detected coagulopathies associated with critical bleeding and may be useful for directing blood product transfusions in these patients.

Data from patients with fibrinogen deficiency having received FIBRYGA® from December 2017 to July 2019 were retrieved from their medical files. Indications, modalities, efficacy and safety outcomes were recorded. Indications encompassed non-surgical bleeding (NSB) either spontaneous or traumatic, including post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), bleeding during surgery (SB) or administration to prevent bleeding during planned surgery. Treatment success was defined as control of the bleeding or hemoglobin loss <20% for bleeding treatment and as absence of major perioperative hemorrhage"

Cardiac surgeries were the main procedures associated with treatment and prevention of SB. Mean total doses of FC were 2.95±1.66g, 2.00±1.37g and 2.21±1.23g for NSB, SB and prevention of SB. Success rates were 88.4% (95%CI 78.8-98.0%), 96.8% (95%CI 90.6-100%) and 91.2% (95%CI 81.6-100%) respectively. For PPH, mean dose of HF was 2.53±0.74g with a success rate of 86.7% (95%CI 69.5-100%). Overall, tolerance was good.Conclusions:Fibrinogen concentrate FIBRYGA® is mostly used for bleeding control.

Effective plasma concentrations are still under discussion [2]. In this prospective, observational trial using modified viscoelastometry we evaluated the time-course of the antifibrinolytic activity of TXA in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.Methods:25 patients were included. Modified viscoelastometry (TPA-test) was performed and TXA-plasma-concentration, plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and PAI-antigen-plasma-concentrations were measured over 96h. Additionally, in vitro dose-effect-curves from blood of healthy volunteers were performed. Data presented as median with interquartile range (Q1/Q3).Results:TXA plasma-concentration was increased compared to baseline (T1:0 μg ml-1) at every time-point with a peak concentration 30min (T2) after application (p<0.0001; see Fig.1A). Lysis was inhibited from 30min (LysisTimeTPA-test: p<0.01; LysisOnsetTimeTPA-test:p<0.0001). MaximumLysisTPA-testwas decreased at T2 (T1:97% (96/97) vs. T2: 9% (6/11); p<0.0001). Of note, after 24h some patients (n=17) had normalized lysis whereas others (n=8) had strong lysis inhibition (ML<30%;p<0.05) up to 96h. High and low lysis groups differed regarding kidney function (cystatin C:1.64mg l-1(1.42/2.02) vs. 1.28mg l-1(1.01/1.52);p=0.002) and active PAI-1 (93.05ng ml-1(33.15/9100.0) vs. 16.13ng ml-1(6.62/79.98);p=0.047).

Data were collected from paper and electronic records. The study was approved by the institutional ethical committee. 60 patients were included in the analysis, 19 operated in 2012, before fibrinogen concentrate was approved for human use, and 41 in 2018-2019. Therapy was guided by a rotational thrombo-elastometry (ROTEM) algorithm. Exclusion criteria were non-compliance with the institutional protocol and intra-operative death. We investigated allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT), fibrinogen use, peri-operative bleeding (POB), surgical re-exploration and post-operative complications (POC).Results:The groups were similar in gender, age, body weight, additive EuroScore and aortic cross-clamp time. Fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and red blood cell transfusion were lower in the fibrinogen group, but not platelet transfusion (table). 48,7% of patients in the study group received fibrinogen concentrate and median dose was 2 g (IQR 2-3). Day 1 postoperative chest tube drainage and surgical re-exploration were significantly lower. There were no differences in stroke, renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation time and ICU stay.Conclusions:In patients with TAAD surgery, ROTEM-guided algorithms which include fibrinogen concentrate are associated with less (POB), surgical re-exploration and ABT.

The analysis is carried out using defined reagents of the external (EXTEM), internal pathways (INTEM), fibrinogen (FIBTEM) or methods to diagnose pathological or iatrogenic disorders. Limited channels may decrease time availability under certain circumstances. The combination of reagents could allow for the same information from a smaller amount of examination. We have designed the IFiTEM test, which combines internal pathway activator with a platelet aggregation inhibitor (cytochalazin D).Methods:Prospective observational study approved by the local ethical board of the University hospital, Plzen in a cohort of 80 patients over 18 years in whom a ROTEM assessment was indicated during routine perioperative or intensive care. Conventional coagulation (serum fibrinogen and platelet count) and routinely performed methods (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM) were examined. The experimental IFiTEM test was performed using a combination of liquid reagents by adding cytacholizin D to the INTEM test. The maximal clot firmness (MCF), the difference of the MCF with and without the added inactivator (dIN=MCF(INTEM)–MCF(IFiTEM); dEX=MCF(EXTEM)–MCF(FIBTEM)) and conventional tests were examined.Results:Results of the ROTEM and standard laboratory tests are displayed in the Figure 1. A close correlation was observed between the MCF of EXTEM vs. INTEM (r = 0.97) and FIBTEM vs. IFiTEM (r = 0.89). Correlation between MCF(IFiTEM) and fibrinogen serum level (r=0.82) was comparable to the MCF(FIBTEM) (r=0.88). The platelet count showed similar (though lower) correlation with the dIN (r=0.80) and dEX (r=0.80) parameters.Conclusions:The experimental method IFiTEM could be an alternative of FIBTEM in cases when internal coagulation pathways assessment is prioritized (i.e. heparinized patients on extracorporeal supports).AcknowledgementSupported by the program for the Development of Scientific Fields of Charles University (Progres Q39)Fig. 1 (abstract P320).Standard and ROTEM"

Andexanet alfa may also neutralize the anti-Xa effects of betrixaban and edoxaban. This study aims to compare the relative neutralization of these four anti-Xa agents by andexanet alfa in different matrices.Methods:Andexanet alfa was diluted at 10 mg/ml. Apixaban (A), betrixaban (B), edoxaban (E) and rivaroxaban (R) were diluted in pH 8.4, 0.5 M tris buffer (TB), blood bank plasma (BBP) and in 5% albuminated buffer (AB) at 0.062 - 1.0 ug/ml. Anti-Xa activities of all four agents were measured in three systems and the reversibility indices of AA were profiled. The reversibility index (RI50) of anti-Xa effects by AA was determined at 25 - 100 ug/ml.Results:Each of the four agents produced varying degrees of inhibition of anti-Xa at 0.062 – 1.0 ug/ml, the IC50ranged 0.61 - 1.53 ug/ml in BBP, 0.47 - 1.28 ug/ml in AB and 0.49 - 1.4 ug/ml in TB. Andexanet alfa produced a concentration dependent reversal of all four anti-Xa agents. In the BBP, the RI50values for A (192 ug/ml), B (32 ug/ml), E (152 ug/ml) and R (85 ug/ml). In the AB, the RI50values for A (140 ug/ml), B (46 ug/ml), E (176 ug/ml) and R (58 ug/ml). In the TB, the RI50values for A (154 ug/ml), B (79 ug/ml), E (>400 ug/ml) and R (110 ug/ml).Conclusions:Each of the four anti-Xa agents exhibit varying degrees of matrix independent anti-Xa potencies in different systems, the collective order follows edoxaban > apixaban > betrixaban > rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa produced matrix dependent differential neutralization of the anti-Xa effects of these agents.

The relationship between devices was assessed via correlation, Bland-Altman agreement and diagnostic predictive values.Results:In 72 independent paired INR measurements using PoC (range 1.0 - 2.4) and LAB (range 0.9 – 1.4) devices in 37 ICU patients (1 - 4 samples/patient) we determined a Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.76 and Bland-Altman mean difference (bias) 0.01; 95% limits of agreement 0.33 (Figure 1). A PoC INR ≤ 1.2 had a 0.96 negative predictive value for a LAB INR ≥ 1.4 and a PoC INR ≥ 1.3 had a 1.0 positive predictive value for a LAB INR ≥1.4.Conclusions:PoC device INR measurements correlate relatively well with LAB measurements within this target INR range of interest in adult intensive care patients.

There is controversy as to the accuracy of this method due to the inherent differences in physicochemical properties as well as the underlying effects of individual diseases in arterial and venous blood. Clot microstructure has shown to be a new biomarker (fractal dimension- df) which encompasses the effects of diseases in all aspects of the coagulation system [1, 2]. In this study, we compared the effect of all these factors in venous and arterial blood to see if there is a difference in the clot microstructure and quality.Methods:45 patients admitted to a tertiary intensive care unit and busy teaching hospital were recruited. Arterial and venous blood was sampled from an arterial line and central venous catheter in situ from the same patient. Standard markers of coagulation (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, full blood count), rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), whole blood impedance aggregometry and measured clot microstructure (df) were measured on both arterial and venous samples.Results:No significant difference was observed in standard laboratory markers, ROTEM and platelet aggregation between arterial and venous blood. There were no differences in the fractal dimension (df) between the arterial and venous blood samples (df1.658 ± 0.10 vs 1.654 ± 0.08 respectively, p=0.830).Conclusions:Samples from patients with critical illness give comparable results from either arterial or venous blood despite their underlying pathophysiological process or treatment.

Current methods rely on the anticoagulant effect of citrate on whole blood prior to laboratory analysis. Despite the well-recognized modulatory effects of citrate on hemostasis, the use of anticoagulated blood has clear analytical advantages, including repeat sampling and storage. However by altering the physiological state of the blood reproducibility and accuracy of the test is affected. Recent studies have shown the potential of a novel functional biomarker of clot formation: Fractal Dimension (df), that may give an improved diagnostic accuracy. In this study we assessed the potential of this new biomarker in scientifically measuring the effects of recalcification of citrated samples.Methods:35 healthy volunteers were included. Unadulterated and sodium citrate samples of blood were taken from each volunteer. Citrated samples were recalcified using (1M CaCl2). In the study we compared unadulterated whole blood dfresults tocitrated dfresults and repeated thecitrateddfexperiments 5 times for each sample over a 2 hour period to ascertain reproducibility.Results:Thedfof citrated blood was significantly lower than that of unadulterated blood (1.57±0.04 vs 1.69±0.04, p<0.001). The results of the citrate samples when tested 5 times over 2 hrs gave a coefficient of variation of 1.16%.Conclusions:For the first time we show that a functional biomarker of clot microstructure,df, can precisely quantify and measure accurately the direct effect that the addition of the anticoagulant sodium citrate has on whole blood clot microstructure. The study also shows that the test is reproducible and has potential utility as a biomarker of acute disease in the emergency setting in citrated blood.

The 2002 EAST guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prevention and antiXa monitoring after initiation of the medication or after adjusting doses in certain populations [1]. Studies have shown standard enoxaparin dosing of 30 mg every 12 hours may result in low antiXa levels [2]. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a pharmacist-lead protocol for adjusting enoxaparin dosing based on antiXa levels in trauma patients.Methods:This single center retrospective chart review included adult trauma patients admitted from 3/1/2018 to 9/20/2019. Per protocol, patients with body mass index (BMI) ≤40 kg/m2were initiated on enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily, and patients with BMI > 40 kg/m2were initiated on enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily. Peak antiXa levels were drawn 4 to 6 hours after at least the third dose of enoxaparin with a goal therapeutic range of 0.2-0.4 IU/mL. The primary objective was time in days to goal peak antiXa level. Secondary objectives include VTE occurrence, bleeding attributed to LMWH, and dosing regimens utilized. Subgroups were analyzed based on body mass index (BMI).Results:Of 511 patients identified, 375 patients met inclusion criteria. Median time to therapeutic antiXa level was 3 days (IQR 2-6). Of 337 patients with BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2, 319 patients (94.7%) were dosed initially per protocol and 153/319 patients (48.0%) met goal antiXa level at first check (Table 1). Of 38 patients with BMI > 40 kg/m2, 24 patients (63.1%) were dosed initially per protocol and 8/24 patients (33.3%) met goal antiXa level at first check.Conclusions:Our results indicate the protocol is safe due to lack of bleeding attributed to enoxaparin, but less than 50% of patients achieved goal antiXa level at first check. However, despite low rates of achieving goal antiXa level, VTE rates also remained low.References:1."

Studies on non ICU patients have shown that AFXa is below desired range for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention. In the ICU, many factors might influence AFXa levels including weight, creatinine clearance (CCT), shock and other medication. ATXa activity was not yet reported in a big mixed ICU population with variable morbidity. Our study hypothesis is that Enoxaparin is underdosed in most cases and routine AFXa activity should be monitored in all ICU patients.Methods:Preventive enoxaparin (40 mg qd) was given to all patients unless therapeutic dose was needed or contraindication existed. Levels of AFXa activity were taken 4 hours after the 3rddose. Therapeutic VTE preventive effect was defined as AFXa activity of 0.2-0.5. Patient data was collected from medical files.Results:The study is still ongoing, preliminary results were analyzed for 31 patients. 14 of 31 patients (45%) had AFXa activity below normal (subtherapeutic). Weight and CCT were negatively correlated with AFXa activity (Figure 1). Mean weight in the subtherapeutic AFXa was significantly higher than the therapeutic group (83.2 vs. 72.6 respectively, p=0.031). CCT in the subtherapeutic AFXa was significantly higher than the therapeutic group (95.1 vs. 60.4 respectively, p=0.003). The normal CCT group (>50) had significantly more patients with subtherapeutic AFXa (13 vs 8, p=0.017).Conclusions:In our ICU, 45% of the patients receive insufficient VTE prophylaxis. Overweight patients and patients with normal CCT should probably receive higher Enoxaprin dose. AFXa activity should be routinely monitored in ICU patients.Fig. 1 (abstract P329).Correlation of anti factor Xa activity with patient CCT and weight.

DVT requires oral anticoagulants to prevent progression to potentially fatal pulmonary embolism and recurrence. Therapeutic efficacy monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) including rivaroxaban is problematic as no reliable test is currently available. Advances in hemorheological techniques have created a functional coagulation biomarker at the gel point (GP) which allows quantitative assessment of: time to the gel point (TGP), fractal dimension (df) and elasticity (G’) [1, 2].Methods:The prospective observational cohort study measured TGP,df, G’, standard coagulation and cellular markers in first time DVT patients at three sample points: pre-treatment and approximately 20 and 60 days following 15mg BD and 20mg OD rivaroxaban respectively. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria applied.Results:40 DVT patients (mean age 64 years [SD±14.8]; 23 male, 17 female) and 177 non-DVT patients were well matched for age, gender and co-morbidities. Mean TGPon admission was 267s (SD±63.3s) and 262.9s (SD±73.5s) for DVT and Non-DVT respectively. DOAC therapy significantly increased TGPto 392.3s (SD±135.7s) after 20 days, and subsequently increased to 395.5s (SD±194.2s) at 60 days as shown in Table 1.df, G’ and standard hemostatic markers all remain within the normal range.Conclusions:TGPdemonstrates its utility in determining the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban. The significant difference in TGPbetween males and females needs further exploration. Localized stasis as a result of transient provoking factors appears not to generate a systemic strength enhancement in clot microstructure. Factors linked to increased clot strength in DVT patients include increased levels of hematocrit, fibrinogen, white cell count and male gender.References:1. Evans et al. Blood 116:3341–3346, 20102.

To better exploit the trauma care system, precise diagnosis of the injury site and prompt control of bleeding are essential. Here, we created a nursing protocol for initial medical care for trauma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of protocoled nursing care for trauma on measures of quality performance.Methods:This was a retrospective historical control study, consisted of consecutive severe trauma patients (Injury Severity Score >16). People were divided into two groups: protocoled group (from April 2017 to March 2019) and control group (from April 2014 to March 2017). We set the primary endpoint as mortality for bleeding. The secondary endpoints included time allotted from arrival to start of CT scan and surgery, administration rate of several drugs (sedations, painkillers, preoperative antibiotics, and tranexamic acid). For the statistical analysis, continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range) and were compared by Wilcoxon rank sum tests given a non-normal distribution of the data.Results:We included 152 patients in the study: 84 in the control group before the introduction of the protocol, 68 in the protocoled group. As a primary endpoint, the mortality for bleeding was similar between two groups (5% in the control group and 5% in the protocoled group). As a secondary endpoint, the time to CT initiation [Group A 11 (7-16) min vs Group B 7 (5-10) min; p <0.001], and emergency procedure [Group A 41 (33-56) min vs group B (29-43); p <0.001] were shortened by the protocol introduction. Furthermore, the administration rates of sedations, painkillers, preoperative antibiotics, and tranexamic acid were increased in the protocoled group compared with the control group.Conclusions:Although the mortality as a patient-oriented outcome was not affected, improved quality of medical care by nursing protocol introduction may be suggested in this analysis.P332 Long-term physical function and quality of life in patients with unstable pelvic ring fracturesN Saito1, T Seo2, H Iida2, H Matsumoto21Nippon Medical School Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Shock and Trauma Center, Inzai, Chiba, Pref, Japan;2Nippon Medical School Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Inzai, Chiba, Pref, JapanIntroduction:Unstable pelvic ring fracture (UPRF: AO-OTA type B, C) were life-threatening injuries, but with recent advances in acute resuscitation have focused attention on physical function and quality of life after"

We aimed to clarify the long-term physical functional and quality of life in patients with UPRF.Methods:This single-institutional prospective study included 72 patients with UPRF who were admitted to the trauma surgical intensive care unit (TSICU) and survived until discharge to home between 2012 and 2017. We evaluated the activities of daily living after the discharge using physical and mental component scores of SF-36® and defined physical dysfunction (PD) as physical function (PF-N) score of 40 or less. We divided the patients in the PD (n=34) and control (without PD, n=38) groups and compared the groups.Results:The patients had experienced blunt injuries, including falls (38%) and pedestrian injuries (33%). The mean age was 59.9 years (men: 65.3%); the median injury severity score was 22 (interquartile range: 13–29); and the mean length of TSICU stay was 3.3 days. The average period from the injury until the survey was 34.1 months. There was no difference between the PD group and the control group in the patient characteristics, fracture type, pelvic fixation, and complications. At the time of the survey, the PD group had significantly more painful complaints than the control group (PD: 67.6%, C: 23.6%, P <0.01), and had more physical and mental problems. The SF-36®subscale score showed a significant positive correlation between physical function and body pain, mental health respectively. The percentage of those who were able to return to work was not different in both groups (PD:26.5%, C:47.4%). In the multivariate analysis of PD, only age (odds ratio: 1.039, 95% CI: 1.00-1.07, P = 0.03) was relevant.Conclusions:Long-term PD was observed in 47% of patients with UPRF. The elderly were particularly prominent, and there was an association between pain and mental health.P333 Electrochemically induced change in the morphology of red blood cells – a new method for the diagnosis of critical conditionsA Evseev1, I Goroncharovskaya1, A Kuzovlev2, K Popugaev1, S Petrikov11N.V. Sklifosofsky research institute of emergency medicine, Moscow, Russia;2Federal research and clinical center of intensive care medicine and rehabilitology, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:The development of new methods for diagnosing critical states is one of the most important tasks. Patients in critical condition are characterized by a violation of many body functions, affecting the morphofunctional characteristics of blood cells. In case of red blood cells (RBC) this can lead to inhibition of oxygen transport function and development of hypoxia. Currently used methods for analyzing the state of RBC either do not have sufficient accuracy or require lengthy analysis and expensive equipment.

At the same time, with the stabilization of the patient's condition a restoration of the ability of RBC to change morphology was detected which in turn could have a positive effect on the rheological characteristics of the blood (Fig. 1).Conclusions:The results of the analysis of red blood cells using electrochemical changes in their morphology can be used as an additional method for the diagnosis of critical conditions.References:1.

Whole-body CT (WBCT) is widely accepted to improve the accuracy of detecting injuries. However, it remains the problem of time-consuming. Therefore, we focused on the scout image taken in advance of WBCT. Detecting major traumatic injuries from a single scout image would reduce the time to start treatment. A previous study suggested that even specialists could not easily find chest and pelvic injuries using WBCT scout image alone. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate deep neural network (DNN) models detecting pneumo/hemothorax and pelvic fracture from WBCT scouts.Methods:We retrospectively collected 2088 anonymous WBCT scouts together with their clinical reports at the Osaka General Medical Center between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017. We excluded incomplete, younger than 7 years old, postoperative, and poorly depicted images. The part of this dataset from January 1, 2017, until December 31, 2017, was used for validation and the rest for training DNN models.

The validation dataset for the former contained 258 images (54 years; 30%), and for the latter consisted of 186 images (55 years; 24%). The models achieved 59% accuracy and an AUC of 0.57 for detecting pneumo/hemothorax, 72% and 0.62 for pelvic fracture.Conclusions:Our results show that DNN models can potentially identify pneumo/hemothorax and pelvic fracture from WBCT scouts.

It can reduce staff workload and errors; help in monitoring quality of care; track staff’s compliance to care bundles; and provide data for research purpose. However, the transition from paper record format to electronic record involves changes in all kind of workflow in ICU. Therefore, an effective, efficient and evaluative rollout plan was required to minimize the risk that might arise from the new practice.Methods:Small groups training were provided. A working station with different case scenarios were set up for practices.Individual tutorials were conducted to clarify questions. Emphasis on patient care was always top priority.Contingency plans were available in case of server breakdown and power failure. Downtime drills were conducted to prepare the staff in emergency situations.Step-by-step transition from paper record to electronic format was gradually carried out. A plan was discussed among CIS team with clear dates and goals.New items in CIS were first reviewed and amended in team meeting until consensus was made; then were promulgated to all staffs during handover before implementation.Staff compliance and outcomes were then monitored; further review and amendment would be possible if necessary.Results:CIS roll-out plan was smooth. All staffs were able to integrate CIS into the daily routine. The contingency plans were well acknowledged. New items were followed as planned. Ongoing enhancement in CIS was put forward on nursing orders, handover summary, and integration with Inpatient Medication Order Entry (IPMOE) system.Conclusions:With emerging benefits CIS brings along, our staff has more time to devote to direct patient care. Human input in data interpretation and clinical judgment on top of CIS play an irreplaceable role in patient care.P336 Reducing unnecessary laboratory testing in an intensive"

Although common, this strategy is not supported, since more than 50% of the exams requested with this rationale may be within the normal range [1]. Misconduct based on misleading results, anemia, delirium and unnecessary increase in costs may happen [2]. We have developed a strategy to reduce laboratory tests without clinical rationale.Methods:Observational retrospective study, from July 2018 to June 2019. The number and type of laboratory orders requested, the epidemiological profile of hospitalized patients, the use of advanced supports, the average length of ICU stay and the impact in outcomes such as mortality and hospital discharge at a private tertiary general hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro / RJ - Brazil were analyzed.Results:A strategy was implemented to reduce the request for exams considered unnecessary. Approximately 1,300 patients underwent ICU during this period. The epidemiological profile and severity of patients admitted to the unit were similar to those observed historically. There was a significant reduction (> 50%) in the request for laboratory tests and there was no negative impact on outcomes such as mortality, mean length of stay and no greater use of invasive resources. Over the period evaluated, the estimated savings from reducing the need for unnecessary exams were approximately $ 150,000 per year.Conclusions:The rational use of resources in the ICU should be increasingly prioritized and the request for routine laboratory tests reviewed. A strategy that avoids such waste, when properly implemented, enables proper care, reducing costs and ensuring quality without compromising safety.References:1. Peixoto AA Jr et al.

Feeding through an incorrectly placed NG tube is a 'Never Event,' associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Analysis of these incidents reveal that the misinterpretation of chest radiographs, by medical staff, who had not received competency-based training, is the most frequent cause [2].e-Learning has revolutionized the delivery of medical education [3], however, there are barriers to its use [4]. We hypothesized that, by taking e-Learning content, and delivering it face-to-face, we would improve training rates, and thus patient safety.Methods:A questionnaire was completed by 50 critical care doctors, concerning their knowledge of the existence of the e-learning module, whether they had completed formal training in NG tube placement, and how confident they were, on confirming correct positioning, using a 5 point Likert scale. All clinicians underwent training in the interpretation of NG placement, using chest radiographs. After the session they were asked to re-appraise how confident they felt. Results were compared using paired t tests.Results:Confidence improved in all, rising from a pre-test average score of 3.74 (SD=0.92), to post-session 4.76 (SD=0.48), p=<0.0001.

After the session, 100% were aware of the guidelines, and 100% had completed the training (Figure 1).Conclusions:e-Learning is a useful tool, but has its limitations. By using course content, delivered with more traditional learning methods, we improved the number of appropriately trained clinicians, and thus the safe use of NG tubes in our unit.References:1.

A total of 44087 patients were identified with AF, of which 17.8-49.4 % of patients received anticoagulation. The incidence of thromboembolic events ranged from 0-1.4 % in the anticoagulated population and 0-1.3 % in the non-anticoagulated population. Major bleeding events were reported in 3 studies and occurred in 8.6 % of each of the anticoagulated populations. Major bleeding events occurred in 0-7.1 % in the non-anticoagulated groups. 30-day mortality in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) was 22.9 % (21.3-24.6) and 30.6 % (28.9-32.4) for untreated patients. Annual mortality was 35.4 % (33.5-37.3) with VKA treatment and 46.3 % (44.4-48.3) without.Conclusions:Only 4 studies contained analysable data. Anticoagulated patients had a lower mortality at 30 days and 365 days post admission to critical care, however there was an increased incidence of major bleeding events compared to the non-anticoagulated population. Thromboembolic events were comparable in both cohorts. Data from current literature is scarce and inferences regarding the effectiveness of anticoagulation in patients in critical care with AF requires further investigation and research.P343 A review of handovers on the intensive care unitEJ Jones1, DH Hepburn21Cardiff University, Medical School, Cardiff, United Kingdom;2Royal Gwent Hospital, Intensive Care Medicine, Newport, United KingdomIntroduction:Every new admission to the ICU prompts a handover from the referring department to the ICU staff. This step in the patient pathway provides an opportunity for information to be lost and for patient care to be compromised. Mortality rates in Intensive Care have fallen over the last twenty years, however, 20% of patients admitted to an ICU will die during their admission [1]. Communication errors contribute to approximately two-thirds of notable clinical incidents; over half of these are related to a handover [2]. NICE have concluded that structured handovers can result in reduced mortality, reduced length of hospital stay and improvements in senior Clinical Staff and Nurse satisfaction [3].Methods:A checklist was created to review the information shared and to score the handover. This checklist was created with Doctors and Nurses and is relevant for handovers between all staff members. Information was gathered prospectively by directly observing 17 handovers on the ICU.Results:There is a notable discrepancy in the quality of handovers of new patients (Figure 1). This is true of handovers between Doctors, Nurses and a combination of the two. It is also true of all staff grades.

We studied prevalence and contributing risk factors using and analysing the outcomes of the 2 self-scoring questionnaires. Analysis was performed using descriptive statistical analysis.Results:There were 90 respondents, 36% scored the threshold for depressive symptoms on the CES-D depression scale. Interestingly, 40% (CI 25.4-57.7%) of those meeting the score for depressive symptoms identified as having frequent restless sleep compared with 11% (4.6-21.8 %) from those not meeting. Gender did not affect depressive symptoms 35% of females and 37% of males met the threshold. With the MBI-hss for exhaustion the mean was 17.16 (SD 4.6) which is a high level of exhaustion, the second variable cynicism the mean score was 14.08 (SD 4.2), which was considered high. The final variable was emotional exhaustion the mean was 25.16 (SD 9.90), this is considered moderate levels of emotional exhaustion.Conclusions:There was high prevalence of burnout in ICU in all different categories as well as depressive symptoms.

WHO reports that the noise level in hospitals should not exceed 35 dB at daylight and 30 dB at night. The aim of this study is to evaluate the noise levels in intensive care unit, to apply awareness training to intensive care staff in terms of noise and to compare the noise levels before and after education.Methods:Noise measurement areas are separated into 17 points including 12 patient bedsides, nurse desk, staff desk, wareroom, corridor and entrance of intensive care unite. Measurements were performed 14 times per day. After 10 day, awareness training were given to staff in terms of harmful effects of noise. After the training, noise measurements were repeated during 10 days. After total 20 days the measurements were terminated. Noise was measured with incubator analyzer (FLUKE model: Bio-tek serial no:6050274).Results:The mean noise values before and after the training were not statistically different from the mean average noise values (p>0.05). When the time of measurement were compared, the noise levels were higher between 10-16 hours to other measurements before and after the training statistically (p=0.001).

Despite significant resource limitation low income countries carry a huge burden of critical illness. Available data is insufficient to clearly show the burden and outcomes of intensive care units in these developing countries [1]. The objective of our study is to evaluate the morbidity and outcomes of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary university hospital in Hawassa, Ethiopia.Methods:This was a prospective observational study. Data was registered and analysed starting from patient admission to discharge during a 12 month period beginning September 2018. Data regarding demographics, sources of admission, diagnosis, length-of-stay and outcomes were analysed.Results:The total number of patients admitted to the ICU was 218, with 71 patients dying over a one year period. The highest admission was from emergency medical unit, 36% and the lowest source was from pediatrics department, 8%. Out of these, 69.8% were males. The mean age was 27 years (2-62). The most frequent aetiologies of morbidity in the admitted patients were traumatic brain injury (24.6%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (22.9%) and seizure disorder (8%). Average median length of stay was 3.0 days (interquartile range: 1.0 - 27.0). The overall mortality rate was 32.5%. The top four causes of death in the ICU were respiratory illness at 24% followed by sepsis with multiorgan failure at 20%, trauma (16%) and central nervous system infection (12%).Conclusions:Infection morbidity and mortality remains very high and needs institution of aggressive preventive strategies. The increase in frequency of trauma patients need to receive due attention. Sepsis causes a high number of deaths, though overtaken by respiratory illnesses.

However, while increased admission of older patients (>80 years) to ICU has been observed in Australia and some European countries, decline observed elsewhere may indicate rationing according to chronological age. This effect was explored for Wales, a nation with historically low numbers of ICU beds (5.9 per 100,000), by analysing ICU admissions over a 10-year period.Methods:Welsh adult ICU episodes 2008-17 were examined via the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, Swansea University. Modified Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (MCCI) was calculated using ICD-10 codes. Electronic Frailty Index (eFI) was calculated using an algorithm based upon primary care events. Patients categorized according to age as follows: 18-64 (youngest), 64-79 (older) and 80 (oldest) years and over.Results:85, 629 ICU episodes were identified. Number and proportion of older and oldest patients did not change significantly over the period. However, ICU admissions per 10,000 population fell from 93.9 to 81.4 and from 90.0 to 78.4 in the oldest and older cohorts, and increased from 21.7 to 22.2 in the youngest cohort. Across all age patients, there was a significant increase in admissions with moderate comorbidity (p=0.025) and a decrease in those with high comorbidity (p=0.022). There were no significant trends in organ support, whether overall or within age cohorts. A significant decrease in ICU mortality (from 23.5% to 20.5%, p=0.028) and hospital mortality (from 36.6% to 33.4%, p=0.017) were observed in the oldest cohort, though not 1-year mortality; this trend was not observed in other age cohorts (Table 1).Conclusions:Contrasting with previous reports, decreased admissions per unit population in older and oldest age groups, and those with high comorbidity, suggest resource constraints may have influenced admission discussion and"

Discharge time seems to be associated with in-hospital prognosis, but meta-analyses have not shown a difference in weekday compared to weekend discharge [2,3]. However, papers that examined discharge ‘into’ out-of-hours days, particularly on Fridays, have found differences [3]. Our aim was to assess whether discharge from ICU ‘into’ out-of-hours (OOH - weekends and public holidays) is associated with in-hospital mortality or re-admission to ICU, and whether these patients were seen on the wards OOH by medical staff.Methods:All adults discharged from the general ICU to a ward at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in December 2016-18 were included. In-hospital mortality rates were assessed for each day, with ‘into weekdays’ defined as Sunday to Thursday and ‘into OOH’ Friday, Saturday and the day before a public holiday. A subset of patients with data on readmission rate to ICU was also examined. All available notes from patients discharged into OOH in 2018 were reviewed.Results:The study included 1732 patients with a subset of 443 with readmission data. 117 sets of notes were reviewed from patients discharged into OOH (Figure 1). The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients discharged into OOH (5.1% vs 7.6%, P=0.012). Within the subset, OOH was associated with in-hospital mortality or readmission to ICU (6.8% vs 11.9%, P=0.044), though readmission rate alone was not (1.7% vs 2%, P=0.35). Of patients discharged into OOH, once on a ward 64% were reviewed by a specialty doctor but 20.5% were not seen.Conclusions:This is the first study to examine ICU discharge 'into' OOH days including public holidays. We found increased hospital mortality in OOH, similar to other studies [3]. Up to a fifth of high-risk ICU stepdown patients were not reviewed by a doctor on OOH days.References:1. Beck DH et al.

Invitation letters were sent to the entitled 2 months after death and those who actively responded were involved in an encounter with a multidisciplinary group including a clinical psychologist, two nurses and two cultural anthropologists with expertise in OP. Psychological profile and satisfaction with care was assessed with validated tools, while the experiences of organ donation (OD) request and traumatic memories were measured with close and open ended questions.Results:90 envelopes were sent to the entitled of 79 DBD and 11 DCD. Responders were 29, 31.0% were FM of DCD. Reasons not to participate were logistical problems, linguistic barriers, dissatisfaction with care, lack of interest, perceived excessive burden. Of all FM, 18 (62.1%) were female, mean age 54.9 (DS 15.7). Encounters included from 1 to 4 FM; 11 were spouse (37.9%), 10 (34.5%) sons, 4 (13.8%) parents, 4 (13.8%) other relatives. 28 FM were Italian, 1 from USA; 28 consented to OD, only one refused. Three FM completed 12 months evaluation.Conclusions:The study is ongoing. The enrollment of not consenting FM was a relevant obstacle to the collection of data that could help to better understand FR.

Understanding the experiences and related memories of potential donors’ family members (FM) in a follow up clinic is crucial to identify the most relevant factors affecting OP and the associated outcomes. Our aims were to describe the effects of all phases of OP on the psycho-social wellbeing of FM, and then to gain insight into the possible causes of family refusals to organ donation (OD).Methods:Mixed-method study involving FM at 3 and 12 months after patients’ death. Psychological profile was evaluated with validated tools: PWBS (psychological well-being scale), STAI-Y (state trait anxiety inventory – form Y), BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory - II), IES-R (Impact of Event Scale – Revised), ICG (Inventory of Complicated Grief). Traumatic memories were assessed with a 4-point scale. Satisfaction with care was measured with FS-ICU (family-satisfaction ICU). Content analysis was based on audio-taped semi-structured interviews.Results:29 FM were enrolled; 18 (62.1%) were female, mean age 54.9 (DS 15.7); 11 were spouse (37.9%), 10 (34.5%) sons, 4 (13.8%) parents, 4 (13.8%) other relatives. All FM but one were Italian, 96.5% consented to OD. DBD and DCD processes were analyzed. Quality of Life’s more affected dimensions were personal growth and autonomy; mean values of BDI-II (10.2), IES-R (25.2) and ICG (21.7) were below the clinical cut-off. FM showed slight symptoms of anxiety. Traumatic memories were more frequent and intense in relation with the very early stages of the process (out-of-hospital rescuing/emergency department) and with the communication of bad prognosis and death (Figure 1). Satisfaction with care was fair good.Conclusions:Preliminary data suggests that the early stages of OP and the communication of bad news deserve attention.

Patients demographic data, preoperative variables, intraoperative variables, postoperative stay and complications, causes,incidence and outcomes of ICU readmission were recorded. Readmission is defined as ICU readmission within ≤ 3 months after initial ICU discharge.The primary endpoints were the incidence and causes of ICU readmission and secondary endpoint was one year survival.Results:A detailed review of 335 patients was made, 26 patients ( 7,76%) were readmitted, 4 patients ( 1.19 % of total patients), ( 15.3% of readmitted patients) were readmitted twice due to mesothelioma, sepsis, CVS and graft failure.Out of 26 readmitted patients, 11 patients ( 42.3 %) were discharged and 15 ( 57.7%) died and 25 % of twice readmitted patients discharged and 75 % died. The main causes of death were renal failure, hematemesis, sepsis, CVS, pulmonary complications, vascular complications and graft failure.Conclusions:Causes of ICU readmission post LDLT were variables, may be related to preoperative comorbidities, surgical complications, immunosuppression, sepsis and other causes. Readmission carries a greater risk of bad outcome.

Globally transplantation programs struggle with increasing organ shortage. Patients (pts) with MOV are a potential source for procurement. However, outcome data after kidney transplantation (KTX) from such donors are sparse.Methods:We retrospectively studied the cadaveric KTX at the Charité Berlin in 2018 and identified donors with ongoing organ replacement procedures.

One donor needed a veno-venous ECMO due to ARDS, and 1 donor had a LVAD implanted due to cardiac failure. The donor age was 41 ± 10.5 years (yrs). In addition, 6 donors had at least one cardiac risk factor. The kidney donor risk index averaged 0.94 (SD ± 0.14) and S-creatinine prior to KTX was 2.41 (SD ± 1.27). The recipients were 49.2 (SD ± 8.2) yrs of age and cumulated an average waiting time of 7.7 ± 2.9 yrs. Delayed graft function (DGF - dialysis within the first 7 days after KTX) occurred in 91% of patients (pts) (vs. 43.7% DGF in the overall 2018 cohort). All pts gained renal function at a median of 7 (IQR 5.25-9) days (100% vs. 96.3% 2018 cohort). Mean S-creatinine 12 months post-transplant was 1.30 ± 0.45 mg/dL resembling an estimated GFR of 58.86 ± 17.9 mL/min/1.73m2. One pt died unexpectedly 44 days after KTX with a functioning graft.Conclusions:The results of organs from donors with MOV in the first year after KTX were excellent. Especially the young donor age together with a targeted benefit-risk assessment enables the usage of such organs.Fig. 1 (abstract 359).Graft function in the first year post-transplantP360 Apheresis or not apheresis in controlled liver donation after circulatory death: a single centre experience in ItalyC Dallai1, S Baroni2, A Marudi2, S Ghedini1, M Talamonti1, S Rinaldi2, G Melegari2, E Bertellini21Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Anestesia, Rianimazione e Terapia Intensiva e del dolore, Modena, Italy;2Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Modena, Departement of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Modena, ItalyIntroduction:One way to expand the potential donor pool is Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD), and a strategy to reduce the complications related to the ischemic time is the use of Normothermic Regional Perfusion (NRP) with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) [1,2].We compare the use of standard NRP with an effective adsorption system inflammatory mediators (CytoSorb®) in the regional normothermic reperfusion phase via regional ECMO, that involves a reduction in cellular oxidative damage, assessed as a reduction in levels of proinflammatory substances.Methods:We report a case series of 9 DCD-Maastricht IIIA category donors, treated in ECMO with NRP, to maintain circulation before organ retrieval, in association with CytoSorb® in 5 patients.

This condition is the most common cause of death in postsurgical ICUs. Nowadays, there are different ICU scoring systems for predicting the likelihood of mortality, such as APACHE or SOFA. Nevertheless, they are used rarely because they also depend on the reliability and predictions of physicians. In these sense, gene expression signatures can be used to evaluate the survival of patients with postsurgical shock.Methods:mRNA levels in the discovery cohort were evaluated by microarray to select the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups of those that survived and did not survive 30 days after their operation. Selected DEGs were evaluated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) for the validation cohort to determine the reliability of the expression data and compare their predictive capacity to that of established risk scales.Results:IL1R2,CD177,RETN, andOLFM4genes were upregulated in the non-survival group of the discovery cohort. Further confirmation of the predictive power of these genes was found in the validation cohort. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) were 0.653 (0.535–0.771), 0.669 (0.544–0.794), 0.739 (0.628–0.850) and 0.782 (0.682–0.877) for IL1R2, CD177, RETN, and OLFM4, respectively. These values were more instructive than the classical mortality risk scores from the APACHE (0.647; 0.543–0.751) and SOFA (0.580; 0.456–0.705). Finally, a regression model was performed including gene expression values and different adjust variables, improving the AUC value up to 0.800 (0.693–0.906).Conclusions:This study offered new"

The 90-day mortality rate of individual medical conditions are also compared. The burden of comorbid illness and frailty is increasing in the critical care patient population [1]. Outcomes from septic shock in patients with chronic ill-health is poorly understood.Methods:Patients admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham ICU between April 2016 and July 2019 with a diagnosis of septic shock (Sepsis 3.0) were included. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and performance status (PS) were calculated. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Categorical variables are presented as percentage and analysed using a chi squared test. Continuous variables are presented as median (IQR) and analysed using a Mann-Whitney test. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was conducted with CCI and PS, using age, APACHE II score, initial lactate, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein as other covariates. A Hosmer-Lemeshow test of >0.05 indicated good fit.Results:846 patients were admitted with septic shock. Patients were 61% male, with a median age of 60 (48-73). 35% had a hemato-oncological malignancy and 90-day mortality was 43% (Table 1). Patients who died had a higher CCI (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [1-4]; p = 0.03) and higher PS (2 [1-3] vs. 1 [0-2]; p = 0.02) than survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that CCI (OR 1.46 [1.24-1.71]; p <0.0001) and PS (OR 1.65 [1.17-2.35]; p = 0.005) were independently associated with mortality in septic shock.Conclusions:Comorbid illness and frailty are both independently associated with mortality from septic shock. Hematological and metastatic solid organ malignancies were the medical conditions associated with the highest mortality.References:1. Haas B et al.

The aim of our study is to assess factors associated with hospital mortality in interstitial lung disease patients admitted in the intensive care unit and to investigate the long-term outcome of these patients.Methods:We performed a retrospective study in an intensive care unit of teaching hospital highly specialized in interstitial lung disease management between 2000 and 2014.Results:A total of 196 interstitial lung disease patients were admitted in the intensive care unit during the study period. Overall hospital mortality was 55%. Two years after intensive care unit admission, 70/196 patients were still alive (36%). One hundred eight patients (55%) required invasive mechanical ventilation of whom 80% died in the hospital (Figure 1). Acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease was associated with hospital mortality (OR=5.4 [1.9-15.5]), especially in case of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Multiorgan failure (invasive mechanical ventilation with vasopressor infusion and/or renal replacement therapy) was associated with very high hospital mortality (64/66; 97%).Conclusions:Survival after intensive care unit stay of patients with interstitial lung disease is good enough for not denying them from invasive mechanical ventilation, except in case of acute exacerbation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. If urgent lung transplantation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are ruled out, multiorgan failure should lead to consider withholding or withdrawal life support therapies.Fig. 1 (abstract P363).Hospital Mortality of ILD patients in ICU without ECMO according to organ support therapiesP364 Acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) as a predictor of malnutrition and 1-year mortality in intensive care unit (ICU).

The WGAP of ESICM proposed a grading system for AGI. Four grades of severity were identified: AGI grade I, a self-limiting condition; AGI grade II (GI dysfunction), interventions are required to restore GI function; AGI grade III (GI failure); AGI grade IV, GI failure that is immediately life threatening. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of using AGI grades I and II as predictors of malnutrition and 1-year mortality in critically ill patientsMethods:Single-center retrospective cohort study in a tertiary university hospital (2015 – 2017). AGI Grade III and IV patients were excluded. Αnthropometric data, GI symptoms (vomiting,diarrhea), feeding intolerance, gastric residual volumes and abdominal hypertension were recorded. Daily prescribed caloric intake was calculated using a standard protocol and daily achievement of caloric intake was recorded. mNutric score was calculated for all patients. A score ≤5 was used to diagnose malnutrition.Results:200 patients (59% men, mean age 65 years) that stayed in the ICU for >48 hours were included in the study. 52% were at high nutritional risk. 1-year mortality was 31%. The prevalence of AGI II was 14%. Age, gender, BMI, mortality and energy intake did not differ significantly between patients with AGI II and those with AGI I (Table 1). Logistic regression corrected for gender and age revealed that AGI II (OR: 2.91; 95%CI 1.01-8.40) was independent predictor of malnutrition.Conclusions:The AGI grading system seems useful in identifying GI dysfunction and could be used as a predictor of impaired outcomes. In this study, AGI II patients were prone to develop malnutrition with a prevalence of 14%.

Research ethics committee approval from the Mater Misercordiae University Hospital (MMUH). Inclusion criteria - ≥ 80 years of age and acute admission to ICU from May to July 2018. Data collected on 20 consecutive patients. Frailty and activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed using the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (KATZ).Results:CSF pre-admission frailty was present in 60% of patients, increasing to 93% at 6 months (Figure 1). 74% of survivors at 6-months had a CFS score increase by ≥ 1 point. Pre-frail and frail CFS patients suffered an average 2-point deterioration in their Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). 60% of KATZ patients were fully functional pre-admission, deteriorating to 13% at 6 months. 74% of patients declined by 1 ADL at 6 months. 60% of the deceased were deemed fully functional initially.Conclusions:We demonstrate an association between an ICU admission event and enduring functional decline at 6 months. ICU admission resulted in patients acquiring on average 1.5 new IADL limitations despite their initial CFS. This is echoed in a study by Iwasyna et al. who also showed similar deteriorations in IADL and cognitive impairment [2]. KATZ benefits may be best used in describing functional decline. 74% of patients developed at least one new limitation. However, the CFS takes into account IADL’s and thus may be more sensitive in predicting the functional outcomes of an ICU event at 6 months.References:1. Guidet B et al.

On one adult ICU weekly mortality meetings are used for this purpose and aid multidisciplinary reflections on individual patient deaths. However, such reviews run the risk of being subjective and fail to acknowledge themes which may relate to preceding or subsequent deaths. This paper describes a new mortality review process in which: a) reviews are structured using the Structured Judgement Review (SJR) framework [2]; and b) themes are generated over an extended period of time to create longitudinal learning from death.Methods:The SJR framework has been developed by NHS improvement for the new medical examiner role, looking at inpatient deaths. We adapted this to better suit the ICU creating a novel review structure. This involves explicit judgement comments being recorded, and the use of a scoring system to analyse the quality of care during the patient’s stay with a focus on elements of care delivered on the ICU. Tabulation of this information allows analysis over time, identifying trends across all patients, and in specific subgroups.Results:This framework has been rolled out at the St George's Cardiothoracic ICU weekly"

Recent studies have shown that variables relevant for the prediction of adverse events are present in the electronic patient records [1]. In this study, we evaluated three distinct machine-learning methods for predicting possible patient deterioration after surgery.Methods:The data was collected retrospectively from the Catharina hospital in Eindhoven. This dataset contained all the surgeries conducted in the hospital from 2013 up to 2017. The variables in this dataset were tested on their ability to differentiate between patients with a normal recovery versus patients with an unplanned ICU admission after being admitted to the ward. The dataset contained 44 variables related to either the preoperative screening, surgery or recovery room. All variables were tested for statistical significance using a univariate logistic regression (LR), from which a subset of 34 statistically significant (p<0.05) variables was created. These variables were used to train three different types of models, namely, the LR, support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian network (BN). The network structure of the BN was designed using expert knowledge and the probabilities were inferred using the data.Results:The three models were validated using five-fold cross-validation, resulting in the following areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.82(0.79-0.86) for LR, 0.82(0.78-0.88) for SVM and 0.65(0.63-0.68) for BN (Fig. 1).Conclusions:The results indicate that machine learning is a promising tool for early prediction"

Department of Intensive Care, Ghent, Belgium;4Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Department of Intensive Care, Rotterdam, NetherlandsIntroduction:Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission decisions of patients with a malignancy can be difficult as clinicians have concerns about unfavourable outcomes, such as mortality [1]. A diagnosis of a malignancy is associated with an almost 6-fold increased likelihood of refusal of ICU admission [1]. Recent large long-term mortality studies of patients with a malignancy admitted to the ICU are scarce. Therefore, our aim was to compare mortality of patients with either a hematological or a solid malignancy to the general ICU population, all with an unplanned ICU admission.Methods:All adult patients registered in a National Intensive Care Evaluation registry with an unplanned ICU admission from 2008 to 2017 were included. Subsequently, we divided these patients into 3 cohorts: Cohort 1 (all patients with a hematological malignancy), cohort 2 (all patients with a solid malignancy), and cohort 3 (a general ICU population without malignancy). As primary outcome, we used 1-year mortality, and as secondary outcome, ICU and hospital mortality.Results:We included 10,401 (2.2 %) patients in cohort 1, 35,920 (7.6%) patients in cohort 2 and 423,984 (90.2%) in cohort 3 (Table 1). The 1-year mortality of patients of cohort 1, 2, and 3 was 60.1%, 46.2% and 28.3%, respectively (p<0.001). Age, comorbidities, organ failure, and type of admission (i.e. surgical or medical) were positively associated with 1-year mortality in all cohorts (p <0.05).Conclusions:One-year mortality is higher in both patients with a hematological malignancy and patients with a solid malignancy compared to the general ICU population. In addition, several factors were positively associated with 1-year mortality, i.e., age, comorbidities, medical ICU admission,"

Despite that, the only study retrospectively reviewing drug abusers in the ICU demonstrated less infections and better outcomes. We compared matched patient populations in order to fully understand whether drug abuse is a risk factor for infection and a predictor of poorer prognosis as is perceived by most physicians. We hypothesized that the drug abusers admitted to the ICU will fare as good as or better than non-abuser ICU patient populations.Methods:This is a prospective study done between the years 2010-2012 on the entire patient population of the Detroit Medical Center. After the drug abuse population was identified, controls were matched according to age and admission ICU units. Patients charts were reviewed and data regarding baseline demographics, infectious complication and outcome was extracted.Results:Data was retrospectively collected for 323 drug abusers and 305 matched controls. Comorbidities and hospital admission diagnosis were significantly different between the two groups. Disease severity scores were significantly higher in the drug abuser’s patient group (DAPG) on admission and during the ICU stay. DAPG had significantly more organ failure: more need for ventilation (30.5% vs 46.4% in the DAPG (p<0.001)), more ARDS (1% vs 3.7%, p=0.03), more renal failure (33% vs 45.5%, p=0.002) and more need for renal replacement therapy (6.6% vs 11.2%, p<0.05) .They had longer hospital length of stay (LOS). There was no difference in ICU or hospital mortality. Multivariable modeling did not find drug abuse to be an independent risk factor for hospital mortality, ICU mortality (Hosp: OR = 1.37,P= 0.3397; ICU: OR=1.43,PP= 0.07), but was a risk factor for a longer hospital LOS (ME=1.46,P< 0.0001).Conclusions:Drug abuse is not an independent"

Having a clear plan in place reduces anxiety and eases decision making for both patients and clinicians particularly at time when patient loses their capacity to participate in the decision making.Methods:This retrospective audit looked at patients in Neuro and Cardiac ICU with a 7 day stay or longer between 1/7/19 – 20/08/19. This specific length of stay is due to both units having planned admissions with a one night stay and not suitable for audit. Local database ‘Ward Watcher’ which records patient stay in ICU was used to find suitable patients. Electronic medical records were then accessed via ‘iCLIP’ to view if discharge summaries included a TEP.Results:Between 1/7/19 to 20/08/19 in Cardiac ICU 24 patients who fitted the audit criteria were identified. 10/24 (41.6%) had a TEP in place. In Neuro ICU 15 patients were found and 12 (80%) had a TEP. The combined result is 22 patients out of 39 (56%) had escalation plans in place. Few TEP were specific to what treatment would be suitable in a case of deterioration i.e fluids, non-invasive ventilation, etc.Conclusions:This is a small audit which although it did not include general ICU still reflects the need for encouraging clinicians and patients to speak freely regarding escalation plans. Medical decsions is clinician led however this audit was carried by nursing staff as we have a duty to be advocate for our patients involvement in medical care [2].References:1. Sayma M et al.

On the other hand, there are several scales for this purpose that are used in other clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate whether the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP), Karnofsky (KPS) and Daily Living Activity Independence Scale (Katz Scale) can predict mortality in acutely ill medical patients.Methods:This prospective cohort study was conducted in a Medical Intensive Care Unit of a University Hospital. In six months, 114 patients were included. In addition to the above, the scales used were: Sequential Organ Failure (SOFA), Simplified Acute Physiology Scores III (SAPS III) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). Information on functional capacity prior to the acute illness that led to hospitalization was obtained through an interview with family members. The Research Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas approved this study.Results:The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that for each point added in PaP, there was a greater chance of 37.8% for mortality (OR: 1.378; CI: 1.108 - 1.714; p= .0124).

Complexity in the decision-making is a challenge. The aim of the present study are: To describe clinical decision making in emergency situations in different ethical scenarios that include the end of life; to analyze the influence that has the experience and the different perspectives of the healthcare professionals in the decision-making in critical situations.Methods:Cross sectional study design with closed-ended questionnaire including with four clinical cases with four answer choices describing clinical decisions among those that had to choose only one at the discretion of the participant. The health care professionals surveyed were emergency physicians, intensive care physicians, emergency nursers, Intensive Care nurses, medical residents, medicine students and master in Bioethics. This last group was chosen because of its experience and specific training in the field of bioethics as a control group or reference.Results:A total of 444 respondents participated in the study. 22.2% were emergency physicians, 14.8% intensivists, 11.2% emergency nursing, 6.2% ICU nursing, 24.9% resident doctors, 13.8% medical students and 6.9% other professions.

Norway is an affluent, equality-based Northern European society with a public health care system. Legal frames and national guidelines on limitations of life-sustaining treatment exist. Four per cent of Norwegians dies within an ICU.Methods:An a priori post-hoc analysis of 11 Norwegian sites participating in ETHICUS II - a prospective, observational study including all consecutive ICU patients who died or had limitations of life-sustaining treatment from September 2015 to February 2016 [1].Results:Of 3298 admitted ICU patients 450 (14%) died or had limitations. Patients’ mean age was 69 years (16-96) and 90% had a chronic disease in addition to the acute condition that brought them to the ICU. Eleven per cent were assessed mentally competent. Eighty-eight per cent had limitations, 35% in the form of a sequence - decisions at multiple time points. Mutually exclusive E-o-L categories were; 33% withholding, 55% withdrawing, 0% shortening of the dying process, 4 % brain deaths, 8% failed CPR. Primary reasons behind decisions are in Table 1. E-o-L discussions were initiated in 1% by the patient, in 2% by family, in 3% by nurses and in 94% by physicians. In 57% nurses participated in discussions. In 35% physicians asked for or received information about patients’ preferences, only 2 patients had Advance Directives. Time from admittance to first limitation was 38h (25-75 percentile 6 – 133 h), from first limitation to death 21h (25-75 percentile 4-69 h). Major difficulties or disagreements occurred in 7%.

None of the respondents thought that their own religious beliefs played any part in decision making.Fear of criticism:Among the less experienced respondents there was a clear sense of fear of making a questionable assessment of the patient’s medical prognosis. There was a fear for criticism from colleagues that were not directly involved in the decision-making, and may have made another decision. This created a wish among younger respondents to defer or avoid participating in decision-making.Conclusions:Physician-related, individual variability in EoL decisions primarily consisted of differing views on acceptable outcome, values and fear of criticism.Table 1 (abstract P378).Physician-related individual variability in end-of-life decisionsThemeCodesQuotesIndividual variabilityViews on acceptable outcomes“Will this patient really leave the hospital alive, and in that case, in what condition will the patient be?” (R 1)Individual variabilityValues“I am trying to actively think about not treating marginalized people in any other way than others.

The most common disease states were pneumonia (32.2%) and UTI (31.0%). Overall, 1703 (13.9%) patients died prior to hospital discharge. The mean SOFA score for the cohort was 5.4 ​(95%CI: 5.3-5.4). Patients with peritonitis had the highest mean SOFA score (6.7, 95%CI: 6.3-7.0) and patients with cellulitis had the lowest mean SOFA score (4.7, 95%CI: 4.5-5.0). SOFA score discrimination was highest among patients with endocarditis [area under the curve (AUC) 0.79, 95%CI: 0.69-0.90] and lowest for patients with isolated bacteremia (AUC 0.59, 95%CI: 0.49-0.70). Within each quartile of SOFA score, mortality was highest in patients with pneumonia and peritonitis and lowest in patients with cellulitis (see Figure 1). The addition of disease state to SOFA for the prediction of in-hospital mortality improved model discrimination (AUC 0.69, 95%CI: 0.68-0.70 vs. 0.71, 95%CI: 0.70-0.73, p<0.01).Conclusions:Site of infection is an important consideration when interpreting the SOFA score.

In developing Sepsis-3, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was chosen for its prognostic value and relative ease of implementation clinically [2]. We propose an update based on epidemiologic data from two intensive care databases that more effectively captures organ dysfunction in the context of Sepsis-3.Methods:Using the MIMIC-III (exploration) and e-ICU (validation) databases, we extracted patients with suspicion of infection to form the study cohort. The predictive power of each SOFA component was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) for in-hospital mortality. A logistic model with the LASSO penalty was used to find an alternative statistically optimal score.Results:By utilising alternate markers of organ dysfunction (e.g. lactate, pH, urea nitrogen) we demonstrated a significant improvement in AUC for several versions of the new score, SOFA2.0 (Figure 1).Conclusions:The SOFA score can be updated to reflect current advances in clinical practice.

However, 5% of non-hematologic and 15% of hematologic cancer pts will need admission to intensive care unit (ICU). IPOP-SCI-2017/01 is a prospective cohort study designed to ascertain the cumulative incidence of AOF in adult cancer pts.Methods:Single centre prospective cohort study with consecutive sampling of adult cancer pts admitted for unscheduled inpatient care while on, or up to 8 weeks after, systemic cancer treatment. Primary endpoint was AOF as defined by quick SOFA. Six months accrual expected an accrual of 400 pts to infera population risk AOF with a standard error of 1%.Results:Between 08/2018 and 02/2019 10392 pts were on systemic anticancer treatment, 358 had unscheduled inpatient care and were eligible for inclusion and 285 were included. Median age was 64 years, 51% were male, 52% had adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) &gt; 3 and hematologic cancers accounted for 22% of pts. The cumulative risk of AOF on hospital admission was 35% (95%CI: 31-39); and of AOF during hospital stay was 40% (95%CI: 35-44). AOF was associated with older age, CCI &gt; 3,hematologic malignancy, shorter median time from diagnosis and &gt; 1 prior line of therapy. On admission, 62% of pts were considered not eligible for artificial organ replacement therapy (noAORT) and 34% of pts who developed AOF while inhospital were judged noAORT. Overall, 17 (15%) of AOF pts wereadmitted to ICU, 31.5% for AORT. Median follow up 9.5 months (min 6; max 12). Inpatient mortalitywas 18%, with ICU mortality rate of 59%, with median cohort survival 4.5 months (95%CI: 3.5-5.4). On multivariate analysis, AOF was an independent poor prognostic factor (HR 1.6; 95%CI 1.2-2.1).Conclusions:Risk of AOF in cancer pts admitted for unscheduled inpatient care while on systemictreatment is 35%, and risk of ICU is 15%.

Parameters included septic shock, human immunodeficiency virus with CD4<200/mm3, renal dysfunction, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2) <200mmHg, diffuse parenchymal infiltrates and no TB treatment on admission. The aim of this study was to validate and refine the severity-of-illness score in patients with tuberculosis requiring intensive care.Methods:We performed a prospective observational study with a plannedpost-hocretrospective analysis,enrolling all adult patients with confirmed TB admitted to the medical intensive care unit from 1 February 2015 to 31 July 2018. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were performed on dichotomous categorical variables, and t-tests on continuous data. Patients were categorized as hospital survivors or non-survivors. The 6-point score and the refined 4-point score were calculated from data obtained on ICU admission.Results:Forty-one of 78 patients (52.6%) died. The 6-point scores of non-survivors were higher (3.5+/-1.3 vs 2.7+/-1.2; p=0.01). A score ≥3 vs. <3 was associated with increased mortality (64.0% vs. 32.1%; OR 3.75; 95%CI, 1.25-10.01; p=0.01)(Table 1).Post-hoc, a PaO2:FiO2<200mmHg and no TB treatment on admission failed to predict mortality whereas any immunosuppression did. A revised 4-point score (septic shock, any immunosuppression, acute kidney injury and lack of lobar consolidation) demonstrated higher scores in non-survivors (2.8+/-1.1 vs. 1.6+/-1.1; p<0.001).

We evaluated the long-term evolution of ICU survivors by identifying the real burden of prolonged critical illness on survival, quality of life and hospital readmissions.Methods:We conducted a prospective cohort in 16 Brazilian hospitals including 1616 ICU survivors with an ICU stay > 72h. We compared the patients diagnosed with chronic critical illness with the other patients. Telephone Follow-up at 3 and 6 months. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12 questionnaire.Results:It was observed that 38% of patients had some definition of chronic critical illness. Chronic critically ill patients had higher mortality at 6 months (p=0.012). This difference is mainly due to higher intrahospital mortality (p=0.0001). Mortality after hospital discharge was similar between groups. There was no difference in hospital readmission rate at 6 months. Regarding quality of life, patients had similar values in both mental and physical domains.Conclusions:Chronic critically ill patients have a shorter survival when compared to patients with ICU stay greater than 72h.

We compared outcomes for high-risk patients between low and higher volume units.Methods:Audit data from Irish ICUs is analysed and reported by the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) in London. ICNARC report risk-adjusted mortality rates in all patients and in low-risk patients(predicted mortality rate <20%) for each Unit, using the ICNARCH-2015 model to predict the risk of death. We used this data to calculate the proportion of high-risk patients(predicted mortality >20%) in each Unit, the mortality rate for high-risk patients, the risk-adjusted mortality rate and we compared the overall risk-adjusted mortality between low and high volume units.Results:The median number of annual new-patient admissions among 18 participating Units was 390; units below this were defined as low-volume and those above as high-volume Units. The proportion of all admissions to each Unit who were high-risk ranged from 8% to 54%(mean 34%). Unit mortality rates for high-risk patients ranged from 33% to 69%. The ratio of observed to expected mortality(Standardized Mortality Ratio - SMR) for high risk admissions in each Unit ranged from 0.87 to 1.34(mean 1.07). In Fig. 1 Units are ordered 1 to 18 on the x axis according to increasing volume of admissions i.e. Unit 1 was smallest and Unit 18 largest. There was no definite relationship between volume of patients admitted to a Unit and SMR in high risk admissions. Larger units had more variability in SMR. The overall SMR for all high-risk patients in all low-volume Units was 1.07 versus 1.03 for all patients in all high-volume Units.Conclusions:There was no difference in mortality for high-risk patients between high-volume and low-volume Units.References:1.

Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) describes emerging or worsening physical, cognitive or mental dysfunctions, arising after severe illness and persisting for a long time following hospital discharge, interfering with patients’ quality of life.Methods:In this prospective study we evaluated cognitive ability and mental health status in ICU survivors one year after hospital discharge. Eligible patients were 18-70 years old, requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 3 days. Patients completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The maximum MMSE score is 30 points. A score of 20-24 suggests mild dysfunction, 13-20 moderate disability, and <12 severe dysfunction. Patients also completed the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Scores ≥16 indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. Finally, the State-Trail Inventory (STAI), comprised of two separate scales for measuring state (S) or trait (T) anxiety, was also completed. A cut-off of 40 detects clinically significant symptoms. Questionnaires were completed in the presence of an experienced psychologist.Results:Forty-one (23 F) ICU survivors with a mean age of 43±16 years were studied. They consisted of medical (n=17), trauma (n=15), surgical (n=8), or burn (n=1) patients. Median ICU stay was 12 (IQR: 4-66) days. MMSE score was 28±3; in 5 patients (12%) MMSE score was ≤ 24. CES-D was 17±12; 18 patients (44%) had high scores. Mean S-anxiety scale was 50±8; 39 patients (95%) had high scores. Mean T-anxiety scale was 44±6.Conclusions:One year after hospital discharge, ICU survivors exhibit symptoms consistent with PICS, involving primarily mental health, with anxiety and/or depression being prominent. Cognitive ability seems to be less commonly affected. It remains yet unclear whether interventions can ameliorate functional capacity in ICU survivors.P389 The predictive value of phase angle on 6 month survival after ICU admissionF Stellingwerf, M Koopmans, H Buter, EC BoermaMedical Center Leeuwarden, Intensive Care, Leeuwarden, NetherlandsIntroduction:Phase angle, derived from bioimpedance analysis (BIA), reflects tissue quality and quantity in which cell mass, membrane integrity and hydration state are represented.

This is also seen in even outside ICU and proposed to be called post-acute-care syndrome (PACS), especially in elderly patients. In patients with infection, SOFA score is famous for predicting in-hospital mortality, but there are no tools for predicting ADL weakening during admission. To search for risk factors for ADL weakening during admission other than the age, we conducted a retrospective observational study.Methods:The subjects were surviving patients with infection, aged from 16 to 89 who were admitted to our department from April 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019. Information of basic characteristics, laboratory data on admission and adjunctive therapies were extracted from our database. We use Barthel Index (BI) as ADL evaluation, and the BI at discharge were evaluated by nurses. We stratified patients by BI at discharge of over 60 or not, and investigated factors that predicted it. We compared each factor between 2 groups, and perform a logistic regression analysis with those that had a significant effect clinically or statistically.Results:There were total 2170 patients and 515 had infection. The number of surviving patients were 397. Average age was 73.18, female was 41.6% and median SOFA was 4. BI was over 60 in 192 patients. Factors which had significant difference between 2 groups were age, existence of DIC and laboratory data on admission such as ALB, BUN, FDP, TAT, soluble fibrinmonomer complex and thrombomodulin. There was no relationship between ADL weakening during admission and ICU admission.

Drivers for unplanned readmission include pre-ICU functional status as well as the social circumstances which a patient returns to [2]. At present, there is limited understanding of the impact of cognitive function and whether this plays a part in the readmission process. The aim of this study was to undertake cognitive screening during the readmission episode to understand if ongoing cognitive impairment was still present in this patient group.Methods:Ethical approval was granted from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (approval number 19/WS/0091). We used a single centre cohort study design. Using a clinical database, we identified those patients who had an ICU admission ≥ 3 days who were readmitted to acute care within 90 days of hospital discharge. The researcher attended the ward and after discussion with the current direct care team and screened patients using the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) tool [3].Results:The cut-off scores were: 24-30- have normal cognition; 19-2- mild cognitive impairment; 10-18- moderate impairment and ≤ 9 severe impairment. Baseline demographics of this cohort are shown in Figure 1. 11 patients were screened during a readmission to acute care. 8 patients were found to have normal cognition (72.7%). 23.3% of patients had some degree of cognitive impairment: 2 (18.2%) had mild cognitive impairment and 1(9.1%) had moderate impairment.Conclusions:In conclusion, patients discharged from ICU have continuing cognitive impairment.

Ethical approval was granted from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (19/WS/0091). A grounded theory approach was used to explore from a patient and caregiver perspective what the drivers for readmission are [2].

Theoretical sampling was undertaken.Results:15 participants were interviewed.10(66.6%) were patients and 5 (33.3%) were caregivers. The themes that have emerged from the data were: Pain and polypharmacy; lack of social support and/or isolation; strained relationships with primary care providers and information provision across the patient journey. Subsequent theory development is underway to understand how this learning could help reduce readmissions in future.Conclusions:In conclusion, both social and biomedical drivers are likely to contribute to acute care readmission in this group.

Discrimination and predictive ability of the tools for hospital mortality, 1-year mortality, hospital readmission and adverse events were compared using concordance statistic (C-statistic) and calibration plot adjusting for age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and ICU admission source, respectively.Results:The cohort included 421 patients. Prevalence of frailty was 32.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.3%–37.5%) with the CFS and 39.2% (95% CI 34.5%–44.0%) with the mFI. Concordance between the two tools was low [(ICC of 0.37; 95% CI 0.29-0.45) and partial correlation coefficient of 0.38 (95% CI 0.29-0.47)], even after adjustment. Hospital and 1-year mortality were greater for frail compared to non-frail patients using of both tools. Similarly, both tools found frail patients were less likely to be living independently after hospital discharge, and more likely to be rehospitalized when compared to non-frail patients.Conclusions:While the CFS and mFI show low concordance, both showed good discrimination and predictive validity for hospital mortality. Both tools identify a subgroup of patients more likely to have worse clinical outcomes.P394 Impact of a post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) prevention bundle in critically ill patients at ICU discharge and follow-upLA Costa hirai, CR Dos Santos, F De Souza Trindade Neto, VF Silva de Araújo, A Da Luz Leitão, W Sousa Montenegro, KT Passos Nishiwaki, M Martins Silva, JR Araújo de AzevedoSão Domingos Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, São Luís, BrazilIntroduction:The Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) is a myriad of physical, psychiatric and cognitive disorders secondary to critical illness, leading to a decreased quality of life and an important socioeconomic burden. This study aimed to identify if the conformity to a PICS Prevention Bundle was able to reduce the incidence of the syndrome at ICU discharge.Methods:All patients admitted to the ICU from January 1stto December 31st2018 were included. The conformity to each of the ten components of the PICS Prevention Bundle was assessed daily, and the patients were evaluated for anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, muscular weakness, mobility impairment and nutritional risk at ICU discharge and at a 3-to-6-months follow-up consultation. The patient cohort was divided in terciles according to bundle conformity for the analysis.Results:From the 1145 enrolled patients, 352 (31%) were evaluated at ICU discharge, and 103 (29%) attended to the follow-up consultation. There was no difference in baseline characteristics between the cohorts. There was no correlation between the prevalence of PICS at discharge"

Multifaceted causes make it difficult to treat and understand [1]. Not many studies have explored sleep deprivation beyond ICU. This is evidenced by findings from a recent systematic review [2] which included 8 studies with only one study [3] reporting sleep deprivation beyond ICU. The aim of this paper is to present findings of sleep deprivation beyond ICU from a larger study that examined the experience of critical illness in ICU and beyond in the context of daily sedation interruption.Methods:Hermeneutic phenomenology was used to conduct the study. 12 participants aged 18 years and above who fulfilled the enrolment criteria were enrolled into the study. The cohort comprised 7 male and 5 female participants. In-depth face to face interviews at two weeks after discharge were conducted and repeated at six to eleven months. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and thematically analysed. Significant statements were highlighted and categorized for emergent themes.Results:Six participants continued to experience sleep deprivation up to eleven months after ICU. Two cited dreams about ICU, three could not explain why they continued to fail to sleep and one stated that he continued hearing ICU alarms in the silence of the night.Conclusions:Sleep deprivation continues beyond ICU due to nightmares, delusional memories and unexplained reasons. Further research is needed to establish causes of sleep deprivation and explore ways to promote sleep in critical illness survivors after ICU discharge.References:1.Mannion H et al."

Intensive Care Syndrome:Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) is a multidisciplinary complex intervention designed to address PICS [2]. With a paucity of evidence on PICS after cardiothoracic intensive care, we aim to evaluate PICS and the feasibility of the InS:PIRE intervention in this population.Methods:Those attending the clinic received 5 weeks of intervention including individual appointments with ICM nurse, physician, pharmacist, and physiotherapist. A café area facilitated peer support alongside psychology group sessions. Primary outcome was quality of life measured by EQ-5D-5L. Further surveys included: pain, mental health, and self-efficacy. Questionnaires were taken at baseline, 3 and 12 months.Results:Over 5 cohorts, 27 patients attended, 67% male, median age 66 years (IQR 61–75), median APACHE 2 score of 17 (IQR 14-18.5), and median ICU length of stay was 13 days (IQR 9-21). A total of 14 (53%) patients completed surveys at one year. Scheduled admissions represented 56% of those attending. Mean EuroQol EQ-VAS score was 70/100 (SD +/- 18) at baseline increasing to 78/100 (SD +/- 16) by 1 year (Table 1). Those with problems in at least one domain of EQ-5D-5L fell from 92% at baseline to 73% at 1-year with the breakdown shown in table 1. Severe problems were seen in 22% falling to 18% at 1 year. HADS demonstrated an anxiety or depression rate of 44%. Brief pain inventory identified 14 patients (52%) with ongoing chronic pain. Mean self-efficacy was 32/40 (SD +/-6) at baseline and 34/40 (SD +/-5) at 1 year.Conclusions:Cardiothoracic intensive care patients have ongoing and persistent features of PICS with significant effects on health-related quality of life. Further, the InS:PIRE multi-professional complex intervention is feasible within this specialist group.References:1. Needham DM et al. Crit Care Med 40:502-9, 20122. McPeake J et al.

Frail patients now account for an increasing proportion of hospital and critical care admissions [1]. We aimed to compare frailty and mortality in our intensive care unit.Methods:Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) was incorporated within the electronic health record (EHR) 2019. We performed this retrospective analysis on the data collected between Jan’19 and Oct’19. The predictor and outcome for this study were frailty and hospital mortality respectively. All demographic data, acute physiology score, critical care and hospital outcome data were automatically collected in the EHR and recorded. We used a cut off of CFS>3 and above to define non-frail and frail respectively. Chi-squared test, simple and multiple logistic regression were used. Adjustment was done for ICNARC score and age.Results:Total number of patients was 848, of which 140 (16.5%) died in hospital. Within the patients<65 years (n=392), 79 (20%) were recorded as frail or vulnerable. The number of elective and emergency admission were 292(34%) and 556(66%) respectively. In the frail and non-frail, mortality rates were 30% and 9.5% (p<0.001) respectively, with odds ratio of 4.14 (95% CI 2.8, 6; p<0.001) (Table 1). For emergency patients, mortality in the frail and non-frail were 36.3% and 16.5% respectively (p<0.001), with odds ratio 2.9 (95% CI 1.9, 4.3; p<0.001) but after adjustment, it was not significant [OR 1.64 (95% CI 0.97, 1.77); p=0.06]. For patients, who were discharged from critical care, mortality in the frail and non-frail were 11.8% and 1.2% respectively (p<0.001) with odds ratio 11.8 (95% CI 4.6, 27.9; p<0.001) and adjusted OR 4.19 (95% CI 4.16, 11.1; p=0.06).Conclusions:Frailty is a risk factor for hospital mortality for critical care survivors, independent of age. It is possible that enhanced targeted resource allocation and appropriate placement for these patients could alter adverse outcome.References:1) Flatten H et al.

In recent years, frailty in CC prognostication has been of interest, with meta-analysis correlating worsening outcomes with increasing frailty [1]. In this study, we compared the effect of frailty versus age for determining hospital survival for critically ill patients.Methods:This study was conducted in a UK District General Hospital, with 19 CC beds, where the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) is collected on all adult admissions. Retrospective analysis of data, adjusted for ICNARC score was performed on CC emergency admissions using STATA 14, combining CFS, patient demographics and outcome data from our electronic records. Logistic regression was used for mortality prediction. We defined non-frail as CFS<4. An age cut-off of 70 years was used for the age adjusted model, as remaining life expectancy (RLE) at age 70 years has recently been shown to be equal to RLE at age 65 years before [2].Results:Total number of patients was 556 (male- 58%) of which 140 (16.5%) died in hospital. Importantly, in the patients <70 years (n=529), 137(48%) had CFS<4. The number of elective and emergency admission were 292(34%) and 556(66%) respectively. The risk for mortality (OR) in the adjusted model with age and CFS cut off were 2.65 (1.61, 4.35) and 2.35 (1.44, 2.83) respectively. Both of these mortality prediction models, one incorporating age cut-off 70 and the other based on CFS, show equal performance of discrimination (AUROC 0.88) (Figure 1).Conclusions:Our data supports an association between increasing CFS and mortality for the CC population independent of age. Frailty should be incorporated in clinical decision making in addition to utilisation of arbitrary cut offs of age.References:1. Muscedere J et al. Intensive Care Med 43:1105-1122, 20172.

Through a follow-up study after hospital discharge [1], we assessed the impact of critical care on the psychological symptoms, functional outcomes and quality of life of patientsMethods:We conducted a prospective cohort in 16 Brazilian hospitals including 1616 survivors of an ICU stay > 72h. We compared chronic critically ill patients (ICU stay> 10 days) and the other patients. We performed psychological and functional presential assessment in patients within 48 hours of ICU discharge and by telephone at 3 and 6 months.Results:The prevalence of chronic critically ill patients was 26%. Regarding outcomes, chronic critically ill patients had a higher incidence of depressive symptoms than other patients in the immediate post-ICU discharge (p = 0.004), as well as a higher incidence of muscle weakness (p <0.001). However, in subsequent evaluations, we found no difference between groups regarding psychological symptoms - depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Higher functional dependence was observed in critically ill patients, but without difference in the quality of life score, both in the physical (p = 0.87) and mental (p = 0.84) domains.Conclusions:Chronic critically ill patients, when compared to patients with stay> 72h, have a higher incidence of depressive symptoms at ICU discharge. This difference disappears in the follow up. Chronic critically ill patients present higher levels of functional dependence but without repercussions on quality of life scores.References:1.

Of those patients 2,387 (43%) were alive one year after CA. We plotted WBC against baseline risk of death and through graphic examination of a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (lowess) curve found the lowest risk of death to be associated with a WBC of 12 (E9/l) (Figure 1). We used this value as a cut-off point and ran separate multivariable regression analyses, accounting for baseline risk, for patients with a WBC over or under 12. For those with a WBC under 12, an increasing WBC was associated with a reduced risk of death (OR 0.969, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.940–0.999). For those with a WBC over 12, an increasing WBC was associated with an increased risk of death (OR 1.018, 95% CI 1.004–1.034).Conclusions:A WBC deviating from 12 E9/l is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in probability of death in CA patients. Mortality increases with both high and low WBCs. The lowest mortality was observed at WBC 12 which is higher than healthy population reference value (WBC 3.4 -8.2), suggesting that moderate leukocytosis after CA may not be harmful.Fig. 1 (abstract P400).Association of white blood cell count with predicted mortalityP401 Risk factors for dysphagia in ICU patients following invasive mechanical ventilationP Zuercher, NV Schenk, C Moret, D Berger, R Abegglen, JC SchefoldUniversity Hospital Bern, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Bern, SwitzerlandIntroduction:Dysphagia is common and independently predicts death in ICU patients. Risk factors for dysphagia are largely unknown with sparse data available only from mostly small cohorts without systematic dysphagia screening. We investigated risk factors for dysphagia in ICU patients post invasive mechanical ventilation.Methods:Post-hoc analysis of data from a large monocentric prospective observational study (“Dysphagia in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, DYnAMICS” [1]) using comprehensive statistical models to identify potential risk factors for dysphagia in 933 primary ICU admissions. In DYnAMICS, patients were systematically screened for dysphagia at the bedside within 3 hours from extubation using the two-step Bernese ICU Dysphagia Algorithm. Screening-positivity was followed within 24 hours by a confirmatory exam, identifying 116 ICU patients suffering from dysphagia.Results:After adjustment for typical confounders, baseline neurological disease (OR 4.45, 95%-CI: 2.74-7.24, p<0.01), emergency admission (OR 2.04, 95%-CI: 1.15-3.59, p<0.01), days on mechanical ventilation (OR 1.19, 95%-CI: 1.06-1.34, p<0.01), days on renal replacement therapy (OR 1.1, 95%-CI: 1-1.23, p=0.03), and disease severity (APACHE II score within first 24 hours; OR 1.03, 95%-CI: 0.99-1.07, p<0.01) remained independent risk factors for dysphagia post mechanical ventilation (Figure 1).

However data on mobilization practices on ICU patients are inadequate. The aim of this study was to document physiotherapy intervention practices on ICU Cardiac Surgery patients at the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center.Methods:For this study, of the 221 patients that were subjected to cardiothoracic surgery, 159 were assessed for the effects of early mobilization on the duration of ICU hospitalization. Physiotherapy intervention was recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU admission.Results:Physiotherapy practice consisted of respiratory physiotherapy and mobilization interventions such as active and passive limb mobilization, sitting in bed and transferring from bed to chair. The proportion of patients mobilized, was 18% (Ν=29/159) within 24 hours from ICU admission, 53% (Ν=46/87) in day 3, 54% (Ν=22/41) in day 5 and 62% (N= 15/24) in day 7. The duration of stay in the ICU was reduced in patients who were mobilized compared to bedridden, (28 ± 37 vs 66 ± 92 hours, p = 0.001).Conclusions:Early mobilization rates of patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery appear reduced in the ICU Cardiac Surgery compared to international literature. Physiotherapy interventions practices are associated with decreased ICU length of stay.P406 Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in tracheoventilated home patientsF Righetti1, E Colombaroli21Intensive Care Unit, Fracastoro Hospital, Emergency Department, San Bonifacio, Verona, Italy;2Intensive Care Unit, Fracastoro Hospital, San Bonifacio, Verona, ItalyIntroduction:The purpose of our retrospective study is to compare 2 groups (patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - ALS- or neurological disease and patients non neurological disease) of tracheoventilated patients in a considered period to highlight differences in ICU recovery for VAP [1] and mortality, due to VAP or other causes - ex. acute renal failure or cardiac diseases.Methods:24 tracheostomized adult patients, cuffed cannulae, 24 hours of home ventilation, cannula change every 60 days at home, in the period 2015-2019, classified in 2 groups (group A: patients with ALS or neurological diseases - 62.5% - and group B: patients without neurological diseases ex. pulmonary diseases - 37.5%).

The exact pathogenetic mechanisms of HO are unknown. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) induce bone formation, while signaling through the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) regulates osteoclast formation, activation and survival in normal bone modeling and remodeling. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) protects bone from excessive bone loss by preventing RANKL from binding to RANK. In the present study we investigated these molecules as possible biomarkers of HO development in ICU patients.Methods:We measured the levels of BMP-2, RANKL and OPG on ICU admission, and thereafter on days 7 and 30 in the sera of 28 critically ill patients using ELISA.Results:Nine of the 28 patients developed HO in the ICU or during the 30-day follow-up period. Our results showed that on admission to the ICU, the patients who developed HO had significantly lower BMP-2 levels compared to patients who didn’t [566.7 (216.7-883.3) pg/ml vs. 1300 (566.7-2817) pg/ml, respectively, p= 0.037]. RANKL levels were also decreased in the HO patients on admission [1.495 (0.285-2.465) ng/ml vs. 2.465 (1.535-6.67) ng/ml, p= 0.048], while OPG levels were similar in both groups. In the HO patients, on day 7, the levels of BMP-2 were slightly elevated, whereas on day 30 they tended to increase (p= 0.064). The patients who did not develop HO had stably elevated levels during the 30 days. A small elevation was noted in RANKL levels in the HO patients, while OPG levels remained unaltered at all time points, for both groups.Conclusions:In our cohort of critically ill patients, those who will develop heterotropic ossification have significantly decreased levels of BMP-2 and RANKL on admission, suggesting that these molecules may be used as"

This project focused on the handover of patients between ICU and the general wards in a district general hospital where there was no formal handover system in place. A baseline survey found 100% of foundation year 1 (FY1) doctors felt medications were unclear when rewriting ICU drug charts from the electronic notes. Junior doctors were often unaware patients had been transferred. This resulted in significant delays in drug charts being rewritten and missed or delayed medications. Our aim was to reduce the median time delay in drug charts being rewritten by 50% in 4 months.Methods:Following discussion with ICU staff, ward staff and FY1 doctors, a formal standardized handover system was introduced. This involved a verbal handover to the appropriate FY1 by an ICU doctor and the patient drug chart to be rewritten in ICU at the time of handover. The next change was to display posters on the wards to alert staff that the medical team are to be contacted when a patient comes to the ward from ICU and to ensure the drug chart is completed.Results:The baseline data showed a median time delay of 4 hours, with one patient waiting 14 hours for a drug chart. Following the interventions the median time delay has decreased to 0 hours within 4 months as demonstrated in Figure 1. The changes have received positive feedback from ICU staff, ward staff and FY1 doctors.Conclusions:The aim of reducing the time delay by 50% has been achieved with the median time delay now 0 hours. This has improved patient safety by significantly reduced delays in medications and through the introduction of a standardized handover. This has also provided an opportunity for junior doctors on the wards to seek clarification regarding medications and the clinical management plan for the patient. This has established a communication channel between ICU and the wards making patient care safer and more effective.Fig. 1 (abstract P408).Run chart showing time delay in rewriting ICU drug chart in patients being discharged from ICUP409 E-health outside the ICU: a wearable in telemonitoring respiratory and heart rates as part of the Early Warning ScoreEJ Van lieshout1, J Hoekstra2, R Voorn3, E Maij4, M Regeling4, I Bruining5, R Lo51Amsterdam University Medical Center, Intensive Care and Mobile Intensive Care Unit, Amsterdam, Netherlands;2Amsterdam University Medical Center, dept. of Hematology, Amsterdam, Netherlands;3Amsterdam University Medical Center, Dept. of medical engineering, Amsterdam, Netherlands;4Amsterdam University Medical Center, Dept. of EPIC"

But with innovative wearables measuring respiratory and heart rate wirelessly, culture on intrahospital telemonitoring should definitely change. However, culture has been known to be one of the most crucial success factors in innovation, especially in health care. Human design thinking is a promising tool in health care innovation but rarely used in a multidisciplinary team to initiate an innovation culture and stimulate sustainable collaboration. The aim of this study was to initiate a pilot project with a multidisciplinary team to start using wearables for Early Warning Score (EWS) on a clinical ward.Methods:Human Design Thinking was used to write a value proposition on wearables in clinically admitted neutropenic hematologic patients in an academic center. A multidisciplinary team was performed to cover all disciplines involved in the technical, clinical and administrative parts of the project. A vendor was chosen based on its product specifications in relation to the present hospital monitoring infrastructure. In design thinking sessions, critical appraisal of multiple telemonitoring factors was performed by sub teams and a Canvas projectplan was constructed.Results:The project team was formed of registered nurses, physicians, IT-specialists, Electronic Health Record consultants; a critical care physician was appointed as project leader. The main critical factors were:unseamlessly transmitting of both heart and respiratory rates including appropriate movements filtering to the nurse's smartphonesdirect uploading into electronic health record with automated EWS calculationnurse driven protocol on EWS follow up.Philips Healthcare with their IntelliVue Guardian wearable biosensor was the chosen vendor (Figure 1).Conclusions:Design thinking in a multidisciplinary health care team could positively influence the innovation culture.

The objective of this study was to compare the quantity and quality of antimicrobial use among CCRT patients during three identified stages of their management; before CCRT activation, during and on day four after CCRT activation [1].Methods:Two hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were utilized for this study. Tertiary care hospitals serve over 750,000. Include 1300-beds, 15 different intensive care units, and 50-inpatient wards. All patients above 15 years and managed by the CCRT during the study period were eligible to be included in the study. Case-control design was used to compare septic (cases) and non-septic (controls) CCRT patients, recruited prospectively for five months (January to May 2018).Results:A total of 315 CCRT patients were included: 157 with sepsis (cases) and 158 without sepsis (controls). Average age was 61.1 ± 20.4 years and 54.6% of the patients were males. Among the 157 septic patients, 97 (61.8%) had a defined septic focus with pneumonia the main diagnosis (33.6%). 60 (38.2%) had no defined septic focus. The most frequent triggers for CCRT activation were changes in respiratory rates (29.5%). An antimicrobial was used during CCRT activation in 96.2% of cases and 65.2% of controls (p < 0.001). Meropenem (51.4%), vancomycin (41.3%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (28.6%) were the most frequently used antimicrobials. More cases were likely to be admitted to ICU than controls (43.9% versus 28.5%, p=0.004). There were no differences in the development of antimicrobial adverse events (31.8% versus 27.2%, p = 0.270) or in mortality (4.5% versus 1.3%, p = 0.104) between cases and controls.Conclusions:The fact of no de-escalation of antimicrobials were noticed in majority of CCRT patients; this led to the importance of establishing an antimicrobial stewardship hospital wide program.References :1.

Point of care testing for influenza is available and has demonstrated accuracy [1,2], the current gap in knowledge is the question around the opportunity cost of influenza testing. If POCT is financially a less costly test this could free up scarce resource.Methods:The study adopts a cost minimisation approach. The point of care test is the Roche Cobas® Liat® machine which can detect flu A/B and is compared with the West of Scotland Specialist Virology centre’s established in house multiplex real time PCR assay.The model was developed using Microsoft Excel and has 2 arms comparing analysis of the above mentioned tests.Results:The model estimates that the total cost of POCT per patient tested is £3926.33 compared with £4053.92 for lab testing (Figure 1). This is a saving of £127.60 per patient when POCT is used. The result swings in favour of the lab test when POCT specificity falls to 95.72%. If the lab could provide the result of influenza testing within 12 hours the result would swing in favour of lab testing. Zanamivir which will potentially be used increasingly in the intensive care setting can more than double the difference between the 2 tests in favour of POCT.Conclusions:This research suggests that POCT offers potential cost savings in the ICU setting. This is the case as long as POCT specificity is higher than a threshold of 97.52% and the lab take longer that 12 hours to return the result. The sensitivity analysis should allow for external validity given the usual variations in ICU practice.References:1. Binnicker MJ et al. J Clin Microbiol 53:2353-4, 20152. Merckx J et al.

Non-cellular deoxyribonucleic acid actively participates in regulation of properties of biofilms. Thus, in biofilms transfer of genetic information including genes responsible for sensitivity to antibacterial drugs occurs much more often than in single-living bacterial cells. However, despite the involvement of extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid in adhesive processes and intercellular interactions, its role has not been fully understood.Methods:238 isolates isolated from sputum and pharynx of 175 patients during 2016-2019 were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: the 1st group of 139 people (79,4%) had severe respiratory infections, the 2nd of 36 people (20,6%) - respiratory infections of moderate severity.Results:A method was developed for determining percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid in microbial community using 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride.

By implementing ePlex analysis when the department of clinical microbiology is closed, the test can be optimally used in terms of clinical impact and costs.Methods:Prospective ePlex testing on consecutive non-duplicate positive blood cultures, primarily from the emergency room, incubated at a satellite incubator at the 24h/7day open department of Clinical Chemistry. The routine bio-medical analysts performed the analyses. The result, except findings of CoNS, was made available to the attending physician. Cultures were transferred to the Department of Clinical Microbiology for conventional diagnostics the next day. The ePlex results were compared to conventional diagnostics for pathogen identification and time to result. The clinical impact was assessed by investigation of the patients´medical records.Results:Forty-four cultures were analyzed with ePlex (Figure 1). Complete agreement with conventional diagnostics was observed in 38/44 cases. No false-positive results were observed, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100% respectively for target pathogens. Time to result was, on average, 10.4 h faster with ePlex compared to conventional diagnostics. Antimicrobial therapy could have been optimized in 5 patients based on the ePlex result, but treatment was only changed in one case (E.coli CTX-M+) receiving meropenem 8.5 h before the antibiogram was available.Conclusions:The ePlex blood culture panels provide high accuracy and significantly faster results. The current implementation offers substantial potential value at a minimal cost, and is a feasible approach to 24-h/7 days blood culture diagnostics in many hospital settings.

Continued surveillance and finding a suitable drug is of central priority. This study examinesKlebsiella pneumoniaeand other nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit of Aseer Central Hospital, determines their antibiogram, and evaluates predictors of mortality.Methods:The present investigation was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on data collected from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Aseer Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia (2018-2019). Demographic, microbiologic, antimicrobial treatment and outcomes were collected from 150 patients with bacteremia, pneumonia, and other infections. A total of 150 patients were included (2018, n= 68; 2019, n= 82). Identification of isolates andin vitrosusceptibilities were done by Vitek 2 system. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and regression models.Results:One hundred and fifty patients were included in our study (51 females and 99 males). The clinical specimens were mainly derived from respiratory (60.0%), followed by blood (16.7%), urine (11.3%), wound and skin swab (4.7%), CSF (2.7%), pus, discharge and swab (2.7%), and abdominal fluid and aspirate ((2.7%).

There are more people living with HIV in South Africa than any other country in the world. This study aimed to describe the patterns of presentation as well as determine factors that influences mortality in HIV infected patients at an ICU facility in Johannesburg.Methods:Consecutive medical records of 204 HIV infected individuals admitted to the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital adult ICU during 2017 were reviewed. Data was described and subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Of the 903 total admissions during the period analysed, 204 (22.6%) were HIV infected. Ninety-five (46.6%) patients were admitted for sepsis related illnesses, 69 (33.8%) for post-operative care and 40 (19.6%) for non-sepsis related illnesses. HIV infected patients had a median length of ICU stay of 5 (2-9) days and ICU mortality of 33.3% (n=68). On multivariate analysis of significant parameters identified from the univariate analysis, requirement for inotropes/vasopressors (p=0.009), mechanical ventilation (p=0.037) and a non-sepsis related diagnosis (p=0.030) were associated with an increase in ICU mortality. The Risk Adjusted Mortality Ratio (RAMR – observed ICU mortality rate/ APAHCE II predicted ICU mortality rate) was 0.51, which indicates that the APACHE II score overestimated ICU mortality in HIV infected patients by approximately two-fold.Conclusions:Inotrope/vasopressor administration, mechanical ventilation and a non-sepsis related diagnosis is significantly associated with mortality in HIV infected patients in the ICU. The APACHE II score overestimates mortality in HIV infected ICU patients.P421 Impact of beta-lactamase detection reagent on rapid diagnosis of ESBL-producing pathogens using urine samples in patients with gram-negative bacteriuriaJ Yoshimura1, Y Ooi2, Y Umemura1, K Yamakawa1, S Fujimi11Osaka General Medical Center, Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Osaka, Japan;2Osaka General Medical Center, Department of Clinical Laboratory, Osaka, JapanIntroduction:The rapid increase of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing pathogens worldwide makes it difficult to choose appropriate antibiotics in patients with Gram-negative bacterial infection. Cica-beta reagent (KANTO CHEMICAL, Tokyo, Japan) is a chromogenic test to detect beta-lactamases such as ESBL from bacterial colonies. The purpose of the study was to reveal whether Cica-beta reagent could detect ESBL-producing pathogens directly from urine rather than bacterial colonies to make a rapid bedside diagnosis of the antibiotic susceptibility of Gram-negative pathogens.Methods:We conducted a prospective observational study from July 2019 to October 2019.

Because it could provide immediate information about ESBL, it might be a point-of-care test to predict causative pathogens and guide appropriate antibiotics in patients with UTI.P422 Effect of bundle approach on preventing hospital-acquisition of drug-resistant pathogens in intensive care unitsA Ota1, M Kawanami1, J Yoshimura2, Y Umemura2, K Yamakawa2, S Fujimi21Osaka General Medical Center, Nursing Department, Osaka, Japan;2Osaka General Medical Center, Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Osaka, JapanIntroduction:The increasing emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens all over the world has become catastrophic world health problems. In fact, we experienced an uncontrollable outbreak of multidrug-resistant pathogens and ICU closure for 3 weeks in January 2013. Based on the experience, we built an infection control bundle including contact precautions for every patient in the ICU, carrying personal alcohol-based hand rubs, cohorting patients who acquired drug-resistant pathogens, active surveillance cultures once a week, and enhanced environmental disinfection in January 2013. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the systemic infection control bundle approach against acquisition of drug-resistant pathogens.Methods:This was a retrospective historical control study conducted from April 2008 to March 2019 in 18-bed ICU of a tertiary care hospital in Japan.

One of the most important strategy to prevent CRBSI is to minimize the duration of central venous catheterization. We built a medical team consisting of doctors, nurses and pharmacists in ICU to discuss whether patients needed central venous catheter (CVC) in terms of monitoring hemodynamics and administering drugs, and recommend catheter removal to attending physicians every day in April 2019. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether our team-based approach could shorten the total duration of catheterization and reduce CRBSI.Methods:This was a retrospective historical control study conducted from April 2018 to October 2019 in the ICU of a tertiary care hospital in Japan. Every patient admitted to the ICU during the study period was eligible if they were inserted CVC. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Conventional (from April 2018 to March 2019) or Intervention (from April 2019 to October 2019). We set the primary endpoint as onset of CRBSI. The secondary endpoints included the duration of central venous catheterization, the length of ICU stay and hospital mortality. CRBSI was defined as bloodstream infection in patients with CVC, not related to another site.Results:We included 428 patients: 259 in the Conventional group and 169 in the Intervention group. The reduced, though nonsignificant, tendency of CRBSI was observed in the Intervention group [hazard ratio, 0.341(95% confidence interval, 0.074-1.557; p = 0.213)]. The Intervention group was significantly associated with reduced duration of central venous catheterization (5 days vs 7 days; p < 0.01). No difference was observed in the length of ICU stay and in-hospital mortality between groups.Conclusions:The team-based approach to assess CVC necessity could shorten the duration of central venous catheterization and might reduce CRBSI.P425 Assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility of the most common Gram-negative intensive care unit (ICU) respiratory pathogens in deciding antimicrobial therapyP Moise1, M Gonzalez1, I"

The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen predominance and to evaluate the probability of covering the most common Gram-negative pathogens in ICU patients with respiratory infections.Methods:Data were collected from multiple US and European hospitals as part of the SMART Surveillance Program (2018). MIC (mg/L) testing was performed by broth microdilution, with susceptibility defined as follows forP. aeruginosa& Enterobacterales: ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC ≤4 & ≤2; piperacillin/tazobactam MIC ≤16 & ≤8; meropenem MIC ≤2 & ≤1; ceftazidime MIC ≤8 & ≤8, respectively.Results:78 hospitals from 24 countries provided 3384 Gram-negative respiratory isolates from patients located in an ICU in the US (22%), Eastern Europe (40%) and Western Europe (38%) in 2018. The 4 most common pathogens isolated wereP. aeruginosa(26%),K. pneumoniae(15%),E. coli(13%), andA. baumannii(10%). Among Enterobacterales, 30% (588/1955) were ESBL positive. Figure 1 provides the probability of covering the most common respiratory Gram-negative pathogens from ICU patients. Co-resistance between commonly prescribed first line β-lactam antibiotics is common: when non-susceptibility (NS) of one agent was present, susceptibility to other β-lactams was generally <35%. Ceftolozane/tazobactam provided the most reliable in vitro activity in both empiric and adjustment prescribing scenarios compared to other β-lactam antibiotics.Conclusions:Ceftolozane/tazobactam ensured a wide coverage of the most common Gram-negative respiratory pathogens demonstrating high susceptibility levels and provided the most reliable in vitro activity in both empiric and adjustment antibiotic prescribing scenarios.

Even though 2/1 g dose safety administered as a 3-hour-infusion has been already assessed, these patients can be under renal replacement therapy (RRT) and suffer changes in their volume of distribution (Vd) that may affect antibiotic concentrations.Methods:The objective was to determine concentration reached by 3g C/T (3-hour infusion) in septic patients on RRT (CVVHDF) and interdose behavior. We have used RRT machine PRISMAFLEX with Oxyris filter and M100. HPLC-UV method was used for simultaneous quantification of C/T. Study population consisted of three obese critically ill patients with sepsis, on CVVHDF while receiving 3g C/T every 8 hours. Samples were taken of prefilter, post filter blood and effluent, 30 min before infusion and 1, 2 and 4 hours after the end of it.Results:We found great interpatient variability with the lowest C-concentration values in the patient with more hemodynamic instability using Oxyris filter. Even though Cmax was less than reported in healthy subjects, we found similar values of AUC and t ½ in comparison with healthy population studies. Cmax of T was also compromised in comparison with values reported in healthy subjects, but with higher AUC and t ½. CVVHDF contributes to C/T clearance. M100 filter showed the least clearance and higher values of AUC and t ½. Extraction rate was similar in all patients and filters (Figure 1).Conclusions:Cmax achieved may be impaired because of the varying Vd caused by obesity and RRT, but not affecting the antibiotic characteristics and behaviour. We conclude that because of the variety of clinical conditions, C-concentration is compromised particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients. However, the small sample doesn´t let us extrapolate these results. The extended infusion seems to be adequate to achieve the interdose antibiotic concentration.Fig. 1 (abstract P432).Patient PK/PD measurementsP433 Alfatorquetenovirus: a new sepsis biomarker?SM Martinez castro1, N Segura Marín2, E Albert3, D Navarro3, P Pardo2, Ja Carbonell2, E Carbonell4, G Aguilar21Hospital Clinico Universitario, Department Of Anesthesiology And Intensive Care, Valencia, Spain;2Hospital Clínico Universitario De Valencia, Servicio De Anestesiología, Reanimación Y Tratamiento Del Dolor, Valencia, Spain;3Hospital Clínico Universitario De Valencia, Microbiology Department, Valencia, Spain;4Hospital Clínico Universitario De Valencia, Intensive Care Unit, Valencia, SpainIntroduction:The use of biomarkers in sepsis is useful for early diagnosis and prognosis.

The SOFA and APACHE II scales were calculated and patients stratified according to these values ​​in good and poor prognosis. TTV quantitative determination was carried by using a quantitative CRP2. We calculated area under the curve (AUC) of TTV plasma levels ​​as a function of time. The statistical analysis involved U-Mann-Whitney and Spearman test, using Chi2for qualitative variables.Results:Results showed a not significant (NS) inverse relationship between the TTV AUC and the patient proinflammatory level.

An inverse relationship was found between PCT and CRP values ​​and the TTV copies /ml plasma, NS correlation in the case of PCT. There was a clear trend between the neutrophils´ expansion and the regression line slope, obtained between TTV loads in the first two study steps.These results indicate a possible relationship between TTV DNA count and immunological alteration.Conclusions:The TTV quantitative determination could be useful as a proinflammatory marker in sepsis, with some benefits: low cost, easy determination and good correlation with immune system functionalit. It will be necessary to perform a larger study to check our hypothesis and to establish a TTV level threshold that may allow to anticípate the disease prognosis.References:1. Focosi D et al.

Production of several types of carbapenemases (KPC, NDM and OXA-48) is common in K. pneumoniae strains. Carbapemenase production is a marker of extreme antibacterial resistance. The aim of our study was to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial infections caused by producing KPC, NDM and OXA-48 K. pneumonia strains in burn ICU.Methods:Total of 26 patients with nosocomial infections caused by 26 carbapenem resistance strains of K. pneumoniae were included in the study, from whom 3 had lower respiratory tract infection, 23 had skin and skin structure infection.

A critical point may be the potential interaction with antimicrobial therapy, which remains the mainstay of sepsis treatment. The aim of our study was to investigate the vancomycin (VAN) removal during blood purification using anin vitromodel of hemoperfusion (HP) with HA330 cartridge (Jafron, Zhuhai City, China), most widely used in China and actually available in Europe.Methods:This is an experimental study. Three independent experiments were performed: we injected 250 mg of VAN in 500ml of whole blood from healthy donors (experiment 1 and 2) or in 500ml of balanced solution (experiment 3) in order to assess membrane saturation. A closed-circuit (blood flow of 250ml/min) simulating HP ran using HA330. Samples were collected from arterial line at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes; VAN plasma concentrations were measured and removal was evaluated using mass balance analysis. Differences in mass removal was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test.Results:Figure 1 shows VAN mass at each timepoints. We observed no difference between in blood and in balanced solution experiments (p-value>0.05), suggesting that the adsorptive mechanism wasn't primarily mediated by plasma protein. HA330 was saturated after adsorption of a total of 280.28±12.33mg of VAN. The adsorptive kinetics showed an exponential reduction of VAN mass that reached a plateau after 30 minutes of circulation.Conclusions:In our study, simulating in vivo conditions of HP using HA330 during sepsis, a rapid and clinically relevant removal of VAN has been shown.

ICU patients may require renal replacement therapy (RRT). Sharing RRT equipment carries a risk of BBV transmission, which mainly relates to Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV. Since 2012, all Glasgow Royal Infirmary ICU patients undergo routine BBV screening, with RRT machines allocated for patients with specific BBV statuses. Routine BBV testing is beneficial to both the individual and society. HCV is a pertinent health issue in Scotland. The Scottish government aims to eliminate HCV by 2030 and is researching innovative and cost-effective methods to identify undiagnosed infections.Methods:This single-centre retrospective observational study examined prospectively collected clinical data from 1069 ICU admissions. Proportions were compared using a two-proportion z-test and a logistic regression model was carried out to determine if deprivation quintile was independently associated with the seroprevalence of BBVs.Results:The BBV seroprevalence in the cohort studied: 0.45% (HBV), 11.7% (HCV), 0.91% (HIV). The seroprevalence of HBV in the cohort studied was similar to that of Scotland (p=0.11), but the seroprevalence of HCV (p<0.001) and HIV (p=0.01) were statistically significantly higher than that of Scotland. Due to the small number of reactive test results for HBV and HIV, the relationship between deprivation and BBV seroprevalence was explored for HCV only. The only independent variable associated with a reactive anti-HCV test result was “current or previous illicit drug use” (adjusted odds ratio of 40.2; 95% confidence interval of 21.1-76.4; p<0.001).Conclusions:This study shows that routine BBV testing in the ICU is useful in discovering new BBV infections. This is the first observational study focusing on the value of routine BBV testing in an ICU setting to our knowledge.P438 Assessment of the clinical significance of bacteremia causative pathogens in ICU"

Pirogov National Medical Surgical Center, Pharmakologist, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:It was shown that bacteremia in ICU patient with infection of different localization becomes an independent risk factor for adverse outcome, but it remains unclear how clinical outcome of bacteremia depends on causative pathogen and its features. The aim of the study was to compare mortality rate and clinical outcomes of ICU patients with bacteremia complicated infections according to pathogen and its properties.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study from January 2011 to December 2017 in four general ICUs of a multidisciplinary hospital. 7560 patients were screened, 374 patients with infection complicated by bacteremia were included in the study. The average age was 61±14.5 years, male 63.1%, APACHE2 score 16 (11-21), SOFA 5 (2-7). According to the causative agent the cohort was divided into subgroups: ESKAPE (136 patients), MDRPseudomonas aeruginosa(18 patients), CPRKlebsiella pneumoniae(32 patients), Candida spp. (21 patients). The comparison subgroup consisted of 217 patients with bacteremia caused by non-ESCAPE pathogens. We evaluated the days of mechanical ventilation, duration of antibiotic therapy (AMT), ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS and mortality (Table 1).Results:Mortality in patients with bacteremia caused by non-ESKAPE pathogens was 23.5%,Candidaspp. – 42.9% (p=0.052), in MDRPs.aeruginosasubgroup – 44.4% (p=0.084), ESKAPE – 50.7% (p<0.0001), CPRKl.pneumoniae –68.75% (p<0.0001).Conclusions:Bacteremia caused by CPR Klebsiella pneumoniae or all ESKAPE group pathogens, as well as candidemia, caused byCandidaspp. significantly worsens the clinical outcomes and increases mortality of ICU patients.Table 1 (abstract P438).Results. * p-value versus non-ESKAPESubgroupMechanical ventilation, days*AMT, days*ICU LOS, days*Hospital LOS, days*non-ESKAPE5 (0-15)11.5 (7-20)12 (5-22)30 (17-55)ESKAPE7.5 (2-24) р=0.00212 (8-21) р=0.16215 (7-28.5) р=0.01932 (20-57) р=0.247CPR Kl.pneumoniae7.5 (2-26) р=0.04312 (9-28) р=0.28615 (8-27) р=0.16931 (21.5-58) р=0.481MDR Ps.aeruginosa11 (6-27) р=0.02314 (8-21) р=0.27918 (8-30) р=0.09932.5 (15-49) р=0.717Candida spp.12.5 (2-41) р=0.023-19.5 (9-41) р=0.0344.5 (18-75) р=0.263P439 Assessing the volume of blood taken for blood culture and culture positivity – do we need to take less blood?TM Mann1, M Salim2, S Haider2, AH Mayo1, KK Kaye21Assuta medical center, Department of Intensive Care, Ashdod, Israel;2Detroit Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Detroit, United StatesIntroduction:It is commonly accepted that larger blood culture (BC) volumes (BCV) increase the yield of true positive cultures, and optimally 20 cc of blood should be obtained per set (2 bottles).

Blood volume was estimated automatically from blood background signal data in the BD BACTEC FX instrument. Cultures were analyzed for each bottle. Data was summarized for every month as the average volume and number of cultures taken and rate of positive BC for every unit. Units were classified according to unit type (ICU, Medicine, Surgery, Mixed, Emergency Department (ED), Organ/BMT or \"other\" which did not fit the previous categories) and analyzed as a group.Results:A total of 23795 cultures were taken in 84 units. There is a positive association between BV and positive BC rate for ED and “other” units (IRR=1.27, p=0.006 for the ED, IRR=5.00, p<0.001 for “other” unit). All other units had no association between BV and positive BC rate (Figure 1). Secondary analysis, excluding Pediatric units, gave very similar results. When comparing BV between unit types, the ED and “other” unit had significantly lower BV (2.4 ml in the ED and 3.5 ml in “other” unit compared to 4.9 ml in the ICU, 4.7 ml in surgery, 4.2 ml in mixed and 7.7 ml in BMT).Conclusions:The correlation between BV and positive BC rate is probably limited to units taking very low BV for cultures. Units taking volumes above 4 ml show no improvement in positive BC rate when higher volumes are taken.

The present analysis is aimed at comparing the Indian subset of patients with that of the overall trial population and to ascertain any similarity or difference in the primary efficacy endpoint and safety/tolerability in these two groups.Methods:In SECURE trial, 258 patients in one group received (I) & another 258 patients received (V). The Indian subset had 29 patients. We have done a qualitative analysis as the sample size of the Indian subset was small. Non-inferiority of (I) to (V) in terms of all cause mortality from first dose to day 42 was assessed in overall patients. The treatment difference between (I) and (V) group in the Indian subset of patients was analyzed. Proportion of patients who had to discontinue treatment due to TEAEs was analyzed.Results:The all-cause mortality in the overall trial population met non-inferiority margin (Table 1). In the Indian subset, it was higher for (I) than (V). There was a lower incidence of ocular, hepatobiliary, skin & subcutaneous tissue disorders in the (I) treated patients (see Table 1). In Indian subset, the above adverse events were less in the (I) group, but statistical inference could not be done due to small sample size. However, similar trend of less number of patients discontinuing therapy due to TEAEs in the (I) treated patients was seen in the overall patients & the Indian subset.Conclusions:The all-cause mortality in the Indian subset was higher in the (I) patients. A trend similar to the overall population regarding safety parameters favoring (I) was seen in the Indian patients.

Patients were divided in two groups according to the antibiotherapy:group A Meropenem + Colistin and group B Meropenem + Colistin + Ceftazidim-avibactam.Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad6 applying T-test and Kaplan-Meier curves, having the in-hospital mortality as primary outcome and days of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay as secondary outcomes.Results:Mean age(y.o) in group A was 46 and 52 in group B and in both groups mean Charlson comorbidity index was 3 points. Survival percent was higher in the group treated with Ceftazidim-avibactam (67 % vs 57 %, p = 0.08)-(Fig. 1). Length of stay was significantly decreased in group B (26.5 days vs 43 days in group A, p = 0.046). Number of days under mechanical ventilation was also decreased in the ceftazidim-avibactam group (19 vs 22) but the data was not statistically significant.Conclusions:In light of the important thread of multiresistantA. baumanniiand the lack of therapeutic measures, the synergistic activity of Ceftazidim-avibactam use in combination with other antibiotics may be a promising approach to lower the mortality and hospitalization in critically ill patients diagnosed with VAP.Fig. 1 (abstract P443).Survival proportions : Survival of two groups.

Colonization precedes infection in most instances; therefore it may be a marker of a poor outcome. We tried to determine the impact of colonization on mortality at 28 and 90 days in a population of patients admitted to one medical and one surgical ICU in the same institution.Methods:Medical records review over three years 2016-2018 of all patients admitted to one surgical et one medical ICU at Hotel Dieu de France Hospital staying more than 24h. Colonization to resistant bacteria was defined as MRSA, ESBL, MDR, and VRE. All patient received a nasal and rectal screen on ICU admission, in intubated patients tracheal aspirate was considered as colonization in the absence of clinical respiratory tract infection. Demographics, APACHE, SOFA, immunosupression, Charleston comorbidity index, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, hospitalization and antibiotic use in the previous 3 month were collected. Mortality at 28 and 90 days was assessed through medical records or phone call. Pearson Chi-Square was calculated for the association of colonization and mortality at 28 and 90 days, and subsequently odd ratio was estimated.Results:1337 patients fulfilled our study criteria. 413 0r 53.3% were colonized, 28 patients or 2.8% of the population had MRSA on nasal screen. Rectal swab identified 44.5 % of ESBL, 3% of MDR and 4.8% of VRE. Mortality at 28 and 90 days were 19% and 30% respectively. No significant difference was found between either nasal or rectal or any colonization and mortality at 28 and 90 days. Odd ratio for 28 days mortality in colonized patient was calculated to 0.98 (CI:0.74-1.29) and for 90 days mortality 1.09 (CI:0.85-1.39).Conclusions:In this study we concluded that colonization with resistant bacteria is not a risk factor for mortality at 28 and 90 days.P445 Continuous infusion vancomycin: A better option in critical care?M Murphy1, Z Alrifai21Nottingham University Hospitals, Critical Care, Nottingham, United Kingdom;2Nottingham University Hospitals, Intensive Care Medicine, Nottingham, United"

    "full_text": "Intensive Care Medicine, Nottingham, United KingdomIntroduction:Critically unwell patients have been observed to respond unpredictably to traditional intermittent dosing (ID) schedules of vancomycin, likely due to the complex physiological derangements caused by critical illness. Continuous infusion (CI) of vancomycin has been suggested to overcome such problems by allowing more regular therapeutic drug monitoring and subsequent effective dose titration [1].Methods:This study conducted at a tertiary intensive care unit, reports our experience following implementation of a continuous vancomycin infusion protocol. Prospective data was collected over two consecuative periods of three months, initially capturing plasma levels for ID (target level of 15-20mg/L) followed by reviewing plasma concentration levels in a CI protocol (target level of 20-25 mg/L). Patients recieving renal replacement therapy were excluded.Results:A total of 22 intermittent vancomycin prescriptions were administered and dosing levels observed. In the three month CI period, 26 patients received CI vancomycin and levels subsequently checked. The CI protocol resulted in increased blood sampling (107 samples in CI group vs. 73 samples in ID cohort). Two non serious incidents were reported in the CI cohort relating to preparation of vancomycin. Both groups had a comparable median time to therapeutic range (48 hours). However, CI vancomycin group had a greater proportion of first samples outside the desired therapeutic range (70%vs 36%) (Figure 1). As the therapy continued, CI vancomycin demonstrated a greater propensity towards consistent therapeutic levels than that observed with ID. 83% of patients on a CI regime achieve the desired target levels compared to 77% in the ID cohortConclusions:Continuous infusion vancomycin protocol is a safe, acceptable and effective alternative to intermittent dosing of vancomycin in critical care.References:1.

Sklifosofsky research institute of emergency medicine, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:The aim of the study was to investigate into effectiveness of lithium chloride (LiCl) as agent that prevents damage to the monolayer of endothelial cells under the action of serum from multiple trauma patients with septic shock.Methods:Serum from 5 pts with septic shock (Sepsis-3) and 5 healthy donors was withdrawn. Monolayer of Ea.hy926 endothelial cells were incubated for 3 hrs at 37 ° C with healthy person’s serum and with septic patient’s serum without LiCl and with it at concentrations of 0.01 mmol, 0.1 mmol, 1 mmol, 10 mmol. LiCl was added 1 hour before the change of serum. After incubation cells were washed and fixed with 2% paraform solution and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 solution. Fixed cells were stained with primary antibodies to VE-cadherin and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Oregon Green 488 fluorescent dye as well as with phalloid red and Hoechst dye 33342. Images were processed by fluorescence microscope and ImageJ 1.44p and MetaVue 4.6 programs. Western blotting was used to detect antibodies to VE-cadherin, claudin and GSK-3beta. Statistics included Mann-Whitney test and chi-square test.Results:Incubation of a monolayer of endothelial cells with 5% serum of septic shock patients led to loss of VE-cadherin contacts and decrease of claudine. Preincubation with LiCl 0.01 mmol did not prevent dismantling of claudine, actin, VE-cadherins; 0.1 mmol LiCl prevented it (p>0.05), but at higher concentrations (1 mmol, 10 mmol) almost completely protected endothelial monolayer from destruction of intercellular contacts (p<0.05). Serum had almost no effect on the phospho-GSK-3β level after 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 1 hr, but caused a significant (60%) decrease in its level after 2 and 4 hrs. LiCl (1 mmol) caused a significant increase in phospho-GSK-3β already 15 mins and up to 4 hrs after exposure.Conclusions:LiCl prevents septic damage to the monolayer of endothelial cells in vitro in a GSK-3beta mediated way.P452 Autonomic nervous system, arterial stiffness and peripheral vascular tone alterations in septic"

Acute inflammation is presumed to increase arterial stiffness of large arteries in experimental studies [1]. The objectives of this work are to verify if standard SS resuscitation modulate mechanical vascular properties and to verify if alterations in these vascular properties and ANS activity are correlated.Methods:A protocol of fecal peritonitis septic shock and standard resuscitation (fluids and noradrenaline) was applied on 6 pigs. The arterial blood pressure waveform was recorded in the central aorta and in the femoral and radial arteries. The characteristic arterial time constanttauwas computed at the three arterial sites, based on the two-element Windkessel model [2]. The total arterial compliance (AC) and the total peripheral resistance (TPR) were also estimated. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) spectral power of diastolic blood pressure, and indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were computed to assess ANS functionality.Results:Septic shock induced a severe vascular disarray, decoupling the usual pressure wave propagation from central to peripheral sites, as shown by the inversion of pulse pressure (PP) amplification, with a higher PP in the central aorta than in the peripheral arteries during shock. The time constanttautogether with AC and TPR were independently decreased. A decrease in BRS, LF power, and HRV describe an ANS dysfunction. After the administration of fluids and noradrenaline, both vascular and autonomic dysfunction persisted and these were found to be significantly correlated.Conclusions:Measures of mechanical vascular function and ANS activity could represent an useful end-point to guide further clinical investigations and refine our understanding of SS mechanisms, especially under medical treatment.References:1.

Indeed, LPS found in plasma of WT mice was proportionally less active, sustaining a higher capacity for WT mice to neutralize LPS (Figure 1B). Quantitative dosage of LPS in portal blood, 15 minutes after IP injection, revealed that plasma LPS associates rapidly with the lipoprotein fraction (HDL plus LDL), and in higher proportions as compared to PLTP-KO mice (66 [62-72] % vs 50 [41-54] %, respectively; p < 0.01). In line with previous studies, these observations now indicate that, LPS readily associates with lipoproteins in a neutralizing process PLTP mediated. Finally, even with a heavy LPS load (25 mg/kg), the bulk of LPS was still found in the lipoprotein fraction (80 [80-90] %), suggesting that lipoproteins plus PLTP in WT mice have a high capacity to detoxify intraperitoneal LPS.Conclusions:In a model of peritonitis, lipoproteins and PLTP were found to constitute key playors for peritoneal clearance and neutralization of LPS.

For the inducible inactivation of ATX, Enpp2n/ntargeted mice were crossed with the R26Cre-ERT2mice and tamoxifen induction enabled temporal control of floxed gene expression. R26CreERT2/Enpp2n/nmice were more protected against LPS-induced endotoxemia compared to control mice. Enpp2-Tg mice overexpressing autotaxin and showing a 2-fold increase in plasma levels do not display improved survival rates compared to control group.Conclusions:ATX participates in systemic inflammation, as reduced ATX levels in circulation decrease lethality of mice from caused by LPS. The excess amount of circulating ATX does not exacerbate the systemic inflammatory response to LPS.P456 Neutrophil-related genes and pneumoniaM Khadzhieva1, A Kuzovlev2, A Gracheva3, L Salnikova11Federal Research and Clinical Center of Intensive Care Medicine and Rehabilitology; N.I.

Host genetics plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases including Pn [1]. The aim of the study was to analyze the variability of genes associated with neutrophil activation in pneumonia.Methods:To identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) in community-acquired (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) dataset «Genome-wide blood transcriptional profiling in critically ill patients - MARS consortium» (GSE65682) from Gene Expression Omnibus was analyzed (logFC≥2.0, FDR-correctedP-value<0.05). DEGs associated with neutrophil activation were selected according to gene ontology GO:0042119 («neutrophil activation»). With the use of GTEx Portal and Blood eQTL browser, we searched for eSNPs (expression single nucleotide polymorphisms) in whole blood for neutrophil activation genes differentially expressed in CAP/HAP. These eSNPs were further analyzed for their association with Pn via the Global Biobank Engine (GBE).Results:A total of 46 DEGs fromGSE65682correspond to GO:0042119 genes (43 up- and 3 down-regulated) of which 39 genes were common to CAP and HAP.

The barrier is formed by tight junction structures between the cerebral endothelial cells [2]. We investigated the expression of tight junction proteins related to endothelial permeability in brain autopsy specimens in critically ill patients deceased with sepsis, and analyzed the relationship of BBB damage and measures systemic inflammation and systemic organ dysfunction.Methods:Case series included all adult patients deceased with sepsis in the years 2007- 2015 with brain specimens taken at autopsy available.Specimens were categorized according to anatomical location (cerebrum, hippocampus, cerebellum). The immunohistochemical stainings were performed for occludin, ZO-1 and claudin. Patients were categorized as having BBB damage if there was no expression of occludin in the endothelium of cerebral microvessels.Results:38% (18/47) developed multiple organ failure before death. 74.5% (35/47) had septic shock.

Animal models have demonstrated that various vasoactive oxylipin pathways may be implicated in septic shock pathophysiology but these have been poorly studied in humans.Methods:Oxylipin profiling was performed on serum samples collected on enrolment to the VANISH (Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine as Initial Therapy in Septic Shock) trial. Samples were analysed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Patients were followed up until 28 days.Results:Samples were collected from 154 of 409 (37.7%) patients on inclusion to the trial and 39 (25.3%) had died by 28 days. Non-survivors were found to have higher levels of a number of oxylipins including: 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) (p<0.01), 11,12-DHET (p=0.03), 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (p=0.02), 14-hydroxyoctadeca-pentaenoic acid (p=0.04) but lower levels of the precursor eicosapentaenoic acid (p=0.012). When corrected for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg test, only 14,15-DHET remained significant (p=0.025). Although there was a difference in median 14,15-DHET levels between survivors and non-survivors, many values were below the level of detection (n=84/154 (54.5%)). As such, we also analysed 14-15-DHET as a binary variable (Figure 1). Patients with detectable 14,15-DHET were more likely to die (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.2-4.6], p<0.01) and have a higher median lactate (p =0.01) and total SOFA score (p<0.01) than those patients where baseline 14,15-DHET was undetectable.Conclusions:Our study suggests the oxylipin 14,15-DHET may be associated with septic shock severity and 28-day mortality. These results are consistent with the known vasodilatory actions of this class of oxylipin. More work is needed to confirm its exact role in septic shock and whether this pathway is amenable to therapeutic intervention.Fig. 1 (abstract P459).Survival"

The aim of the study was to investigate into the antiinflammatory effects of lithium chloride on human neutrophils in vitro.Methods:Study was carried out on neutrophils isolated from the blood of 5 healthy donors. 50% of neutrophils were activated by 100 mkM fMLP, 50% - by 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS); then their activity was evaluated by fluorescent antibodies to CD11b and CD66b degranulation markers. Intact and activated neutrophils were treated with a solution of lithium chloride (9 mmol). Immunoblotting was used to assess GSK3b activity in neutrophils. Mann-Whitney criterion and p<0.05 were used for statistics.Results:Lithium chloride 9 mmol decreased the level of expression of CD11b on intact neutrophils by 16% (p=0.07), CD66b by 15% (p=0.07). fMLP increased CD11b expression on neutrophils by 2.6 times (p=0.0007), CD66b by 2.5 times (p=0, 0022). Addition of lithium chloride solution to fMLP activated neutrophils reduced the expression of CD11b (p=0.0317) and CD66b (p=0.0079). LPS increased CD11b and CD 66b expression by 2.1 times (p=0.0007, p=0.0022, respectively); addition of lithium chloride reduced the expression of CD11b (p=0,0317) and CD66b (p=0.0079) on neutrophils. fMLP led to a dephosphorylation of GSK-3b by 47% (p<0.05), lithium chloride increased its phosphorylation by 387% (p <0.05). Adding lithium chloride to activated fMLP neutrophils restored the level of GSK-3b phosphorylation by 277% compared to controls (p<0.05).Conclusions:Lithium chloride modulates the inflammatory activation of neutrophils by bacterial components through the phosphorylation of GSK3b in neutrophils.P461 Human host immune responses to lipopolysaccharide: A comparison study between in vivo endotoxemia model and ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulations using an immune profiling panelDM Tawfik1, JM Lankelma2, L Vachot3, E Cerrato3, A Pachot3, WJ Wiersinga2, J Textoris31bioMerieux, Medical Diagnostic Discovery Department (MD3), Lyon, France;2Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands;3bioMerieux, Lyon, FranceIntroduction:Sepsis, a leading cause of mortality among critically-ill patients in the ICU, recently recognized by the WHO as a global health burden.

Interestingly, markers related to neutrophils were expressed in opposite directions, which might be due to the presence of cell recruitment and feedback loopsin vivo.Conclusions:The majority of IPP markers showed similar patterns of expression post-LPS challenge in both models, except for several markers related to neutrophils and T-cells.

However, whether their early measurement at emergency department (ED) presentation also predicts mortality and organ failure still needs to be clarified.Methods:In this multicentre observational study, septic patients admitted to 5 Italian EDs were included [1]. At ED presentation blood samples were taken for routine biochemical analyses and serum Mer and Gas6 measurement. Urinalyses, blood gas analyses and chest X-ray were routinely performed. Mortality at 7 and 30 days, as well as the presence of organ damage such as acute kidney injury (AKI), thrombocytopenia, PT-INR derangement and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) were evaluated according to baseline levels of Mer and Gas6.Results:890 septic patients were enrolled between March 2013 and March 2015. 7 and 30-day mortality were 9.7% and 19.9%, respectively.

The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between glycocalyx shedding and respiratory failure, SOFA score, plasma angiopoietin (Ang)-2 level and patient survival.Methods:Plasma samples were collected from 30 septic shock patients from admission to ICU discharge and 10 healthy volunteers. Plasma syndecan (Syn)-1 and Ang-2 were measured and clinical data was also collected. Septic shock patients were classified into 3 groups according to the time-course change of Syn-1 levels. Excess Syn-1 (>400 ng/ml) during 0 to 3 days and remaining high following 4 to 7 days were assigned to Group I. Excess Ang-2 during 0 to 3 days and decreased following 4 to 7 days were assigned to Group II. Moderate increase (<400 ng/ml) during 0 to 7 days were assigned to Group III.Results:Plasma Syn-1 levels are positively associated with increased Ang-2 levels (r2=0.41, P= 0.005), suggesting that Ang-2 is involved in endothelial hyperpermeability. Fluid balance and ventilator-free days (VFD) are significantly increased in Group I as compared with Group III. SOFA score, Apache II and patient outcome does not show any differences between Groups I, II, and III.Conclusions:The positive correlation between glycocalyx shedding and fluid balance indicates plasma Syn-1 may be a valuable marker for endothelial hyperpermeability. The negative correlation between glycocalyx shedding and VFD indicates plasma Syn-1 may be a valuable marker for respiratory failure. The plasma level of Syn-1 for prognosis and organ failure excluding ARDS in patients with septic shock requires further investigation.P464 Serial procalcitonin measurements in the intensive care unit at Hiroshima University HospitalK Hosokawa, S Yamaga, M Fujino, K Ota, N ShimeHiroshima University Hospital, Department of Emergency and Critical Care"

Moreover, including serial PCT measurements in the management of acute respiratory infection reduces the duration of antibiotic therapy without increasing the mortality. However, limited real-world information is available regarding the use of PCT in intensive care units (ICUs).Methods:We extracted and analysed data from January 1 to December 31, 2018 from all the orders and results of PCT measurements in the ICU (26 beds) at Hiroshima University Hospital.Results:A total of 1,252 PCT measurements from 409 ICU patients were included. In 170 patients, PCT was tested ≥3 times during a single ICU stay. Serial PCT measurements showed a fade-out pattern (76 [45%] patients), a second day-peaked decrease pattern (35 [21%] patients), and a series of negative patterns (30 [18%] patients). Compared to patients who demonstrated the fade-out pattern, those who demonstrated the second day-peaked decrease pattern had higher mortality rates (3% vs. 20%, p < 0.01).Conclusions:Approximately one-third patients in the ICU who had decreasing serial PCT values demonstrated the second day-peaked decrease pattern. Since this group of patients had poorer survival, further studies are needed to clarify the association between a late rise in PCT levels and delayed therapeutic intervention.P465 The early diagnostics of the sepsis of newborns on mechanical ventilationM Pukhtinskaya1, V Estrin21State Medical University, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Rostov on don, Russia;2State Medical University, Rostov on don, RussiaIntroduction:Sepsis diagnostics during the pre-clinical stage remains a most complex issue.

Adult patients of >18 years with diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock (as per sepsis 3 criteria) at admission were included. Demographic and clinical parameters were noted at admission. Biomarker levels were measured serially at admission, on day 4 and day 8 of ICU stay along with clinical and laboratory parameters. Appropriate statistical tests were used using SPSS 23. CD 64 was expressed as % age of neutrophils expressing positivity.Results:Sixty patients were analyzed. All parameters were compared between survivors and non survivors. Demographics were comparable. Most common source of sepsis was lungs and majority were admitted due to medical reason. Non-survivors had significantly increased number of days with septic shock. At day 8 median values of all the biomarkers and the SOFA score were significantly higher in the non-survivor group (p<0.05). There was a decreasing trend of all 3 biomarkers and SOFA score amongst survivors. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, increased CD64 and CRP levels between baseline and day 8, increased days with septic shock and increased SOFA score at baseline were significant (p<0.05) predictors of mortality. Highest area under the ROC curve was obtained for number of days with septic shock (0.857) followed by increased CD64 between baseline and day 8 (0.798). Though serial PCT levels significantly increased amongst non-survivors, it did not predict mortality.Conclusions:Serial level of biomarkers in ICU"

Plasma levels of soluble TREM-1, a marker of TREM-1 pathway activation, are correlated with patients’ outcome. The role of TREM-1 in the development of immunosuppression in septic shock patients has never been assessed. So far, decreased monocyte HLA-DR expression (mHLA-DR) is the most studied marker of immune alterations in septic shock.Methods:Plasma sTREM-1 levels were retrospectively measured at Day 1-2, 3-4 and 6-8 in 116 septic shock patients from the IMMUNOSEPSIS cohort (NCT02803346), included between 01/2016 and 12/2018, using a validated ELISA method. The associations between sTREM-1, mHLA-DR, 28-day survival status, and occurrence of ICU-acquired nosocomial infection (NI) were assessed.Results:Neither sTREM-1 nor mHLA-DR levels at D1/2 were associated with the occurrence of ICU-acquired NI. However, 28-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with D1-2 sTREM-1 value superior to the median (39.6% vs 11.3%, p=0.0103; median=539 pg/mL). A significant inverse correlation was found between mHLA-DR at D6-8 and sTREM-1 at D1-2 (Sp -0.378, p<0.0001) and at D6-8 (Sp -0.382, p<0.0001). At D6-8, when stratifying patients based on sTREM-1 (400pg/mL) and mHLA-DR (5000 AB/C), patients combining elevated sTREM-1 and low mHLA-DR presented with significantly higher 28-day mortality (47.6% vs 8.7%, p = 0.0003, Chi-squared test) and NI incidence (31.8 vs 12%, p=0.044) compared with patients with low sTREM-1 / high mHLA-DR.Conclusions:This study shows for the first time that TREM-1 pathway activation is associated with septic shock-induced immunosuppression, as shown by an inverse correlation between sTREM-1 at baseline and mHLA-DR expression at D6-8. Persisting high sTREM-1 values and low mHLA-DR expression in septic shock patients are significantly associated with higher rate of ICU-acquired infection and mortality.P469 Added value of serial bio-adrenomedullin measurement in addition to lactate for the prognosis of septic patients admitted to ICUA Blet1, C De Roquetaillade1, O Hartmann2, J Schulte2, J Struck2, PF Laterre3, E Gayat1, A Mebazaa1, BG Chousterman41Hôpital Lariboisière, Paris, France;2Shpingotec, Hennigsdorf, Germany;3St Luc university hospital, Brussels, Belgium;4Hôpital Lariboisière, Département"

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends to guide resuscitation on normalization of lactate levels [2], however this is debated [3]. We have shown that plasma levels of bio-adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) were associated with patient outcome during sepsis [4]. We therefore aimed to evaluate the added value of bio-ADM to lactate measurement in the AdrenOSS cohort.Methods:This is a post-hoc analysis of the Adrenomedullin and Outcome in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock (AdrenOSS) cohort study. The AdrenOSS study is a prospective observational study conducted in twenty-four centers and included 583 septic patients [4]. We studied the relationship between the association of initial evolution of lactate plasma levels and bio-ADM level at 24h and outcome in patients for whom both markers were available at admission and one day later (“24h”). Bio-ADM levels below 70 pg/mL were considered as low, and high if greater than 70 pg/mL [4].Results:In patients with high lactate levels (>2 mmol/L) at admission (n=328), lactate normalization (<2 mmol/L) at 24h was associated with better outcome than in patients with persistently high lactate at 24h (28-day mortality 15.9% vs 41.9% respectively, HR 3.3 [2.0-5.3], p<0.001) (Figure 1). Among patients with decreasing lactate, high and low bio-ADM levels at 24h identified patients with different outcomes (28-day mortality 7% vs 26% for low vs high bio-ADM respectively, HR 4.4 [1.6-11.7], p<0.005). High and low bio-ADM levels at 24h also differentiated outcome of patients with persistently elevated lactate (HR 4.5 [1.6-12.3], p<0.005). In patients with low initial lactate, neither lactate or bio-ADM had no added prognostic.Conclusions:Our data suggest that measurement of bio-ADM in addition to lactate may help physicians to refine risk stratification and therefore to guide resuscitation during sepsis.References:1.

Sepsis and severe sepsis is associated with a hypercoagulable state where the clot microstructure is known to be a tight and highly elastic clot, which is potentially resistant to fibrinolysis (Figure 1). Conversely, septic shock is associated with a hypocoagulable state where the clot microstructure is loose and structurally weak. The study aim to investigate the effect of fluid resuscitation and replacement in clot microstructure over 24 hours.Methods:100 patients (50 sepsis, 20 severe sepsis and 30 septic shock) were included in the study. All these patients received standard fluid replacement therapy with crystalloids. Blood samples were collected at 0 hours, 4 hours and 24 hours. Clot microstructure, standard markers of coagulation and inflammatory markers were measured.Results:In sepsis group following fluid administration, the dfreduced initially and then remained stable (1.78- 0 hours, 1.74- 4 hours, 1.73- 24 hours, normal dfrange 1.73 ± 0.04). In severe sepsis group, the dfreduced initially, then increased (1.80- 0 hours, 1.71- 4 hours, 1.76- 24 hours) and in septic shock, the df was very low to start with and there were only slight increase with fluid administration (1.66- 0 hours, 1.68- 4 hours, 1.67- 24 hours).Conclusions:The hypercoagulable state and clot quality in both sepsis and severe sepsis group improved with fluid resuscitation, however despite an early improvement in clot quality, ongoing fluid resuscitation resulted in markedly reduced functional clot with very low clot strength and functionality. This study demonstrates that dfas a marker of clot quality and function may have potential in fluid and component replacement in critical illness and injury.References:1. Davies et al.

In addition, we characterized the potential pro-inflammatory effects of EV-bound CRP on monocytes and endothelial cells.Methods:The association of EVs with CRP was characterized by flow cytometry and Western Blotting. Plasma CRP levels were quantified using ELISA. To deplete CRP, plasma was incubated with Pentrasorb (10 vol%) for 60 min. Monocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with isolated EVs (20,000 g, 30 min). Monocyte IL-8 secretion was quantified by ELISA; the activation of HUVECs was assessed by their expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin using confocal microscopy.Results:Septic plasma (n=30) contained 227.0±88.6 mg/L CRPvs.0.7±0.4 mg/L for healthy controls (n=5).

EVs from CRP- depleted septic plasma induced significantly lower IL-8 levels. HUVEC ICAM-1 or E-selectin expression, however, did not increase upon stimulation with septic EVs.Conclusions:Treatment of septic plasma with Pentrasorb efficiently removes free CRP and detaches CRP from the EV surface, resulting in reduced proinflammatory effects.P473 Extracellular vesicles from activated platelets induce a shift towards proinflammatory monocyte subsetsB Fendl1, R Weiss1, T Eichhorn1, A Spittler2, V Weber11Danube University Krems, Department for Biomedical Research, Krems, Austria;2Medical University of Vienna, Core Facility Flow Cytometry & Surgical Research Laboratories, Vienna, AustriaIntroduction:Circulating monocytes comprise classical (CM, CD14++CD16-), intermediate (IM, CD14++CD16+), and non-classical (NCM, CD14+CD16++) subsets. Changes in subset distribution, specifically a shift towards proinflammatory CD16+monocytes, have been described in various pathologies including sepsis. We analyzed the distribution of monocyte subsets following monocyte isolation from whole blood and the potential influence of platelets and platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on monocyte subset distribution.Methods:Monocyte subsets were characterized by flow cytometry after monocyte isolation by density gradient centrifugation and negative depletion of non-monocytes using two different monocyte isolation protocols (both from Miltenyi Biotec). The association of monocytes with platelets (CD41+) and platelet-derived EVs (CD41+lactadherin+) was assessed by flow cytometry.Results:Monocyte subset distribution was comparable for both isolation protocols (87.5±4.9%vs.83.7±3.3% CM, 4.8±2.2%vs.5.4±2.8% IM, 7.7±5.8%vs.10.9±5.0% NCM for protocol Ivs.protocol II; n=4) and did not differ from the distribution in whole blood. Isolated monocytes contained residual platelets and platelet-derived EVs. Overnight storage of isolated monocytes, but not of whole blood, led to a significant increase in IM (86.4±6.2%vs.50.5±11.8% CM, 5.4±2.6%vs.47.1±13.4% IM, and 8.2±4.2%vs.2.4±2.0% NCM at 0hvs.15h). Flow cytometry confirmed the association of monocytes with platelets and platelet-derived EVs as well as the uptake of EVs by monocytes.Conclusions:Storage of isolated monocytes induces a shift towards CD16 expressing proinflammatory monocytes, which seems to be mediated by residual platelets and platelet-derived EVs.

Calprotectin is released by neutrophils upon their activation and may thus act as a biomarker of inflammation. This study sought to characterize the kinetics of calprotectin and compare them to established biomarkers following intravenous endotoxin challenge.Methods:Healthy male volunteers (n=10, mean age 26 years) were administered a bolus injection of 2ng/kg endotoxin (CCRE, E.coli O:113 EC-6). Blood was collected at baseline, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72hours and 7 days post injection. Plasma calprotectin was analyzed with a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA, Gentian Diagnostics). CRP was analyzed via The Doctors Laboratory, London. Procalcitonin was determined via ELISA (Abcam). Ethical approval was provided by UCL Research Ethics Committee (5060/001). Paired parametric analyses were performed and data displayed as mean +/- 95% CI.Results:Plasma calprotectin concentration began to increase 1.5hours after endotoxin administration, was significantly higher than baseline by 2 hours (356.7ng/mL vs. 737ng/mL, p <0.01), peaked at 4 hours (mean 1373ng/mL, Figure 1) and normalized by 24 hrs. Calprotectin peaked earlier than comparator soluble mediators (procalcitonin 8hrs, CRP, 24hrs) and exhibited 100% sensitivity; all participants demonstrating a minimum 2-fold increase from baseline (mean 3.84x). Calprotectin displayed greater baseline variability (SD 147.9ng/mL) than either CRP or procalcitonin.Conclusions:Our results indicate the potential of plasma calprotectin as a biomarker for bacterial infection. It increases earlier and peaks more rapidly than standard biomarkers. Whilst higher baseline variability was observed, all participants exhibited a significant increase from baseline to peak concentration. Plasma calprotectin warrants further investigation as a tool to permit rapid diagnosis and treatment of infection.Fig. 1 (abstract P474).ResultsP475 An analysis of the prognostic ability of the white blood cell count, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein in patients with septic shockM Chotalia1, M Bangash2, T Matthews2, D Parekh2, J Patel21University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust, Critical Care and Anaesthesia, Birmingham, United Kingdom;2University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United KingdomIntroduction:This study analyses the prognostic"

The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Data was tested for normality and presented as median (IQR) and analysed using a Mann Whitney U test. Categorical data was presented as % and analysed using a chi-squared test. A p value of < 0.05 was used to determine significance. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was conducted using age, APACHE II, charlson comorbidity index, performance status, and initial lactate as covariates. A Hosmer Lemeshow test of >0.05 indicated good fit.Results:474 patients were admitted with septic shock. The majority (61%) were male, with a median age of 64 (55-75) and a 90-day mortality of 37%. On day 1, WBC was lower in patients who died compared to patients who survived (9 [7-15] vs. 13 [9-21]; p = 0.005). NLR (8 [3-16] vs. 16 [5-33]; p = 0.001) and CRP (99 [31-177] vs. 170 [91-266]; p <0.0001) were also lower in patients who died compared to survivors. A low WBC on day 1 (<4) was associated with an increased mortality compared to WBC ≥ 4 (45% vs. 35%; p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that day 1 WBC (OR 0.965 [0.925-1.07]; p = 0.1), NLR (OR 0.99 [0.97-1.01]; p = 0.69) and CRP (OR 0.97 [0.95-1.02]; p = 0.93) were not independently associated with mortality.Conclusions:Patients who died of septic shock had a lower WBC, NLR and CRP response early on compared to survivors. This may represent early immunoparesis that allows infection to propagate unchecked. However, this was not independently associated with mortality when confounding factors were accounted for.References:1. Riché F et al.

Current tests have slow turnaround times, low sensitivities, and/or signals from contaminant or commensal organisms. Empirical antimicrobial treatment may result in severe adverse events and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Diagnostics to distinguish bacterial from viral infections and noninfectious etiologies support clinicians in efforts toward antimicrobial stewardship.Methods:In a prospective, non-interventional study in the EDs of 6 sites in Greece (PROMPT studyNCT03295825), we evaluated HostDx Sepsis, a host response test for suspected acute infections and suspected sepsis. HostDx Sepsis measures 29 human mRNA targets and employs advanced machine learning to differentiate patients with bacterial and viral infections, and noninfectious etiologies. Adult patients presenting with suspected acute infection and at least one vital sign change were enrolled. Whole blood RNA was quantified using NanoString nCounter.

ED clinicians must balance the benefits of early intervention against the risks of indiscriminate use of resource-intensive interventions. There are no currently available rapid diagnostics with acceptable performance to achieve this balance.Methods:We prospectively enrolled adult patients within 5 hours of presentation with signs of suspicion of infection in two EDs in the USA. EDTA-anticoagulated blood was drawn and analyzed using deformability cytometry [1]. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were also measured. Patients were retrospectively adjudicated for Sepsis-3 by physician committee using the entire medical record. Diagnostic performance characteristics and receiver operating curves were used to examine the diagnostic performance of the assay as well as PCT.Results:Of the 190 patients enrolled, 17.4% were adjudicated as septic. The leukocyte deformability assay demonstrated 91% sensitivity, 68% specificity, and 97% Negative Predictive Value for a single cutoff. The AUC was 0.86 (Figure 1). PCT with a cutoff of 0.5 ng/mL had 55% sensitivity, 87% specificity, and 90% Negative Predictive Value. The AUC for PCT (as continuous variable) was 0.8.Conclusions:The leukocyte deformability assay of immune activation signatures demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for sepsis when compared to PCT.

Similarly, microcirculatory impairment has been reported in sepsis. We examine the correlation between microcirculatory disfunction and MRproADM as a sign of early organ failure.Methods:We included 20 consecutive adult patients with suspected infection, sepsis or septic shock admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as first hospital admission with an expected ICU stay of > 24hours. MRproADM was measured daily during the first five consecutive days and sublingual microcirculation was assessed with Incident Dark Field (IDF) technology at T1, T2, and T5. We collected information on SAPS II, APACHE scores, and SOFA score for each timepoint.Results:Ten patients had septic shock, 5 sepsis and 5 infection. Three patients died during ICU stay. A MRproADM clearance of 20% or more between T1 and T2 was found associated with the improvement of MFI (Mann-Whitney U test, median increase 12.35% versus 2.23%, p=0.005) (Figure 1). A MRproADM >1.42 nmol/l at the ICU admission was associated with a worse SOFA score at all the timepoint. Moreover, MRproADM levels at admission was found significantly related with ICU mortality (AUC 0.941 [0.819-1]; p=0.017).

SeptiCyte™ LAB is the first-in-class sepsis diagnostic to gain FDA-clearance but has a complex workflow and a turnaround time (TaT) of ~ 6 hours. The assay in Idylla™ cartridge format is called SeptiCyte™ RAPID.Methods:SeptiCyte™ LAB was translated to the Biocartis Idylla™ near-patient testing platform and analytically validated. For this study, 0.9mL of peripheral blood PAXgeneTMsolution from previously collected patient samples was pipetted directly into the cartridge and inserted into the Idylla™ reader. Patients were part of an independent cohort (N=200) from Intensive Care Units located in the USA and Europe. SeptiCyte™ RAPID results were reported as a SeptiScore™ between 0 and 10 with higher scores representing higher probability of sepsis. Assay performance determined included technician hands-on-time (HoT), assay TaT, failure rates, and Area Under ROC Curve based on comparison to retrospective physician diagnosis.Results:Average HoT was 2 minutes, and average TaT was 65 minutes. Clinical samples could be processed immediately with SeptiCyte™ RAPID and did not require 2 hour pre-incubation of PAXgene blood, greatly improving TaT. Correlation of SeptiScore™ values between LAB and RAPID, based upon a subset of samples run on both platforms, was very high (R2>0.97). Estimated ROC AUC performance for discriminating sepsis from non-infectious systemic inflammation (NISI/SIRS) was similar to that previously reported for SeptiCyte™ LAB.Conclusions:This is the first demonstration of a validated, fully-integrated, rapid, reproducible, near-patient, immune-response sepsis diagnostic, providing actionable results ~ 1 hr, to differentiate sepsis from non-infectious systemic inflammation / SIRS.P482 Accuracy of Septicyte™ for diagnosis of sepsis across a broad range of patientsR Brandon1, K Navalkar2, D Sampson2, R Davis2, T Yager21Immunexpress, Seattle, United States;2Immunexpress, Immunexpress, Seattle, United StatesIntroduction:The purpose of the study was to demonstrate sepsis diagnostic performance of the biomarkers of SeptiCyte™ in subjects other than critically ill adults, and in hospital locations other than ICU. SeptiCyte™ LAB was the first immune-response sepsis diagnostic assay to gain FDA-clearance (K163260) and, as part of gaining this clearance, clinical validation was performed on adult patients admitted to intensive care (ICU) only [1].

Postoperative inflammation is associated with a sepsis like syndrome including endothelial barrier disruption, volume depletion and hypotension. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling lipid regulating permeability and vascular tone. In septic humans decreased serum-S1P levels could be identified as marker for sepsis severity. We addressed three main issues: (1) Are serum-S1P levels affected by cardiac surgery? (2) Are potential alterations of serum-S1P levels related to changes of acute-phase proteins, S1P sources or carrier? (3) Is the invasiveness of the surgery a factor that may influence serum-S1P levels?Methods:46 elective major cardiac surgery patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. Serum samples were drawn pre-, post- procedure and on day 1 and day 4 after surgery. We analyzed S1Pand its potential sources: Red blood cells (RBC) and platelets.

Serum-S1P levels decrease after surgery, whereas all other inflammatory markers increase. Serum-S1P levels dropped by 58% in the on-pump and 31% in the off-pump group. Changes of serum-S1P levels are associated with S1P sources and carriers: albumin, HDL and vWF:AG activity. Patients with a full recovery of their serum-S1P levels after surgery compared to their individual baseline presented with a lower SOFA score (P>0.05) and shorter ICU stay (P<0.05).Conclusions:Serum-S1P levels are disrupted by open heart surgery and levels might be negatively affected by endothelial injury or loss of S1P sources. Low serum-S1P levels may contribute to prolonged ICU stay and worse clinical status. Future studies may investigate the beneficial effects of S1P administration during cardiac surgery.P484 Role of neutrophil CD64 (nCD64) and monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) as newer biomarkers of sepsis management in adult patients admitted in ICUK Pandey1, SS Nath1, M Tripathi1, D Malviya1, M Harjai1, NP Awasthi21Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Lucknow, India;2Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Pathology, Lucknow, IndiaIntroduction:The aim of study is to measure and correlate the expression of nCD64, mHLA-DR, PCT (procalcitonin) and qCRP (quantitative C-reactive protein) to predict development of sepsis and its outcome.Methods:In this tertiary centre based longitudinal cohort study, a total 110 patients were enrolled in whom sepsis was suspected on the basis of clinical diagnosis and supported by lab investigations. They were divided into two groups sepsis/case and non-sepsis/control. Disease severity in ICU was assessed by Sequential organ failure score (SOFA). Blood samples for routine lab investigations and biomarkers were taken at the time of admission in ICU before administration of first dose of antibiotics at time D0/D1.Assessment of biomarkers was done simultaneously with TLC at D0/D1, D3and during follow up of patients till their final outcome.Results:There was no significant (p>0.05) mean change in PCT, qCRP, SOFA, nCD64, mHLA-DR from Day 1 to Day 3, however, mean change was higher among cases than controls.On comparison of mHLA-DR between the groups across time periods, mHLA-DR was significantly (p=0.0001) lower among septic patients than controls at both Day 1 and Day 3. All biomarker correctly predicted cases among different percentage of patients with different sensitivity and specificity. There was no significant (p>0.05) association of mortality with the study biomarkers except for PCT.Conclusions:In our study, diagnostic value of PCT in differentiating sepsis from non-sepsis was similar to nCD64 among all biomarkers studied.

Demikhov City Clinical Hospital, Moscow, RussiaIntroduction:AQP4 is a water channel protein contributing to astrocyte and immune cells migration, blood-brain barrier maintenance and cell survival [1-2]. AQP4 genetic variants represent biomarkers associating with outcome after traumatic brain injury and intracerebral hemorrhage [3-4]. Linking AQP4 genetic polymorphism to the course of sepsis has not been studied.Methods:Study cohort included 124 ICU patients diagnosed according to SEPSIS-3 consensus. AQP4 rs11661256 polymorphism was studied by analyzing PCR products in a 2% agarose gel using an AQP4 specific polynucleotide tetraprimer set. Data were analyzed by log rank test (MedCalc 18.11.3), and odds ratios/hazard ratios were computed. Statistical significance was determined by Fisher test (FT) or Mann-Whitney test.Results:23 of 124 sepsis patients had the minor mutation A for SNP rs11661256 located within the regulatory 3’ region of theAQP4gene.

These phenotypes, biomarker profiles, and outcomes are not yet reproduced in prospective data. Even less is known about the biologic mechanism the drives these distinct groups. Thus, we sought to validate clinical phenotypes and to determine markers of innate immunity, coagulation, tolerance and tissue damage in a prospective cohort.Methods:We prospectively studied patients with Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of presentation at 12 hospitals in Pennsylvania (2018-2019) using automated electronic alerts. Using 29 clinical variables, we predicted phenotypes (α, β, γ, δ) for each patient using Euclidean distance anchored to published SENECA phenotype centroids. Discarded blood was analyzed in a subset (n=160) for markers of innate immunity (e.g. IL-6, IL-10), coagulation (e.g antithrombin III, e-selectin), tolerance (e.g. HO-1, IGFBP7), and tissue damage (e.g. serum lactate, bicarbonate)Results:Among 549 patients,α-type was present in 146 (27%),β-type in 140 (25%),γ-type in 168 (31%) andδ-type in 95 (17%, Figure 1a).

The purpose of this study is to determine the thrombin generation potential of baseline blood samples obtained from SAC patients and demonstrate their relevance to thrombin generation markers.Methods:Baseline citrated blood samples were prospectively collected from 49 patients with SAC at the University of Utah clinic. Citrated normal controls (n=50) were obtained from George King Biomedical (Overland Park, KS). Thrombin generation studies were carried out using a flourogenic substrate method. TAT and F1.2 were measured using ELISA methods (Seimens, Indianapolis, IN). Functional antithrombin levels were measured using a chromogenic substrate method.Results:The peak thrombin levels and AUC levels were lower in the SAC patients in comparison to higher levels observed in the normal plasma (Table 1). The SAC group showed much longer lag time in comparison to the normal group. Wide variations in the results were observed in these parameters in the SAC group. The F1.2 and TAT levels in the SAC group were much higher in comparison to the normal. The functional antithrombin levels were decreased in the SAC group.Conclusions:These results validate that thrombin generation markers such as F1.2 and TAT are elevated in patients with SAC. However, thrombin generation parameters are significantly decreased in this group in comparison to normal. This may be due to the consumption of prothrombin due to the activation of the coagulation system. Thus, persistent thrombin generation with simultaneous consumption of clotting factors such as prothrombin contributes to the consumption coagulopathy observed in sepsis patients.Table 1 (abstract P489).Comparison of thrombin generation parameters and markers in normal and SAC plasma samplesParameters/MarkersNormal Plasma (n=50)SAC Samples (n=49)Peak Thrombin (nM)160 ± 10.7882 ± 40Lag Time (min)2.7 ± 0.204.1 ± 2.05Area Under Curve (nM*min)700 ± 17.76561 ± 283F1.2 (pmol)570.0 ± 48210 ±"

Whether PCT can predict bacteremia and therefore could prevent expenses attached to bloodcultures is unknown . We investigated whether PCT can predict the outcome of blood cultures in the ICU and reduce expences.Methods:A single centre observational cohort study was performed in a Dutch community teaching hospital . Adult patients who were staying in the ICU and were suspected of bacteremia were included. Simultaneously with drawing of blood cultures, samples for PCT measurement were obtained. Expenses for PCT measurement and bloodcultures were calculated.Results:In the study period of one year, a total of 120 patients were included. Three patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Out of the 117 included patients, ten patients had positive blood cultures. There was a significant difference in PCT levels between patients who had positive bloodcultures versus patients with negative bloodcultures (8.01 ng/ml vs 0.71 ng/ml) (Figure 1). The negative predictive value for negative blood cultures is 97% when PCT is below 2ng/ml, There was no difference in CRP levels between the two groups (148 mg/l vs 179 mg/l, p= 0.83).A set of negative blood cultures in our centre costs 35 euros. Positive blood cultures however costs significantly more depending on the micro-organisms found. PCT only costs 8.50 euros per measurement. So when blood cultures are omitted when the PCT level is below 2ng/ml, a cost reduction of 38% can be achieved.Conclusions:A PCT value below 2 ng/ml is a good predictor of a negative blood cultures in ICU patients suspected of bacteremia.

Power of both performed tests with alpha=0.05: 1.0. Log rank test demonstrated better predictive value of cfDNA vs. ocfDNA (Figure). Concentrations of cfDNA, but not ocfDNA, on day 1 significantly positively correlated with maximum SOFA values during hospitalization, day 3 and pre-outcome leukocyte count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios in a limited cohort of NISU patients with TLR9 rs352162 CC genotype and not in other patients with genotype TLR9 CT+TT.Conclusions:Increased level of plasma cfDNA better then ocfDNA predicts sepsis development in NISU. Further studies are warranted to clarify the possible utility of TLR9 rs352162 polymorphism determining for sepsis risk stratification early on NISU admittance.References:1. Chornenki J et al.

The most common infections among patients without and with sepsis were upper respiratory tract infections in 30.2% and 1.2%; community-acquired pneumonia in 6.8% and 28.3%; and acute pyelonephritis in 9.3% and 28.3%. Median HBP was 24.0 and 32.7 ng/ml respectively (p: 0.027). Following analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) it was found that the best discriminatory cut-off for sepsis was 19.8ng/ml. The comparative diagnostic performance of HBP versus qSOFA score is shown in Figure 1. The odds ratio for sepsis with HBP above 19.80 ng/ml was 2.07 (p: 0.001). At the same cut-off point the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the prediction of early death after 72 hours was 100%, 35.7%, 4.1% and 100% respectively.Conclusions:HBP is more sensitive but less specific than qSOFA for the diagnosis of sepsis in the ED.

The hourly, average CBT was computed for 24 h upon ICU admission and discharge in Groups A and C, as well as during septic shock onset in Group B. Cosinor analysis of CBT curves was performed leading to the estimation of mesor (mean value), amplitude (the difference between peak and mean values) and acrophase (phase shift of maximum values in hours). Complexity of CBT signals was evaluated with Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA).Results:No significant alterations in any circadian feature within groups were found, except for amplitude. Controls exhibited increased entry CBT amplitude (0.45 ± 0.19) compared to Groups A (0.28 ± 0.18, p < 0.05) and B (0.32 ± 0.13, p < 0.05).

Some studies indicate that women have better immunologic responses to infections [2]. Later investigations assume this advantage is linked to immune modulating genes located on the X-chromosome [3]. The purpose of this study is to reveal sex differences in incidence of and mortality of sepsis in a large population-based cohort.Methods:64049 adult participants in the HUNT2 study (1995-97) were followed from inclusion through end of 2011. Incident bloodstream infections (BSI) from all local and regional hospitals in Nord-Trøndelag county were identified through linkage with the Mid-Norway Sepsis Register, which includes prospectively registered information on BSI used as a specific indicator of sepsis. We estimated age-adjusted cumulative incidence of first-time BSI and compared the risk of a first-time BSI and BSI mortality in men and women using age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression.Results:During a median follow-up of 14.8 years 1840 individuals experienced at least one episode of BSI, and 396 died within 30 days after"

The alterations recovered within 1 min after end of NP. The effects of NP on CPP, DO2and SssO2were attenuated during the resuscitation period. NP with most impact on SssO2were TS, CP and RM. In septic animals, NP led to similar changes as in controls. Higher SssO2values in sepsis – both before and after NP - were the result of numerically higher cerebral DO2and lower O2consumption (VO2).Conclusions:NP impaired cerebral O2transport similarly in control and in septic animals, but the changes were short lasting and attenuated during the course of treatment. In septic animals, cerebral VO2was numerically lower than in controls, despite numerically higher DO2.P498 Elevated renin and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with vasodilatory shock treated with angiotensin IILW Busse1, C Galloway21Emory University, Department of Medicine, Atlanta, United States;2La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company, Medical Director, Critical Care, San Diego, United StatesIntroduction:Elevated renin is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with vasodilatory shock (VS). Recent data show that patients with VS and elevated renin levels have improved survival when treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) + standard care (SC) vs placebo + SC. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can develop angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) defects that can lead to elevated renin levels and insufficient endogenous Ang II production. We hypothesized that patients with severe ARDS and elevated renin shock would have improved survival when treated with Ang II + SC vs placebo + SC.Methods:In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ATHOS-3 study, 321 patients with severe VS receiving >0.2 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine or the equivalent were randomized to intravenous Ang II (n=163) or placebo (n=158). In a post hoc analysis, we assessed the subset of patients with elevated renin (defined as a renin level greater than the median value of the overall ATHOS-3 population) and ARDS (defined by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300) at the time of randomization. Survival to 28 days was compared between the Ang II group (n=41) and the placebo group (n=61).Results:In patients with elevated renin and ARDS, baseline age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and blood pressure were similar in the Ang II and placebo groups. The median serum renin level was 459.5 pg/ml (IQR: 285.8-1036.0) compared to the normal range for serum renin: 5-58 pg/ml.

Recent data show that patients with VS and elevated renin levels have improved survival when treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) + standard care (SC) vs placebo (PBO) + SC. We hypothesized that VS patients with severe AKI and elevated renin levels would have improved survival and enhanced renal recovery with Ang II treatment.Methods:In the randomized, PBO-controlled, double-blind ATHOS-3 study, 321 patients with severe VS received >0.2 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine or the equivalent and were randomized to intravenous Ang II + SC (n=163) or PBO + SC (n=158). In a post hoc analysis, we assessed the subset of patients with elevated renin (defined as a renin level greater than the median value of the overall ATHOS-3 population) and severe AKI (defined as those with AKI requiring renal replacement therapy [RRT] at baseline). Survival and renal recovery were assessed in patients treated with Ang II + SC (n=45) and PBO + SC (n=60).Results:In patients with elevated renin and severe AKI, baseline age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and blood pressure were similar between Ang II + SC vs PBO + SC. The median baseline serum renin level in the whole group was 352.5 pg/ml (IQR: 115.9-785.4; normal range for serum renin: 5-58 pg/ml). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving Ang II + SC vs PBO + SC survived to day 28 (43% vs 22%, respectively; p=0.03). Ang II recipients also had a higher rate of discontinuation from RRT by day 7 (43% vs 12%; p=0.04).Conclusions:In this study, elevated-renin shock patients with AKI treated with Ang II + SC gained a survival benefit and earlier discontinuation from RRT compared to those receiving PBO + SC. Elevated renin is likely caused by an angiotensin-converting enzyme defect and may identify those patients with a biotype that responds well to Ang II therapy.P500 Machine-learning methods for predicting the progression of sepsis-induced coagulopathyD Hasegawa1, K Yamakawa2, K Nishida3, O Nishida41Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Anesthesiology and critical care medicine, Toyoake, Japan;2Osaka General Medical Center, Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Osaka, Japan;3Nagoya University Graduate"

However,post hocanalyses of randomized control trials report positive results [2], suggesting anticoagulation is effective in specific populations exhibiting coagulopathy. Further, anticoagulants should be administered in the early phase [3]; however, methods for precisely predicting the progression of sepsis-induced coagulopathy are not established. This study aimed to create and evaluate a prediction model of coagulopathy progression using machine-learning techniques.Methods:We performed a subgroup analysis of data from a retrospective cohort study involving adult septic patients in 40 Japanese institutions from January 2011 to December 2013 and used the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score as a DIC severity index test. The predictive ability of ΔDIC ([DIC score on Day 3] – [DIC score on Day 1]) was evaluated using various statistical methods. Using variables available at the outset, we compared the predictive ability of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with that of multiple linear regression analysis.Results:A total of 1110 adults with sepsis were included in the analysis. The Root Mean Square Error in ΔDIC score for the multiple linear regression analysis model was 2.1168 compared with values of 1.6508 and 1.9394 for RF and SVM, respectively. Thus, the RF method predicted the progression of sepsis-induced coagulopathy more accurately than multiple linear regression analysis.Conclusions:RF, a machine-learning technique, was superior to multiple linear regression analysis in predicting the progression of sepsis-induced coagulopathy. This prediction model might enable us to use anticoagulation in an early phase.References:1. Vincent JL et al. JAMA 321:1993–2002, 20192. Yamakawa K et al. Crit Care 23:302, 20193. Hasegawa D et al.

The patients had a mean heart rate of ≥100 beats/min and required catecholamine administration to maintain a mean blood pressure of ≥65 mmHg. The efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients whose heart rate could be controlled within 60–94 beats/min at 24 h of registration. The safety endpoint was the incidence of adverse events within 168 h of registration. Subgroup analyses of efficacy and safety were performed after stratifying the patients according to various patient background characteristics.Results:A total of 151 patients were randomized, 76 to landiolol and 75 to the control group. The efficacy endpoint, percentage of patients with a heart rate of 60–94 beats/min at 24 h of registration, was significantly higher in the landiolol group (54.7% vs 33.3%; Mantel–Haenszel test: p = 0.0031). The incidence of adverse events was 63.6% and 59.5% in the landiolol and control groups, respectively, and there was no difference between the two groups. Most adverse events were related to sepsis or septic shock. The subgroup analyses showed that no patient background characteristic clearly affected the efficacy and safety of landiolol.Conclusions:Landiolol is a well tolerated and effective therapeutic agent for controlling heart rate in patients with sepsis-related tachyarrhythmias; its safety and efficacy were not affected by the patient background characteristics investigated.P502 Tissue oxygenation monitoring in sepsisR Marinova, AT TemelkovUMHAT Alexandrovska, Anesthesiology and intensive care, Sofia, BulgariaIntroduction:Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) was proposed as a concept in the end of 20th century.

The aim of the study is to compare noninvasive tissue oxygenation monitoring with hemodinamic monitoring and lactate values in patients with sepsisMethods:The study includes 19 critically ill patients in ICU of UMHAT Alexandrovska, Sofia. 10 of the patients fullfil the criteria for septic state. The other 9 patients do not have sepsis. In both group of patients are measured tissue oxygenation with INVIOS monitor, mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation in mixed venous blood and lactate values during 72 h after ICU admission.Results:Patients with sepsis are reported with significantly lower values of tissue oxygenation, compared to patients without sepsis. The values of tissue oxygenation correlate well with the mixed venous blood oxygenation, mean arterial pressure and lactate values but not significantly with APACHE scores.Conclusions:NIRS when used for tissue oxygenation monitoring correlates well with the hemodinamic monitoring and lacate values in patients with sepsis and could be used as an noninvasive monitoring for guiding teurapeutic strategies. Tissue oxygenation monitoring has no linear correlation with the severity of illness in patients with sepsis and could not be reccomended as a guidance in the early ressuscitating stage of sepsis. Further investiganions in these field are needed.P503 Digital phenomenology of early sepsis careEB Brant1, JN Kennedy1, IJ Barbash2, CH Chang3, DC Angus1, CW Seymour11University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Pittsburgh, United States;2University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Pittsburgh, United States;3University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Biostatistics, Pittsburgh, United StatesIntroduction:Digitization of health data enables development of virtual care providers. In early sepsis care, development of such technologies, through reinforcement learning and other strategies, first requires understanding the sequence of vital sign or laboratory measurements and treatments. Thus, we explored patterns of data availability and intravenous (IV) fluid/vasopressor administration in a sepsis cohort.Methods:We analyzed a retrospective cohort of electronic health records from adult sepsis patients at 12 UPMC hospitals from 2010 to 2014. We defined Sepsis-3 by i.) suspected infection (e.g., administration of antibiotics or body fluid culture) & ii.) organ dysfunction (e.g., 2 or more SOFA points) in the first 6 hours of care. Data were organized by hour and included vital signs, lab values, and treatments (e.g., total hourly IV fluids (mL) and norepinephrine equivalent dose).

During Hour 1, vital signs were measured in 70% (n=49,890), lab values (e.g. complete blood count) in 51% (n= 36,348), fluid culture in 46% (n=32,785) and serum lactate in 10% (n=7,172, Fig1A). By Hour 6, most patients had vital signs (99%; n=70,559), basic labs (88%; n=62,719), fluid cultures (94%, n= 66,995), while serum lactate was completed in 24% (n=17,818). These data contributed to Sepsis-3 criteria in Hour 1 in 78% (n=55,592) and 100% by hour 5 (Fig1B). Amidst this changing background, IV fluids were given in 17% (mean volume, 166 mL [SD, 411]) and vasopressors in 1% (n=712) in Hour 1. By Hour 6, all received fluids, (mean volume, 1170 mL [SD, 979]), and 80% (n=57,018) received a vasopressor (Fig1C).Conclusions:Early sepsis care patterns are variable.

Two/three-way RM-ANOVA or mixed-effects analysis, and Studentttests were performed.Results:NPT in controls had no effect. After sepsis induction, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 15 (7-22) mmHg, cardiac output (CO) by 1.3 (0.7-2.2) L/min, and arterial lactate increased by 0.2 (0.1-0.5) mmol/L. Sepsis and resuscitation was associated with increasing hepatic and renal arterial flows (p≤0.002, both), and increasing prothrombin time [max. increase 1.4 (0.3-2.9) sec], aspartate aminotransferase [max. increase 70 (49-79) IU] and creatinine [max. increase 72 (59-85) μmol/L; all p≤0.005]. MAP, CO, or hepatic/renal hemodynamics and functions were not affected by NPT. Nevertheless, NPT in sepsis resulted in numerically less noradrenaline administration (0.3±0.3 ug/min/kg in sepsis with NPT vs. 0.8±0.7 ug/min/kg without NPT, p=0.310) and positive fluid balance (2.8±0.4 ml/h/kg with NPT vs. 3.1±0.4 ml/h/kg without, p=0.241).Conclusions:In our experimental fecal peritonitis model, NPT did neither impair splanchnic hemodynamics nor abdominal organ function.

The inadequate response of the immune system to the infection triggers a potent inflammatory cascade, where the C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is an essential key in the amplification and maintenance of this cascade. The gene encoding to CRP is located on the proximal long arm of human chromosome 1 (1q32).

The rs2794521 polymorphism was analyzed by the Sequenom´s MassARRAY platform and a recessive inheritance model was selected (CC vs TT/CT).Results:The possible association between the CC recessive form of the rs279451 polymorphism and the septic shock risk was analyzed, demonstrating a statistically significant relationship (p=0.02) between both conditions. Among patients who developed septic shock, 79.2% presented a recessive inheritance pattern while 54.5% showed the CT/TT genotype. On the other hand, those patients with the recessive form of the rs279451 polymorphism were selected and a statistical analysis was performed comparing those patients who developed septic shock from those who did not develop it, obtaining a statistically significant relationship (p=0.036) between the presence of the recessive form of polymorphism and the likelihood of developing septic shock.Conclusions:The recessive form of rs279451 polymorphism is a risk factor for septic shock in post-operative patients of major abdominal surgery.P506 A novel protein-binding RNA aptamer, Apta-1 - a new therapeutic tool to combat sepsisL Jedlina1, O Olin1, A Bylock1, V Casslén1, M Eriksson2, M Brewinska-Olchowik3, K Piwocka3, M Lindstam11Aptahem AB, Malmo, Sweden;2Section of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden;3Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental biology PAS, Warsaw, PolandIntroduction:Sepsis remains one of the major causes of morbidity with mortality rates as high as 50 % worldwide, representing significant clinical challenge to confront highly intangible therapeutic needs. RNA-based structures are emerging as versatile tools encompassing a variety of functions capable to bypass the current protein- and cell-based therapies. RNA aptamers act as disease-associated protein antagonists. Here, the effects of an aptamer, Apta-1, were evaluated in animal models that mimic systemic inflammation in humans.Methods:High dose of LPS endotoxin was used to induce systemic inflammation in mice and in non-human primate animal models. Apta-1 was administered intravenously in two doses post LPS infection. Animals were monitored and blood samples collected up to 72 hours after Apta-1 administration. Healthy- and LPS-only treated animals served as control groups. Complex analyses of clinical parameters, hematology, serum biochemistry, inflammation and tissue damage markers were performed.Results:Apta-1 increased survival of endotoxin challenged animals up to 80% in a dose-dependent manner and exerted profound effects on well-being and"

Our aim was to investigate the consequences of post-treatment with inhaled CH4in a clinically relevant intra-abdominal sepsis model.Methods:Anesthetized minipigs were subjected to fecal peritonitis (0.6 g/kg, 5-9x106CFU i.p.; n=22) or sham-operation (sterile saline i.p; n=5). Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with blood gas analyses was started between 16-24 hours, organ dysfunction parameters (PaO2/FiO2ratio; mean arterial pressure; lactate, bilirubin, creatinine; urine output and platelet counts) were determined according to a modified porcine-specific Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (ps-SOFA) score system, the perfusion rate (PR) of sublingual microcirculation was measured by incident dark field illumination imaging. The animals were divided into non-treated septic or septic shock groups (n=6-6) and CH4-treated septic or septic shock (n=5-5) subgroups, CH4inhalation started from the 18th hr (2.2% CH4in normoxic air; 500 mL/min).Results:Despite the standardized induction, heterogeneous severity of organ damage was evolved. In septic and septic shock groups the median values of ps-SOFA score reached 5 (4.75-5.65) and 13 (11.75-14), respectively. Septic shock was characterized by significant elevations of creatinine and bilirubin levels, while the platelet count decreased (from 332 to 76 *109/L). Inhalation of CH4increased the sublingual PR by 22% in the septic group, the creatinine and bilirubin levels were decreased by 28% and 80%, respectively. CH4post-treatment significantly decreased the ps-SOFA score (to 1; 0.5-2.75) and resulted in lower values in septic shock group (to 10; 9.5-12.4).Conclusions:Methane post-treatment effectively influences sepsis-related end organ dysfunction.

Yet, the association between limb and digit threat and the intensity, duration, and pattern of vasopressor exposure are unknown.Methods:We studied adults (2010-2014) at 12 hospitals in an integrated health system who met criteria for Sepsis-3. We identified the time to clinically apparent limb or digit threat using clinical adjudication among those with vasopressor-dependent sepsis (i.e. >1 hour of vasopressors at sepsis onset) who had a surgical evaluation within 28-days of sepsis onset. We defined daily vasopressor intensity as 0 to 4 vasopressors administered. Then, we created a time-dependent model for threat with mortality as a competing risk with a weight function to estimates the varying contribution of vasopressors over time. We determined the sub-distribution hazard (SH) ratio of threat for various patterns of vasopressor exposure and intensity, adjusted for age, baseline risk factors, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at sepsis onset.Results:Of 110,621 adults with sepsis, 13,147 (12%) were vasopressor-dependent (age, 66 [IQR, 56-77]; 7,040 [54%] males; max SOFA score, 8 [SD 5]). Of these, 3,664 (28%) died and 117 (0.9%) had evaluations for limb or digit threat 4 [IQR, 1-8] days after sepsis onset. The model-based weight function showed the contribution of vasopressors to threat was stable over time (Fig 1A). Overall, a 1 unit increase in cumulative vasopressor exposure was associated with risk of threat (SH ratio, 2.60 [95%CI, 1.60-4.23], p<.001). For various patterns of vasopressor exposure, greater intensity associated with increased risk of threat (Fig 1B).

Public awareness is important for early recognition of sepsis and improvement of outcomes [2]. We aimed to evaluate sepsis awareness among different groups of people.Methods:Prospective paper-based surveys were issued between 1st July and 1st August 2019 to patients, the relatives of the patiens, hospital staff and general public who gave consent to participate in the study. The questionnaire included ten questions about demographic informations, occupational informations of hospital stuff and sepsis awareness.Results:A total of 588 participated in the survey. Of these participants, 87 (14.3%) were patients, 50 (8.5%) were relatives of patients, 134 (22.8%) were physicians, 125 (21.3%) were medical students, 49 (8.3%) were nurses, 51 (8.7%) were other hospital stuff and 92 (%15.6) were other people.

Blood samples were collected before i.v. administration of 1 g standard dose of paracetamol (t0), at 30 minutes (t1) and 2 hours (t2) after the infusion, to measure drug plasma levels. An analysis of polymorphisms was conducted.Results:The prevalence of the polymorphisms was 36% for UGT1A1p and 8% for CYP3A5p. Peak plasmatic levels in patients with CYP3A5p were higher than wild type(WT) and UGT1A1p at t1(17.6[16.2-21.7] vs 11.4[9.1-14.3] and 10.5[9.3-13.1]mcg/ml; p=0.03 and 0.02 respectively). No significant differences were founded on t2 (Fig.1A). Notably, the three groups received a comparable pro kg dose of acetaminophen. No difference was found between groups in term of toxic effects. Patients carrying the CYP3A5p showed a more pronounced effect on body temperature in respect of WT and UGT1A1p with a delta t° of -0.85[-1.65—0.02] vs -0.4[-0.8—0.05] and -0.45[0.65—0.1]°C respectively, but it does not reach statistical significance (Fig.1B). Only 50% of the patients reach a temperature <38°C at t2 and only 20% <37.5°C.Conclusions:Polymorphisms in enzymes involved in the metabolism of acetaminophen are relatively common.

Prior work proposed clinical phenotypes of sepsis at presentation. However, little is known about how those phenotypes change over time. We explored trajectories of clinical sepsis phenotypes for 24hrs after presentation and contribution of phenotype cohesiveness to subsequent transitions.Methods:We analyzed a retrospective cohort of adult patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria within 6hrs of presentation using electronic health data from 12 hospitals in a large health system in Pennsylvania. We predicted clinical phenotypes at 6-hr intervals over 24hrs using Euclidean distance anchored to previously published cluster centroids (α,ß,y,∂). We determined phenotype cohesiveness using probability of assignment at presentation, defining core members as ≥90% and marginal as <90% probability. We determined how members transitioned to other phenotypes over 24hrs using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plots and determined the odds (95%CI) of transition.Results:We studied 37,198 adult sepsis encounters (median age 69, [IQR 57-81]; 51% male, median SOFA at arrival 3, [IQR 2-4]) hospitalized for at least 24hrs. At presentation, encounters were 28% α-type, 30% ß-type, 28%y-type, and 14% ∂-type. Phenotype was unchanged over 24hrs among 68% of encounters. Transitions were most common for ∂-type (20% core, 57% marginal) and least common for α-type (11% core, 39% marginal, Figure 1A). Core members were less likely to transition than marginal members for all phenotypes (p<0.01, Figure 1B,1C) The odds of ever transitioning from presenting phenotype increased significantly for marginal members vs. core for all phenotypes (α: OR 5.3, 95%CI 4.7-6.0; ß: OR 2.9, 95%CI 2.6-3.2;y: OR 3.6 95%CI 3.2-3.9, ∂: OR 5.2, 95%CI 4.6-5.9, p<0.01 for all).Conclusions:More than half of patients had stable clinical sepsis phenotypes for 24hrs after presentation.
