In fact, injuries occur in patterns that are predictableand preventable. The expression \"an accident waiting tohappen\" is both paradoxical and premonitory. There arehigh-risk individuals and high-risk environments. In com-bination, they provide a chain of events that can result intrauma. With the changing perspective in today's healthcare from managing illness to promoting wellness, injuryprevention moves beyond promoting good health to takeon the added dimension of reducing health care costs.\n\nPrevention is timely. Doctors who care for injured in-dividuals have a unique opportunity to practice effective,preventive medicine. Although the true risk takers may berecalcitrant about any and all prevention messages, manypeople who are injured through ignorance, carelessness,or temporary loss of self-control may be receptive to in-formation that is likely to reduce their future vulnerability.Each doctor-patient encounter is an opportunity to re-duce trauma recidivism. This is especially true for surgeonswho are involved daily during the period immediately afterinjury, when there may be opportunities to truly changebehavior. The basic concepts of injury prevention andstrategies for implementation through traditional publichealth methods are included in this appendix.\n\nClassification of Injury Prevention\n\nPrevention can be considered as primary, secondary, ortertiary. Primary prevention refers to elimination of thetrauma incident completely. Examples of primary preven-tion measures include stoplights at intersections, windowguards to prevent toddlers from falling, swimming poolfences to keep out nonswimmers and prevent drowning,DU1 laws, and safety caps on medicines to prevent inges-tions.\n\nSecondary prevention accepts the fact that an injurymay occur, but serves to reduce the severity of the injurysustained. Examples of secondary prevention includesafety belts, airbags, motorcycle and bicycle helmets, andplayground safety surfaces.\n\nTertiary prevention involves reducing the conse-quences of the injury after it has occurred. Trauma sys-tems, including the coordination of emergency medical\n\nservices, identification of trauma centers, and the integra-tion of rehabilitation services to reduce impairment, con-stitute efforts at tertiary prevention."

    "full_text": "In the early 1970s, Haddon described a useful approach toprimary and secondary injury preven tion that is nowknown as the Haddon matrix. According to Haddon's con-ceptual framework, there are three principal factors in in-jury occurrence: the injured person (host), the injurymechanism (eg, vehicle, gun), and the environment inwhich the injury occurs. There are also three phases dur-ing which injury and its severity can be modified: the pre-event phase, the event phase (injury), and the post-eventphase. Table A-1 outlines how the matrix serves to iden-tify opportunities for injury prevention and can be ex-trapolated to address other injury causes. The adoption ofthis structured design by the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration resultedin a sustained reduction inthe fatality rate per vehicle mile driven over the past twodecades.\n\nThe Four Es of Injury Prevention\n\nInjury prevention can be directed at human factors (be-ha vioral issues), vectors of injury, and/or environmentalfactors and implemented according to the four Es of in-jury prevention:\n\n● Education● Enforcement● Engineering● Economics (incentives)\n\nEducation is the cornerstone ofinjury prevention. Ed-ucational efforts are relatively simple to implement; theypromote the development of constituencies and serve tobring the issue before the public. Without an informed andactivist public, subsequent legislative efforts (enforcement)are likely to fail. Education is based on the premise that\n\n280 APPENDIX A ● Injury Prevention\n\nTABLE A-1 ■ Haddon's Factor-Phase Matrix for Motor Vehicle Crash PreventionPRE-EVENTEVENTPOST-EVENTHostAvoidance of alcohol useUse of safety beltsCare delivered by bystanderVehicleAntilock brakesDeployment of air bagAssessment of vehicle characteristics that may have contributed to eventEnvironmentSpeed limiImpact-absorbing barriersAccess t trauma system\n\nknowledge supports a change in behavior. Although attrac-tive in theory, education in injury prevention has been dis-appointing in practice. Yet it provides the underpinning forimplementation of subsequent strategi es, such as that to re-duce alcohol-related crash deaths. Mothers Against DrunkDriving is an organization that exemplifies the effective useof a primary education strategy to reduce alcohol-relatedcrash deaths. Through their ef forts, an inf ormed andaroused public facilitated the enactment� of stricter drunk-driving laws, resulting in a decade of reduced alcohol-related vehicle fatalities. For education to work, it must bedirected at the appropriate target group, it must be persist-ent, and it m ust be linked to other approaches."

    "full_text": "Enforcement is a useful part of any effective injury-prevention strategy because, regardless of the type oftrauma, there always are individuals who resist the changesneeded to improve outcome even if the improved out-come is their own. Where compliance with injury preven-tion efforts lags, legislation that mandates certain behavioror declares certain behaviors illegal often results in dramaticdifferences. For example, safety belt and helmet laws resultedin measurable i.ncreases in usage when educational pro-grams alone had minimal effecl.\n\nEngineering, often more expensive at first., clearly hasthe greatest long-term benefits. Despite proven effectiveness,engineering advances may require concomitant legislativeand enforcement initia tives, enabling implementation on alarger scale. Adoption of air bags is a recent example of theapplication of advances in technology combined with fea-tures of enforcement. Other advances in highway design andsafety have added tremendously to the margin of safetywhile driving.\n\nEconomic incentives, when used for the correct pur-poses, are quite effective. For example, the linking of federalhighway filnds to the passage of motorcycle helmet laws mo-tivated the states to pass such laws and enforce the wearingof helmets. This resulted in a 30% reduction in fatalitiesfrom head injuries. Although this economic incentiveis nolonger in effect, and rates of deaths from head injuries havereturned to their previous levels in states that have reversedtheir helmet statutes, the association between helmet laws\n\nand reduced fatalities confirmed the utility of economic in-centives in injury prevention. Insurance companies haveclear data on risk-taking behavior patterns, and the pay-ments from insurance trusts, consequently, provide relateddiscount premi ums.\n\nDeveloping an Injury PreventionProgr am The Public Approach\n\nThere are five basic steps to developing an injury preventionprogram: define the problem, define the causes andrisk fac-tors, develop and test interventions, implement injury-prevention str ategies, and evaluate the impact.\n\nThe first step is a basic one: define the problem. This mayappear self -evident, but both the magnitude and commu-nity impact of trauma can be elusive unless reliable data areavailable. Population-based data on injury incidence are es-sential to identify the problem and provide a baseline fordetermining the impact of subsequent efforts at injury pre-vention. Information from death certificates, hospitaland/or emergency department discharge statistics, andtrauma registry printouts are, collectively, good places tostart. Whereas sentinel events in a community may identifyan individual trauma problem and raise public concern,high-profile problems do not lend themselves to effectiveinjury prevention unless they are part of a larger docu-mented injury-control issue.\n\nDEFINE CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS"
  },
  {
    "full_text": "DEFINE CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS\n\nAfter a trauma problem is identified, its causes and risk fac-tors must be defined. The problem may need to be studiedto determine what kinds of injuries are involved and where,when, and why they occur. Injury-prevention strategies maybegin to emerge with this additional inf ormation. Sometrauma problems vary from community to community;\n\nhowever, there are certain risk factors that are likely to re-main constant across situations and socioeconomic bound-aries. Abuse of alcohol and other drugs is an example of acontributing factor that is likely to be pervasive regardlessof whether the trauma is blunt or penetrating, the locationis the inner city or the suburbs, and whether fatality or dis-ability occurs. Data are most meaningful when the injuryproblem is compared between populations with and with-out defined risk factors. In many instances, the injured peo~ple may have multiple risk factors, and clearly definedpopulations may be difficult to sort out. In such cases, it isnecessary to control for the conf ounding variables.\n\nThe next step is to develop and test interventions. This is thetime for pilot programs to test intervention effectiveness.Rarely is an intervention tested without some indication thatit will work. lt is important to consider the views and valuesof the community if an injury prevention program is to beaccepted. End points must be defined up front, and out-comes reviewed without bias. It is sometimes not possible todetermine the eflectiveness of a test program, especially ifitis a small-scale trial intervention. For example, a public in-formation program on safety-belt use conducted at a school\n\nInjury prevention seems like an immense task, and in many ways it is. Yet, it is important toremember that a pediatrician in Tennessee was able to validate the need for infant safetyseats that led to the first infant-safety-seat law. A New York orthopedic surgeon gave testi-mony that played an important role in achieving the first safety-belt law in the United States.Although not all doctors are destined to make as significant an impact, all doctors can havean impact on their patients' behaviors. Injury-prevention measures do not have to be imple-mented on a grand scale to make a difference. Although doctors may not be able to provea difference in their own patient population, if everyone made injury prevention a part of theirpractice, the results could be significant. As preparations for hospital or emergency depart-ment discharge are being made, consideration should be given to patient education to pre~vent injury recurrence. Whether it IS alcohol abuse, returning to an unchanged hostile homeenvironment, riding a motorcycle without wearing head protection, or smoking while refu-eling the car, there are many opportunities for doctors to make a difference in their patients'future trauma vulner ability."

Telephone surveys are not reliable measures to confirmbehavioral change, but they can confirm that the interven-tion reached the target group.\n\nWith confirmation that a given intervention can effect fa-vorable change, the next step is implementation of injury-prevention strategies. From this point, the possibilities arevast.\n\nWith implementation comes the need to monitor the im-pact of the program or evaluation. An effective injury-prevention program linked with all objective means to de-fine its effectiveness can be a powerful message to the pub-lic, the press, and legislators, and ultimately may bring abouta permanent change in behavior.\n\n282 APPENDIX A · Injury Prevention\n\n1.

Impact biome-chanics includes four principle areas of study: (1)understanding the mechanism of injury; (2) establishinglevels ofhuman tolerance to impact; (3) soliciting the me-chanical response to injury; and (4) designing more hu-manlike test dummies and other surrogates. The details ofthe injury event can provide clues to identifying 90% of apatient's injuries. Specific information for doctors to elicitregarding the biomechanics and mechanism of injuryincludes:\n\n● The type of traumatic event (eg, vehicular colli-sion, fall, or penetrating injury)\n\n● An estimate of the amount of energy exchangethat occurred (eg, speed of the vehicle at impact,distance of the fall, and caliber and siz.e of theweapon)\n\nThe collision or impact of the patient with the ob-ject (eg, car, tree, knife, baseball bat, or bullet)"

    "full_text": "Mechanisms of injury can be classified as blunt, pen-etrating, thermal, and blast. In all cases, there is a transferof energy to tissue-or, in the case of (reezing, a transfer ofenergy (heat) from tissue. Energy laws help us understandhow tissues sustain injury. These include:\n\n1. Energy is neither created nor destroyed; however, itsform can be changed.\n\n2. A body in motion or a body at rest tends to remainin that state until acted on by an outside force.\n\n3. Kinetic energy (KE) is equal to the mass (m ) of theobject in motion multiplied by the square of the ve-locity (v) and divided by two.\n\n4. Force (F) is equal to the mass times deceleration (ac-celeration).\n\n5. Injury is dependent on the amount and speed of en-ergy transmission, the surface area over which the\n\nenergy is applied, and the elastic properties of thetissues to which the energy transfer is applied.\n\nThe common injury patterns and types of injuries identi-fied with blunt trauma include:\n\nVehicular impact when the patient is inside thevehicle\n\n● Injury to cyclists\n\n● Assaults (intentional injury)\n\nVehicular collisions can be subdivided further into: (1) col-lision between the patient and the vehicle, or between pa-tient and some stationary object outside the vehicle if thepatientis ejected (eg, tree, earth), and (2) the collision be-tween the patient's organ(s) and the external frameworkof the body (organ compression).\n\nThe interactions between the patient and the vehicledepend on the type of crash. Five crashes depict the possi-ble scenarios -frontal, lateral, rear, angular (front quarteror rear quarter), and rollover.\n\nTypes of occupant collisions include frontal impact, lateralimpact, rear impact, quarter-panel impact, rollover, andejection.\n\nFrontal Impact A frontal umpact is defined as a colli-sion with an object in front of the vehicle that suddenly re-duces its speed. Consider two identical vehicles traveling atthe same speed. Each vehicle possesses the same kinetic en-ergy [ KE = (m)(v2)/2). One vehicle strikes a concrete bridgeabutment, whereas the other brakes to a stop. The brakingvehicle loses the same amount of energy as the crashing ve-\n\n284 APPENDIX B ● Biomechanics of Injury\n\nhicle, but over a longer time. The first energy law states thatenergy cannot be created or destroyed. Therefore, this energymust be transferred to another form and is absorbed by thecrashing vehicle and its occupants. The individual in thebraking vehicle has the same total aniou nt of energy applied,but the energy is distributed over a broad range of surfaces(eg, seat friction, foot to Iloorboard, tire braking, tire to roadsurface, and hand to steering wheel) and over a longer time."

    "full_text": "Lateral Impact A lateral impact is a collision against theside of a vehicle that accelerates the occupant away from thepoint of impact (acceleration as opposed to deceleration).The driver who is struck on the driver's side is at greater riskfor left-sided injuries, including left rib fractures, left-sidedpulmonary injury, splenic injury, and left-sided skeletal frac-tures, including pelvic compression fractures. A passengerstruck on the passenger side of the vehicle may experiencesimilar right-sided skeletal and thoracic injuries, with liverinjuries being common.\n\nIn lateral impact collisions, the head acts as a large massthat rotates and laterally bends the neck as the torsois accelerated away from the side of the collision. Injurymechanisms, therefore, involve a variety of specific forces,including shear, torque, and lateral compression anddistraction.\n\nRear Impact Most commonly, rear impact occurs when avehicle is at a complete stop and is struck from behind by an-other vehicle. The stopped vehicle, including its occupants, isaccelerated forward from the energy transfer from impact.Because of the apposition of the seat back and torso,the torsois accelerated along with the car. In the absence of a func-tional headrest, the occupant's head may not be acceleratedwith the rest of the body. As a result, hyperextension of theneck occurs. Fractures of the posterior elements of the ccr-vical spine-for example, laminar fractures, pedicle tractures,and spinous process fractures, may result and are equallydistributed through the cervical vertebrae. Fractures at mul-tiple levels are common and are usually due to direct bonycontact.\n\nQuarter-Panel Impact A quarter-panel impact, front orrear, produces a variation of the injury patterns seen in lat-eral and frontal impacts or lateral and rear impacts.\n\nRollover During a rollover, the unrestrained occupant canimpact any part of tbe interior ol the passenger compart-ment. Injuries may be predicted from the impact points onthe patient's skin. As a general rule, this type of mechanismproduces more severe injuries because of the violent, multi-ple motions that occur during the rollover. This is especiallytrue for unbelted occupants.\n\nEjection The injuries sustained by the occupant duringthe process of ejection may be greater than when the indi-\n\nvidual hits the ground. The likelihood of serious injury is in-creased by more than 300% if the patient is ejected from thevehicle.\n\n'Types of organ collision injuries include compression injuryand deceleration injury. Restraint use is a key factor in re-ducing injury."

  {
    "full_text": "Compression Injury Compression injuries occur whenthe anterior portion of the torso ceases to move forward, butthe posterior portion and internal organs continue their mo-tion. The organs are eventually compressed from behind bythe advancing posterior thoracoabdominal wall and the ver-tebral column, and in front by the impacted anterior struc-tures. Blunt myocardial injury is a typical example of thistype of injury mechanism.\n\nSimilar injury may occur in lung parenchy ma and ab-dominal organs. In a collision, it is instinctive for the patientto take a deep breath and hold it, closing the glottis. Com-pression of the thorax produces alveolar rupture with a re-sultant pneumothorax and/or tension pneumothorax. Theincrease in intraabdominal pressure may produce di-aphragmatic rupture and translocation of abdominal or-gans into the thoracic cavity. Compression injuries to thebrain may also occur. Movement of the head associated withthe application of a force through impact can be associatedwith rapid acceleration forces applied to the brain. Com-pression injuries also may occur as a result of depressed skullfractures.\n\nDeceleration Injury Deceleration injuries occur as thestabilizing portion of an organ (eg, renal pedicle, ligamen-tum teres, or descending thoracic aorta) ceases forward mo-tion with the torso, while the movable body part (eg, spleen,kidney, or heart and aortic arch) continues to move forward.Jn the case of the heart, shear force is developed in the aortaby the continued forward motion of the aortic arch with re-spect to the stationary descending aorta. The distal aorta,which is anchored to the spine, decelerates more rapidlywith the torso. The shear forces are greatest where the archand the stable descending aorta join at the ligamentumarteriosum.\n\nThis mechanism of injury also may be operative withthe spleen and kidney at their pedicle junctions; with theliver as the right and left lobes decelerate around the liga-mentum teres, producing a central hepatic laceration; and inthe skull when the posterior part of the brain separates fromthe skull, tearing vessels and producing space-occupying le-sions. The numerous attachments of the dura, arachnoid,and pia inside the cranial vault effectively separate the braininto multiple compartments. These compartments are sub-jected to shear stress by both acceleration and decelerationforces. Another example is the tlexible cervical spine, whichis attached to the relatively immobile thoracic spine, ac-"
