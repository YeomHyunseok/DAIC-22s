In a stable patient,the initial ABCDE approach may only take seconds to a few minutes. The ABCDE should befollowed by a rapid history using the SAMPLE approach (Signs and Symptoms, Allergies,Medications, Past medical history, Last oral intake and Events). The SAMPLE history categoriesare described in general below, and essential questions for a specific presentation are listed inthe relevant module. Using the standard SAMPLE and ABCDE approach together ensures thatdifferent providers can easily communicate about acutely ill patients."

Safety consideration involves checking for:\n\nscene hazards. Is there a fire, electrical wire or chemical spill that could injure providers orbystanders? At a road traffic crash, is the scene closed to oncoming traffic? If a building hascollapsed, is it safe to enter? At the scene of an explosion, always consider the possibility offurther explosions. Remember that delayed building collapse may follow explosions, firesand earthquakes.\n\nviolence. Is there a chance that providers may be harmed by the patient or by others? Forpatients who are aggressive or agitated, request help as needed from security personnel orpolice before beginning your assessment.\n\ninfectious disease risk. Is there a possibility for disease exposure (such as flu or haemorrhagicfever)?\n\nYou may not know the cause of illness or injury when you first approach a patient, and withoutappropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), may expose yourself to diseases, chemicalsor poisons. You must use appropriate PPE every time you approach a patient. Always protectyourself from any exposure to bodily fluids. This will almost always require gloves and eyeprotection, and may require a gown and mask. Some circumstances, such as suspected orconfirmed haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, require specific protective practices. Always be surethat you are up-to-date on current local recommendations.\n\nInfectious disease exposure is a significant risk. Use PPE and wash your hands before and afterevery patient contact. At the scene, hand washing may not be immediately possible; carry analcohol gel cleanser if possible. Between patients, clean and disinfect all facility and vehiclesurfaces and all reusable equipment.\n\nDecontamination may be required after exposure to pesticides or other chemicals (dry or wet)and, depending on the chemical, may include washing or brushing to remove the substance.Not all chemicals can be safely washed away, and some must be removed in specific ways toavoid further injury. You must wear appropriate PPE for this. Refer to local decontaminationprotocols for people and equipment.\n\nIf multiple people are injured or ill, call for help or send someone to call."

Because the skull is rigid, the bleeding cannot expand and causes increased pressure on the brain. If the pressure becomes too high, it will prevent blood from entering into the skull and perfusing the brain, and can squeeze part of the brain through the base of the skull, causing death. Any trauma to the brain can cause significant impact on function. • Always remember that head injuries can be associated with spinal injuries. Immobilize the spine and use the log-roll technique to examine the back of the body. • Use the Glasgow Coma Scale (or AVPU in children) to assess and monitor patients with head injury. • Be sure to frequently re-assess ABCDE. • If concern for open skull fracture, give IV antibiotics as per local protocol. • Always check glucose and administer as needed. • Do not give food or drink by mouth. • Plan for early handover/transfer to a facility with specialist care.\n\nREMEMBER… People who initially appear well may have hidden life-threatening injuries,such as internal bleeding.

Difficulty in breathing may suggest that the person has an injury to thelungs, ribs, muscles, chest wall or spine.\n\nIt is usually quite difficult for patients to estimate the volume of blood loss, but it may behelpful to know how long there has been bleeding, how many bandages have been soakedand if the bleeding is getting lighter or heavier.\n\nConfusion after injury may be a sign of head injury, lack of oxygen or shock (with decreasedblood flow to the brain). A head injury can cause bleeding or increased pressure on thebrain leading to confusion, lethargy (increased sleepiness) and coma.\n\nIs there pain? Where is the pain, what does it feel like and how severe is it?\n\nPain is a sign of underlying injury. Headache may suggest that the person has an injury tothe skull or the brain. Pain along the spine can suggest an injury that may progress to causedamage to the spinal cord. Pain in the chest or abdomen may suggest damage to the heart,lungs or other organs. Pain in the pelvis or hips may suggest a fracture in the pelvis whichcan cause serious bleeding and shock. Pain may be the first sign of an internal injury in thechest, abdomen or pelvis.\n\nThis may indicate an abdominal or head injury.\n\nThis may indicate a spinal injury.\n\nDirect trauma to the eye, fractures of bones around the eye, and head injuries can all causevision changes.\n\nCurrently taking any medications?\n\nMedications that affect blood clotting (e.g. aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel) can makebleeding more difficult to control and increase the risk of delayed bleeding.

A greater distance fallenincreases the chance of serious injury. Falls in adults are often associated with older age,alcohol intoxication, or the failure of workplace equipment, including scaffolding andladders. Children often fall from trees, windows or balconies.\n\nWas a pedestrian or a cyclist hit by a vehicle?\n\nAdults and children who are hit by a vehicle while walking or using non-motorized forms oftransport (such as bicycles) are always at high risk of serious injury. Young children may beless able than adults to report events, even major events like being hit by a vehicle. Alwaysconsider the possibility of unwitnessed trauma in young children. Children and adultscan sustain multiple injuries when hit by a vehicle – both from direct impact to the body,especially the lower extremities, and from secondary impact if they are thrown against thewindscreen or road, which may cause injuries anywhere in the body, including to head, neck,chest or limbs.\n\nIn a motorcycle (or powered 3-wheeler) crash, was the rider thrown?\n\nMotorcycles collisions often result in a rider being thrown. Ask if the motorcyclist waswearing a helmet and how far away from the vehicle the rider was found. Common injurysites include head (especially when no helmet was worn), spine, chest, abdomen and pelvis(as the rider hits the handlebars), as well as limbs and skin (as the rider hits the road).\n\nWas there a road traffic crash at high speed? Was the person thrown from or trappedinside a vehicle? Did any vehicle occupants die in this crash?\n\nWith higher-speed crashes, greater force is transmitted to vehicle occupants increasingthe risk of serious injury. Vehicle occupants may be injured by impact with the windscreenor steering wheel, or by the forces that result from the sudden stopping of the vehicle. Aperson thrown from a vehicle is at very high risk of serious injury. If a person was trappedwithin a vehicle it is important to find out what part of the body was trapped (arm/leg, etc.)and for how long. Consider crush injury in a person who has been trapped. A death at thescene of a road traffic crash suggests that there was significant force exerted on the vehicleand its passengers. All passengers involved in the crash, even if they appear unhurt, are athigh risk for serious injury.\n\nIn a motor vehicle crash, was the patient wearing a seatbelt?"
  },
  {
    "full_text": "Some types of injuries are more common in patients who were not wearing a seat-belt(being thrown from the vehicle, head strike on the windscreen, chest strike on the steeringcolumn). However, in very high-speed crashes, seat belts can also cause certain types ofinjuries (cervical spine injury, abdominal injury).\n\nAny time there is a history of a stab or gunshot wound, there may be multiple wounds.Always check the full body for wounds. After a bullet enters the body it may not follow adirect path and can twist throughout the body. Many internal organs can be injured by asingle bullet. A stab wound creates a direct path (it is important to know the length of theblade that was used). Remember that blunt injuries from objects such as sticks and bats cancause damage to internal organs in addition to obvious injuries such as fractures, bruisesand lacerations.\n\nWas there a burn? If so, what type of burn was it?\n\nBurns from fires (flame burns) are the most common. A history of flame burn in an enclosedspace can also suggest an inhalation or airway injury. Scald burns (due to hot liquids) arecommon in children. Electrical injuries often come from high-voltage sources such asoverhead electrical wires coming in contact with the body. On the surface, these electricalinjuries may look small but they can cause extensive tissue and muscle damage. Theelectrical current often crosses the body, taking the shortest path from the point of contactwith the skin to the ground, often leaving entry and exit burn marks. In the case of chemicalburns, information about the specific chemical may be needed to remove it properly.\n\nIt is important to know if the burning process was stopped, and in the event of a chemicalexposure, if decontamination was performed. If the burn is less than 3 hours old and no firstaid was provided, the wound will need to be washed with clean water to stop the burningprocess. If there is a history of chemical exposure, protect yourself from the chemical andensure that it is properly removed from the skin.\n\nDid the person sustain a crush injury? Is there severe pain or numbness? Is there darkurine?\n\nCrush injuries may damage skin, muscle, blood vessels and bone. Damaged muscle canrelease a muscle by-product (called myoglobin) that can build up and damage the kidneys.It is important to know how long a body part was crushed. Even a small crushed area cancause the release of a dangerous amount of myoglobin (for example when a limb is caughtunder falling debris for an extended time). If a person with a crush injury has dark urine, thismay be a sign of build-up of myoglobin in the kidneys. Tissue damage and swelling fromcrush injury can also cause a build-up of pressure (particularly in limb-crush injuries) thatcan limit blood flow to the muscles and nerves (compartment syndrome)."

Lung infection and any severe infection may cause fluid in thelungs. A cough may indicate fluid in the lungs from pneumonia or oedema. Cough andwheezing may suggest asthma or COPD.\n\nIs there foot or leg swelling or recent pregnancy?\n\nDifficulty in breathing with oedema of both feet or legs can suggest heart failure with fluidback-up to the lungs and body.

Peoplecan have severe allergic reactions to almost anything, but food, plants, medications andinsect bites/stings are the most common.\n\nCurrently taking any medications?\n\nAsk about new medications and changes in doses. New medications can cause allergieswith associated difficulty in breathing. Accidental overdose of some medications can stopor slow breathing.\n\nIs there a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\n\nAsthma and COPD often cause episodes of difficulty in breathing.

Heart attack maypresent with difficulty in breathing.\n\nIs there a history of tuberculosis (TB) or cancer?\n\nConditions such as tuberculosis and cancer can cause build up of fluid in the sac around theheart (pericardial effusion) or build-up of fluid outside the lung (pleural effusion), both ofwhich can cause a feeling of difficulty in breathing.\n\nDiabetes can cause diabetic crisis (diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA). DKA causes fast breathingthat may be reported as difficulty in breathing.\n\nSmoking increases the risk of asthma, COPD, lung cancer and heart attack.\n\nHIV infection increases the risk of other infections.\n\nWhen did the person last eat or drink?A full stomach puts the patient at risk of vomiting and possible choking.\n\nWhat was the person doing when the difficulty in breathing started?\n\nAlways consider choking if DIB started while eating or drinking. DIB with exercise might bedue to heart attack, especially when there is also chest pain.\n\nWas the patient found in or near water?\n\nAlways consider drowning (inhalation of water) in a person found in or near water. Even asmall amount of inhaled water can cause serious lung damage, which can worsen over time."

Small children, the elderly and the very ill may be unable to drink enoughfluids without assistance and are at risk of dehydration;\n\nabnormal relaxation and enlargement (dilation) of the blood vessels (with the same amountof blood inside the vessel) can lower blood pressure. This can occur in severe infection,spinal cord injury and severe allergic reaction;\n\npoor filling of the heart can result from blood or other fluid in the sac around the heart(pericardial tamponade), or increased pressure in the chest that can shift and block thevessels returning blood to the heart (tension pneumothorax);\n\nfailure of the heart muscle to pump effectively can be due to a heart attack (vessel blockagethat causes acute heart muscle damage); inflammation or other disease of the heart muscleitself; an abnormal rhythm or valve problems. (Shock due to failure of the heart to pumpeffectively is sometimes called cardiogenic shock.)\n\nThe goal of INITIAL ASSESSMENT is to identify shock and any reversible causes of shock.\n\nThe goal of ACUTE MANAGEMENT is to restore perfusion (oxygen delivery to the organs)and address ongoing fluid loss where possible.\n\nASK: key history findings (SAMPLE history)\n\nCHECK: secondary examination findings\n\nSpecial considerations in children\n\nDisposition considerations\n\nALWAYS START WITH THE ABCDE APPROACH, intervening as needed.

Asevere allergic reaction can cause shock.\n\nB Wheezing can indicate a severe allergic reaction which can cause shock.Shock, difficulty in breathing and absent breath sounds on one side canindicate a tension pneumothorax. Poor perfusion itself can sometimescause rapid breathing when vital organs do not receive enough oxygen.

For how long?\n\nFluid losses through vomiting and diarrhoea can be severe and can lead to shock. Theamount of vomiting or diarrhoea can help give a rough estimate of the risk for shock, soalways ask about frequency of episodes.\n\nHas the person had blood in stool or vomit?\n\nBleeding in the stomach and/or intestines can be severe before it is recognized. A personcan lose a significant portion of his or her blood volume in the intestines. Blood may appearblack in both vomit and stools.\n\nVaginal bleeding may be related to pregnancy in women of childbearing years. Alwaysask about pregnancy status, last menstrual period, any missed periods, or known recentpregnancy. Blood loss from normal delivery or miscarriage can cause shock. A pregnancydeveloping outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) can also be life-threatening if it ruptures.Ectopic pregnancy rupture can occur before a woman even knows she is pregnant. Othercauses of vaginal bleeding are masses in the cervix or uterus.\n\nChest pain may suggest the person has had a heart attack. The muscle damage to the heartfrom a heart attack can reduce its ability to pump blood around the body, which can causeshock.\n\nFever may suggest infection as the cause of shock. Severe infection causes both dilation ofthe blood vessels (which lowers blood pressure) and fluid leakage from the blood vessels(with fluid loss into the tissues).\n\nHas there been any exposure to toxins, medications, insect stings or other substances?\n\nSevere allergic reactions can lead to shock. Additionally, many medications, including bloodpressure and seizure/convulsion medications, can cause shock.\n\nHas there been altered mental status or unusual sleepiness?\n\nThe brain is one of the last organs to be affected by poor perfusion, so altered mental statusmay be a sign of severe shock.\n\nDoes the person have any known allergies?\n\nAllergic reactions can lead to shock by causing abnormal relaxation of the blood vessels."

Always do a careful exam for any signs ofshock.\n\n– Abnormal or noisy breathing can indicate pneumonia as a source for system-wideinfection causing shock.– High sugar levels can result in chemical imbalance (diabetic ketoacidosis) that the bodytries to address by faster or deeper breathing. This condition may also result in sweet or‘fruity’ smelling breath. Since elevated blood glucose levels cause increased urination,severe dehydration and shock can result.\n\n– All external bleeding should be controlled with direct pressure. [See SKILLS] Arterialbleeding may appear as pulsing or high pressure bleeding, and significant blood volumecan be lost in minutes.\n\n– Vaginal bleeding may be an important source of blood loss from pregnancy-relatedbleeding (even in those who think they are not pregnant) or from masses in the cervixor uterus.\n\nIn dehydration states, the patient may feel thirsty or may have dry lips and mouth, abnormalskin pinch, lethargy, and delayed capillary refill.

In a patient who might be pregnant, this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nCheck the urine colour and volume. Small amounts of darker urine may indicate substantialdehydration.\n\nAny significant diarrhoea can cause dehydration.

Then work to address underlying causes. Place IV access rapidly (twolarge-bore IVs) and start IV fluids. Place IV access rapidly (two large-bore IVs), start IV fluids andassess response. Repeat with additional boluses if needed. [See SKILLS] If you cannot place anIV, immediately call for a provider who can place a nasogastric tube (a tube that goes from thenose into the stomach) or intraosseous line (a needle that is placed directly into the bone). Seeif the patient can safely take oral fluids in the meantime.\n\nCAUTION! For severely malnourished or severely anaemic people, or anyone with signsof volume overload, do NOT follow the fluid protocol below. Use adjusted protocol. [SeeSKILLS]\n\nIf vaginal bleeding after delivery (postpartum haemorrhage) is suspected as a cause ofshock: ALL patients need rapid handover/transfer to an advanced obstetric provider. Whilearranging for transport and during transport, it is important to try to stop the bleeding.Give BOTH intramuscular and IV oxytocin. This is a loading dose. After these doses, continueoxytocin IV until one hour after the bleeding stops. [See SKILLS] Bleeding frequently happensif the uterus is not fully contracted (does not feel hard on palpation). Perform uterine massage[See SKILLS] until the uterus is hard. You should use BOTH oxytocin and uterine massage tostop the bleeding. If the placenta delivers,collect it in a leak-proof container andkeep with the patient to allow theadvanced obstetric provider to examine it.Visually check externally for a perineal orvaginal tear. If found, apply direct pressurewith sterile gauze and put legs together.Even if the bleeding stops, these patientsstill need rapid handover/transfer to anadvanced obstetric provider (see figure).\n\nUterine massage for postpartum hemorrhage\n\nUterine massage for postpartum hemorrhage\n\n1.

Attempt to control bleeding while arranging and during transfer.\n\nMassage uterus until it is hard.Give oxytocin IM.Give IV fl uids and IV oxytocin.Empty bladder.\n\n4. Transfer immediately\n\nREMEMBER... fluid only addresses the immediate problem of perfusion. Patients with shockneed rapid handover/transfer to a unit capable of addressing the causes of shock and providingadvanced management, including transfusion."

    "full_text": "REMEMBER... fluid status assessment is critical. Patients who have signs of poor perfusion butoverall volume overload can be particularly difficult to manage. Patients with malnutrition,severe anaemia, and excess fluid in the lungs due to heart, liver, or kidney failure can presentthis way. These patients still need fluids, but the fluids must be given cautiously and, especiallyin malnourished children, according to a specific protocol. [See SKILLS]"
