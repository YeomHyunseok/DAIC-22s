It is: 4 ml fluid X weight in kilograms X total burn surfacearea. Half should be given over the first 8 hours, and half over the next 16 hours.\n\nTapping on the chest wall to assess the lungs. The quality of the sound on tapping may indicatefluid or air in the lungs.\n\nA critical build-up of fluid in the sac around the heart (the pericardium) that compresses theheart and interferes with normal pumping of blood to the body, leading to shock.\n\nEquipment meant to be worn by a person to protect from infection or injury. This can includegloves, goggles, and protective clothing such as aprons or fluid resistant gowns.\n\nAbnormal fluid collection around the lung that can cause difficulty in breathing and even lungcollapse. Common causes include tuberculosis and other infections, heart failure and cancer.\n\nAir in the space between the lungs and the chest wall (pleural space) that causes the lung tocollapse.\n\nBlood clot travelling to and blocking the vessels of the lungs. The most common source is the legs.\n\nDevice that detects oxygen saturation (the percentage of red blood cells saturated withoxygen).\n\nA virus that is transmitted through animal bites that affects the brain and nerves and can causealtered mental status.\n\nPain that occurs when releasing pressure on the abdomen (as opposed to when pressing onthe abdomen).\n\nTime-sensitive interventions performed in an attempt to manage life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe visible pulling in of tissues between the ribs or around the collarbones with strainedinspiration. Retractions are a sign of serious difficulty in breathing.\n\nAn approach to asking key history findings for all patients. SAMPLE stands for: S – Signs andSymptoms, A – Allergies, M – Medications, P – Past history, L – Last oral intake, E – Eventssurrounding the illness or injury.\n\nAlso called convulsions or fits. Abnormal electrical activity in the brain, often seen as alteredmental status with abnormal repetitive movements. Seizures may be a primary condition ormay be caused by infection, injury, toxins or chemical balance problems.\n\nA state where organs do not get enough blood and oxygen (poor perfusion), leading to organsnot working properly.\n\nAn easy way to check hydration status in children by pinching the skin, usually on the abdomen.Well-hydrated skin should return to normal in less than 2 seconds.\n\nA high pitched sound on breathing in that is caused by swelling or a physical obstruction ofthe upper airway.\n\nA wound in the chest wall that allows air in and out of the chest cavity, indicating an openpneumothorax.\n\nOccurs when a pneumothorax causes sufficient pressure inside the chest cavity that bloodvessels collapse (reducing the amount of blood that can return to the heart, and the heartcannot fill or pump enough blood to maintain perfusion of the organs).\n\nDescribes a change in the position of the trachea to either side of midline, a finding sometimesassociated with tension pneumothorax.\n\nThe trauma primary survey is another term for the ABCDE approach in injured patients. Itincludes initial assessment of an injured person and management of all immediately life-threatening injuries, in order of priority. The primary survey consists of the ABCDE: Airway,Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure.\n\nThe head-to-toe (front and back) examination of the trauma patient that includes taking aSAMPLE history. The purpose of this survey is to identify and treat all injuries, with prioritygiven to any hidden life-threatening conditions that were missed by the primary survey.\n\nSitting upright with neck extended but leaning slightly forward with hands on knees. Peoplewith severe difficulty in breathing will often sit in this position.\n\nA whistling sound made when breathing out due to inflammation in the lungs, suggestive oflower airway swelling.\n\nEmergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT).

Monitor closely, always have repeat dose available during transport and caution new providers at handover.Naloxone lasts approximately 1 hour, and most opioids last longer. Monitor closely, always have repeat dose available during transport and caution new providers.Following immersion in water (drowning), a person may develop delayed breathing problems after several hours.

Treat alcohol withdrawal with benzodiazepine. Decontaminate for chemical exposures (eg, pesticides).PAEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONSALWAYS consider unwitnessed toxic ingestionAsk about any medications in the household, and any chemicals (eg cleaning products, antifreeze) in or near the house.Check and regularly re-check blood glucoseLow blood glucose is common in ill young children. High blood glucose can present with AMS and dehydration.AVOID hypothermiaKeep skin-to-skin with mother, cover child’s head. Uncover only the parts you need to see, one at a time, during exam.Danger signs with ingestions • Stridor • Oral chemical burnsMonitor closely and arrange handover/transfer for advanced airway management.Monitor fl uid status closelyPaediatric patients are more susceptible to both fl uid losses and fl uid overload.DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONSPatients with AMS who may not be able to protect the airway should never be left alone. Monitor closely and give direct handover to new provider.Naloxone lasts approximately 1 hour. Most opioids last longer-- always alert new providers that patients may need repeat doses.Hypoglycaemia often recurs. Alert new providers to monitor blood glucose frequently in any patient who has been treated for hypoglycaemia.\n\nMEDICATIONDOSAGEINDICATIONAdrenaline (Epinephrine)Solution: 1mg in 1ml ampoule (1:1000) Adults: 50 kg or above: 0.5 mg IM (0.5 ml of 1:1000) 40 kg: 0.4 mg (0.4 ml IM of 1:1000) 30 kg: 0.3 mg (0.3 ml IM of 1:1000) Repeat every 5 minutes as needed Children: Anaphylaxis: 0.15 mg IM (0.15ml of 1:1000).

Check for pressure spots every 2 hours; padareas with soft material as needed. If >20-weeks pregnant: Tip backboard slightly to the left using a wedge or other materials.• Splint or immobilize fractures to protect soft tissues and decrease pain and bleeding.\n\n• Re-assess the ABCDE approach at least every 15 minutes, including repeat vital signs and glucose checks if patient has beenhypoglycaemic• Control bleeding prior to transport and monitor site for new bleeding• Perform regular re-assessment of any splinted extremity• Continue necessary treatments (e.g. oxygen, IV fl uids, oxytocin, glucose)• Keep the patient from getting too hot or too cold during transport.\n\n• Prepare appropriate size equipment and weight-adjusted dosages of critical medications.• Bring a family member or friend, and tell the receiving facility who is accompanying the child.• Remember that critically ill or injured children can look well initially and then worsen quickly. Monitor closely.• Hypothermia and hypoglycaemia are common in children. Monitor closely.\n\n• Situation: Basic patient information (e.g. age, sex); chief complaint (the patient’s initial description of the problem, such asdiffi culty in breathing for 3 days, or arm pain after a fall)• Background: 2–4 most important and relevant aspects of patient’s case and/or condition; important ABCDE fi ndings/interventions.• Assessment: What you think is wrong with the patient; reason for the handover/transfer.• Recommendations: next steps in treatment plan; potential worsening of the patient’s condition (e.g. need for close airwayobservation if inhalation burn is suspected); cautions regarding prior therapies or interventions (e.g. time of last adrenalinedose to anticipate return symptoms, need to monitor mental status if sedating medications have been given, need tomonitor 3-way dressing for clotting, etc.).\n\nISBN 978-92-4-151308-1\n\nWorld Health OrganizationAvenue Appia 201211 Geneva 27SwitzerlandEmail: emergencycare@who.int"
