Ms. Hughes hasserved as A guiding light for ATLS from ils inception in Nebraska, to its adoptionby the American College of Surgeons, through seven editions published from herdesk over 25 years. Irvene's commitment to quality, devotion to the program, andtireless efforts 011 behalf of the ATLS family were instrumental to the success of thisinternational treasure. We, as her ATLS family, wish to thank Irvene for settingthe example we attempt to follow.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Traumahas taught the ATLS course to over 1 million doctors in more than 50 countries. ATLS hasbecome the foundation of care for injured patients by teaching a common language and acommon approach. The 8th edition was created using an international, multidisciplinary, andevidence-based approach. The result is an ATLS program that is contemporary and mean-ingful in the global community.\n\n-John Fildes, MD, FACSChair, AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURG EONS COMMITTEE ON TRAUMA\n\nThe American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded toimprove the care of surgical patients, and it has long been aleader in establishing and maintaining the high quality ofsurgical practicein North America. In accordance with thatrole, the ACS Committee on Trauma (COT) has worked toestablish guidelines for the care of injured patients.\n\nAccordingly, the COT sponsors and contributes to thecontinued development of the Advanced Trauma Life Sup-port (ATI.S) Program for Doctors. The ATLS StudentCourse does nol present new concepls in the field of traumacare; rather, it teaches established treatment methods.A sys-tematic、 concise approach to the early care of trauma pa-tients is the hallmark of the ATLS Program.\n\nThis eighth edition was developed for the ACS by mem-bers of the Subcommittee on ATLS and the ACS COT,otherindivid ual Fellows of the College, members of the interna-tional ATLS community, and nonsurgical consullants to theSubcommittee who were selected for their special compe-tence in trauma care and their expertise in medical educa-tion. (Please see the listing at the end of the Preface and theAcknowledgements section for names and affiliations ofthese individuals.) The COT believes that those individualswho are resp onsible for caring for injured patients will findthe information extremely valuable. The principles of pa-tienl care presenled in this manual may also be beneficialfor the care of patients with nontrauma-related diseases.\n\nInjured patients present a wide range of complex prob-lems. The ATLS Student Course presents a concise approachto assessing and managing multiply injured patients. Thecourse presents doctors with knowledge and techniques thatare comprehensive and easily adapted to fit their needs. Theskills described in this manual represent one safe way to per~form each technique. The ACS recognizes that there areother acceptable approaches. However, the knowledge andskills taught in the course are easily adapted to all venues forthe care of these patients.\n\nThe ATLS Program is revised by the ATLS Subcom-millee approximately every four years to respond 10changes in available knowledge and incorporate newer andperhaps even safer skills. ATLS Committees in other coun-tries and regions where the Program has been introduced\n\nhave participated in the revision process, and the ATLS Sub-committee appreciates their outstanding contributions. Na-tional and international educators review the educationalmaterials to ensure that the course is conducted in a man-ner that facilitates learning. All of the course content isavailable in other resources, such as textbooks and journals.However, the ATLS Course is a specific entity, and the man-uals, slides, skill procedures, and other resources are usedfor the entire course only and cannot be fragmented intoseparate, freestanding lect ures or practical sessions. Mem-bers of the ACS COT and the ACS Regional andState/Provincial Committees, as well as the ACS ATLS Pro-gram Office staff members, are responsible for maintain-ing the high quality of the program. By introducing thiscourse and maintaining ils hi gh quali ty, the COT hopes toprovide another instrument by which to reduce the mor-tality and mor bidity related to trauma. The COT recom-mends that doctors participating in the ATI.S StudentCourse reverify their status every four years to maintainboth their current status in tbe program and their knowl-edge of current ATLS core content.\n\nThis eighth edition of the Advanced Trauma Life Supportfor Doctors Student Course Manual reflects several changesdesigned to enhance the educational content and its visualpresen tation.\n\nAll chapters were rewritten and revised to ensure clear COV-erage of the most up-to-date techuical content, which is alsorepresented in updated references. New to this edition are:\n\n▶▶ New Sample Trauma Flow Sheet (Appendix D)\n\n▶▶ Disaster Management and EmergencyPreparedness (Appendix H)\n\n▶▶ Skill X-8:Atlanto-occipital Joint Assessment\n\n▶▶ Updated airway management algorithm\n\n▶▶ Updated pelvic fracture management algorithm\n\nYou'll also nole the inclusion of a DVD with this edition.This new course component includes video of criticalskillsthat doctors should be familiar with before taking the-course. Skill Stations during the course will allow doctorsthe opportunity to fine tune skill performance in prepara-tion for the practical assessment. Review of the demon-strated skills prior to participating in the skills stations willenhance the learner's experience.\n\nThis edition features a new full-color design, along with newcolor photographs and medical illustrations. Content waspresented in a narrative format rather than outline for easeof readability. In addition, an effort was made to augmentthe pedagogical features of the textbook to improve studentcomprehension and retention of knowledge. Look for thefollowing features:\n\nThis feature provides a \"road map tothe chapter content\n\nThese questions are aligned with theinstructor's PowerPoint presentations toprepare students for key discussionsduring lectures\n\nSentences appear in red font toattract the reader's attention to keypoints of information.\n\nCross-references to other chapters,Skill Stations, and additional resourceshelp to pull all of the information together\n\nPITFALLTheseboxes highlight critical pitfalls to avoid while caring for trauma patientsCHAPTER SUMMARYChapter thesummaries tie back to the Chap- ter Objectives to ensure understanding of most pertinent chap ter content\n\nThe ACS Committee on Trauma is referred to as the ACSCOT or the Committee, and the State/Provincial Chair(s) isreferred to as S/P Chair(s).\n\n'I'he international nature of this edition of the ATLSStudent Manual may necessitate changes in commonly used\n\nterms to facilitate understanding by all students and teach-ers of the Program.\n\nAdvanced Trauma Life Support� and ATLSⓚ are pro-prietary trademarks and service marks owned by theAmerican College of Su rgeons and cannot be used by in-dividuals or entities outside the ACS COT organizationfor their goods and services without ACS approval.

Assess a patient' s condition rapidly and accurately.\n\n2. Resuscitate and stabilize patients according to prior-ity.\n\n3. Determine whether a patient's needs exceed a facility'sresources and/or a doctor's capabilities.\n\n4. Arrange appropriately for a patient's interhospital orintrahospital transfer (what, who, when, and how).\n\n5. Ensure that optimal care is provided and that the levelof care docs not deteriorate at any point during theevaluation, resuscitation, or transf cr processes.\n\nThe content and skills presented in this course are designed toassist doctors in providing emergency care for trauma pa-tients. The concept of the \"golden hour\" emphasizes the ur-gency necessary for successful treatment of injured patientsand is not intended to represent a \"fixed\" time period of 60minutes. Rather, it is the window of opportunity duringwhich doctors can have a positive impact on the morbidityand mortality associated with injury. 'I'he ATLS course pro-vides the essential information and skills for doctors to iden-tify and treat life- threatening and potentially life-threateninginjuries under the extreme pressures associated with the careof these patients in the fast-paced environment and anxiety ofa trauma room. The ATLS course is applicable to all doctorsin a variety of clinical situations.

Understanding of the principles of disaster man-agement\n\nxviii COURSE OVERVIEW\n\nInjury deaths worldwide were estimated at more than 5 mil-lion in 2000 (Figure 1). The burden of injury is even moresignificant, accounting for 12% of the world's burden of dis-ease. Motor vehicle crashes (road traffic injuries, in Figure 2)alone cause more than [ million deaths annually and an es-timaled 20 million to 50 million significant injuries; theyare the leading cause ol death due to injury worldwide. lm-provements in injury control efforts are having an impactin most developed countries, where trauma remains theleading cause of death in persons I through 44 years of age.Significantly, more than 90% of motor vehicle crashes occurin the developing world. Injury-related deaths are expecledto rise dramatically by 2020, with deaths due to molor ve-hicle crashes projected to increase by 80% from current ratesin low- and middle-income countries. By 2020 il is esti-mated that more than 1 in 10 people will die from injuries.\n\nGlobal trauma-related costs are estimated to exceed$500 billion annually. These costs are much higher if oneconsiders lost wages, medical expenses, insurance adminis-tration cosls, property damage, fire loss, employer costs, andindirect loss from work-related injuries. Despile these stag-gering cosls, less than 4 cents of each federal research dollarin the United States are spent on trauma research. As mon-umental as these data are, the true cost can be measured only\n\nwhen il is realized that Irauma strikes down a society'syoungest and potentially most productive members. Re-search dollars spent on communicable diseases such as polioand diphtheria have nearly eliminated the incidence of thesediseases in the United States. Unfortunately the disease oftrauma has nol captured the public attention in the sameway.\n\nInjury is a disease. It has a host (the patient) and it hasa veclor of transmission (eg, motor vehicle. firearm, etc).Many significanl changes have improved the care of the in-jured patient since the first edition of the ATLS Program ap-peared in 1980. The need for the program and for sustained,aggressive efforts to prevent injuries is as great now as it hasever been.\n\nTrimodal Death Distribution\n\nFirst described in 1982, the trimodal distribution ofdeaths implies that death due to injury occurs in one ofthree periods, or peaks (Figure 3). The first peak occurswithin seconds to minutes of injury. During this early pe-riod, deaths generally result from apnea due to severebrain or high spinal cord injury or rupture of the heart,\n\nFigure 1 Global Injury-Related Mortality.\n\nReproduced with permission from The Injury Chart Book A Graphical Overview of the Global Burden of Injuries. Geneva' World Health Organization Departmento1 Injuries and Violence Prevention, Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health Cluster; 2002.\n\nFigure 2 Distribution of Global Injury Mortalityby Cause.\n\nReproduced with pelmission from The Injury Chan Book.+ A GraphicalOverview of the Global Burden of injuries. Genevat World Health OrganizationDepartment of Injuries and Violence Prevention. Noncommunicable Diseasesand Mental Health Cluster, 2002.\n\naorta, or other large blood vessels. Very few of these pa-lients can be saved beca use of the severity of their injuries.Only prevention can significantly reduce this peak oftrauma-reiated deaths.\n\nThe second peak occurs within minutes to severalhours following injury. Deaths that occur during thisperiod are usually due to subdural and epidural\n\nhematomas, hemopneumothorax, ruptured spleen, lac-erations of the liver, pelvic fractures, and/or multipleother injuries associated with significant blood loss. Thegolden hour of care after injury is characterized by theneed for rapid assessment and resuscitation, which arethe fundamental principles of Advanced Trauma LifeSupport.\n\nThe third peak, which occurs several days to weeksafter the initial injury, is most often due to sepsis and mul-tiple organ system dysfunction. Care provided duringeach of the preceding periods impacts on outcomes dur-ing this stage. The first and every subsequen t person tocare for the injured patient has a direct effect on long-term outcome.\n\nThe temporal distribution of deaths reflects local ad-vances and capabilities of trauma systems. The developmentof standardized trauma training for doctors, better prehos-pital care, and the development of trauma centers with ded-icated trauma teams and established protocols to care forinjured patients has altered the picture. A recent study inCalifornia demonstrated that approximately 50% of patientsdied at the scene or within the first hour, supporting con-tinued emphasis on injury-prevention programs. Both themechanism of injury and the body area injured were im-portant determinants of the subsequent clinical course andthe temporal risk of death. Eighty percent of deaths due tosevere chest trauma occurred within the first 6 hours,whereas 90% of deaths from head injury occurred duringthe first week. The incidence of late deaths was much lowerin this series (8%).\n\nThe delivery of tra uma care by doctors in the United Statesbefore 1980 was at best inconsistent. A tragedy occurred inFebruary 1976 that changed trauma care in the \"first hour\"for injured patients in the United States and in much of therest of the world. An orthopedic surgeon was piloting hisplane and crashed in a rural Nebraska corntield. The sur-geon sustained serious injuries, three of his children sus-tained critical injuries, and one child sustained minorinjuries. His wife was killed insta ntly. The care that he andhis family subsequently received was inadequate by the day'sstandards. The surgeon, recognizing how inadequate theirtreatment was, stated: \"When I can provide better care inthe lield with limited resources than what my children and1 received at the primary care facility, there is so methingwrong with the system, and the system has to be changed.\n\nA group of private-practice surgeons and doctors inNebraska, the Lincoln Medical Education Foundation, andthe Lincoln-area Mobile Heart Team Nurses, with the helpof the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the NebraskaState Committee on Trauma (COT) of the American Col-lege of Surgeons (ACS), amd the Southeast Nebraska Emer-gency Medical Services identilied the need for training inadvanced trauma life support. A combined educational for-mat of lectures, lifesaving skill demonstrations, and practi-cal laboratory experiences formed the lirst prototype ATLScourse for doctors.\n\nA new approach to the provision of care for individu-als who suffer major, life-threatening injury premiered in1978, the of the first ATLS course. This prototype ATLSyearcourse was field-tested in conjunction with the SoutheastNebraska Emergency Medical Services. One year later, theACS COT, recog nizing trauma as a su rgical disease, enthu-siastica lly adopted the course under the imprimatur of theCollege and incorporated it as an educational program.\n\nThis course was based on the assumption that appropri-ate and timely care could significantly improve the outcomeof injured patients. The original intent of the ATLS Programwas to train doctors who do not manage major trauma on adaily basis, and the primary audience for the course has notchanged. However, today the ATLS method is accepted as astandard for the \"lirst hour\" of trauma care by many who pro-vide care for the injured, whether the patient is treated in anisola ted rural area or a state-of the-arl trauma center.\n\nCourse Developmentand Dissemination\n\nThe A'ILS course was conducted nationally for the first timeunder the a uspices of the American College of Surgeons in\n\nJanuary 1980. Canada became an active participant in theATLS Program in 1981. Countries in Latin and South Amer-ica joined the ACS COT in 1986 and implemented the ATLSProgram. Under the auspices of the ACS Military Commit-lee on Trauma, the program has been conducted for U.S.military doctors in other cou ntries.\n\nThe text for the course is revised approximately every 4years and incorporates new methods of evaluation andlreatment that have become accepted parts of the arma-mentarium of doctors who treat trauma patients. Courserevisions incorporate suggestions from membersof the Sub-committee on ATLS; members of the ACS COT; members ofthe international ATLS family; representatives to the ATLSSubcommittee from the American College of EmergencyPhysicians and the American College of Anesthesiologists;and course instructors, coordinators, educators, and partic-ipants. Changes that are made to the program reflect ac-cepted, verified practice pallerns, not \"cutting edge\"technology or experi mental methods. The international na-ture of the program mandates that the course be adaptableto a var iety of geograp hic, economic, social, and medicalpractice situations. To retain a current status in the ATLSProgram, an individual must reverify with the latest editionof the materials.\n\nThe program has grown each year in the number ofboth courses and participants. By 2007, the course hadtrained approximately I million doctors in more than60,000 courses around the world. Currently, an average of40,000 doc tor S are trained each year in approximately 2600courses. The greatest growth in recent years has been in theinternational community, and this group currently repre-sents approximately more than half of all ATLS activity.\n\nA parallel course to the ATLS course is the PrehospitalTrauma Life Support (PHTLS) course, which is sponsoredby the National Association of Emergency Medical Techni-cians (NAEMT). The PHTLS course, developed in cooper-ation with the ACS COT, is based on the concepts of the ACSATLS Program for Doctors and is conducted for emergencymedical technicians, paramedics, and nurses who areproviders of prehospital trauma care. Other courses havebeen developed with simil.ar concepts and philosophies. Forexample, the Society ofTrauma Nurses off ers the AdvancedTrauma Care for Nurses (ATCN), which is also developedin coop eration with the ACS COT. The ATCN and ATLScourses are conducted parallel to each other with the nursesauditing the ATLS lectures and then participating in skillstations separale from the ATI,S skill stations conducted fordoctors. The benefits of having both prehosp ital and in-hospital trauma personnel speaking the same \"language\" areapparent.\n\nINTERNATIONAL DISSEMINATION\n\nAs a pilo1 project, the ATLS Progr am was exported outsideof North America in 1986 to the Rep ublic of Trinidad andTobago. The ACS Board of Regen ts gave permission in 1987\n\nfor promulgation of the ATLS Program in other countries.The ATLS Program may be requested by a recognized sur-gical organization or ACS Chapter in another country bycorresponding with the ATLS Subcommittee Chairperson,care of the ACS ATLS Program Office, Chicago, IL.

Venezuela (ACS Chapter and Committee on Trauma)\n\nThe concept behind the ATLS course has remained simple.Historically, the approach to treating injured patients, astaught in medical schools, was the same as thatfor patientswith a previously undiagnosed medical condition: an ex-tensivehistory including past medical history, a physical ex-amination starting at the top of the head and progressingdown the body, the development of a differential diagnosis,and a list of adjuncts to confirm the diagnosis. Although thisapproach was adequate for a patient with diabetes mellitus\n\nxxii COURSE OVERVIEW\n\nand many acute surgicalillnesses, it did not satisfy the needsof patients suffering life-threatening injuries. The approachrequired change.\n\nThree underlying con cepts of the ATLS Program were.initially difficult to accept:\n\n1. Treat the greatest threat to life first.\n\n2. The lack of a definitive diagnosis should never im-pede the application of an indicated treatment.\n\n3. A detailed history is not essential to begin the evalua-tion of a patient with acute injuries.\n\nThe result was the development ofthe ABCDE approach tothe evaluation and treatment of injured patients. These con-cepts are also in keeping with the observation that the careof injured patients in many circumstances is a team effort,allowing medical personnel with special skills and expertiseto provide care simultaneously with surgical leadership ofthe process.\n\nThe ATLS course emphasizes that injury kills in certainreproducible time frames. For example, the loss of an air-way kills more quickly than does the loss of the ability tobreathe. The latter kills more quickly than loss of circulatingblood volume. The presence of an expanding intracranialmass lesion is the next most lethal problem. Thus, themnemonic ABCDE defines the specific, ordered evaluationsand interventions that should be followed in all injuredpatients:\n\nAirway with cervical spine protectionBreathingCirculation, stop the bleedingDisability or neurologic statusExposure (undress) and Environment (temperaturecontrol)\n\nThe ATLS course emphasizes the rapid initial assessmentand primary treatment of injured patients, starting at thetime ofinjury and continuing through initial assessment,lifesaving intervention, reevaluation, stabilization, and,when needed, transfer to a trauma center. The courseconsists of precourse and postcourse tests, core contentlectures, interactive case presentations, discussions,development of lifesaving skills, practical laboratory ex-periences, and a final performance proficiency evaluation.Upon completion of the course, doctors should feel con-fident in implementing the skills taught in the ATLScourse.\n\nATLS training for doctors in a developing country has re-sulted in a decrease in injury mortality. Lower per capitarates of deaths from injuries are observed in areas wheredoctors have ATLS training. In one study, a small traumateam led by a doctor with ATLS experience had equivalentpatient survival when compared with a larger team withmore doctors in an urban setting. In addition, there weremore unexpected survivors than fatalities. There is abun-dant evidence that ATLS training improves the knowledgebase, the psychomotor skills and their use in resuscitation,and the confidence and performance of doctors who havetaken part in the program. The organization and proceduralskills taught in the course are retained by course participantsforal least 6 years, which may be the most significant impactof all.\n\nThe COT of the ACS and the ATLS Subcommittee gratefullyacknowledge tbe following organizations for their time andefforts in developing and field testing the Advanced TraumaLife Support concept: The Lincoln Medical Education Foun-dation, Sou theast Nebraska Emergency Medical Services,the University of Nebraska College of Medicine, and the Ne-braska State Committee on Trauma of the ACS. The com-mittee also is indebted to the Nebraska doctors whosupported the development of this course and to the Lin-coln Area Mobile Heart Team Nurses who shared their timeand ideas to help build it. Appreciation is extended to theorganizations identified previously in this overview for theirsupportof the worldwide promulgation of the course. Spe-cial recognition is given to the spouses, significant others,children, and practice partners of the ATLS instructors andstudents. The time that doctors spend away from theirhomes and practices and effort aff orded to this voluntaryprogram are essential components for the existence and suc-cess of the ATLS Program.\n\nThe ATLS course provides an easily remembered approachto the evaluation and treatment of injured patients for anydoctor, irrespective of practice specialty, even under thestress, anxiety, and intensity that accompanies the resusci-tation process. ln addition, the program provides a commonlanguage for all providers who care for injured patients. TheATLS course provides a foundation for evaluation, treat-\n\nCOURSE OVERVIEW xxiii\n\nsur gical medical background. Eur / Emerg Mcd 1997;4:1 1-14.\n\nment, education, and quality assurance-in short, a systemof trauma care that is measurable, reproducible, and com-prehensive.\n\nThe ATLS Program has had a positive impact on thecare provided to injured patients worldwide. This has re-sulted from the improved skills and knowledge of the doc-lors a nd other health care providers who have been courseparticipants. The ATLS course establishes an organized andsystematic approach for the evaluation and treatment of pa-tients, promotes minimum standards of care, and recognizesinjury as a world health care issue. Morbidity and mortalityhave been reduced, but the need to eradicate injury remains.The ATLS Program has changed and will continue to changeas advances occur in medicine and the needs and expecta-lions of our societies change.\n\n1.
