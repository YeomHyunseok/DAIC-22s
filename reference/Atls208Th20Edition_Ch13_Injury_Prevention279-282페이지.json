Pregnancy causes major physiologic changesand altered anatomic relationships involving nearly everyorgan system of the body. These changes of structure andfunction can influence the evaluation of injured pregnantpatients by altering the signs and symptoms of injury, theapproach and responses to resuscitation, and the results ofdiagnostic tests. Pregnancy also can affect the patterns andseverity of injury. The doctor attending a pregnant traumapatient must remember that there are two patients: motherand fetus. Nevertheless, initial treatment priorities for aninjured pregnant patient remain the same as for the non-pregnant patient. The best initial treatment for the fetus isthe provision of optimal resuscitation of the mother andearly assessment of the fetus. Monitoring and evaluationtechniques should allow assessment of the mother and thefetus. � x-ray examination is indicated during criticalmanagement, it should not be withheld because of thepregnancy. A qualified surgeon and an obstetrician shouldbe consulted early in the evaluation of pregnant traumapatients.\n\nAnatomic and PhysiologicAlterations of Pregnancy\n\n? What changes occur with pregnancy?\n\nAn understanding of the anatomic and physiologic alter-ations of pregnancy, as well as of the physiologic relationshipbetween a pregnant patient and her fetus, is essential to servethe best interests of both patients. Such alterations includedifferences in anatomy, blood volume and composition, andhemodynamics, as well as changes in the respiratory, gas-trointestinal, urinary, endocrine, musculoskeletal, and neu-rologic systems.\n\nThe ulerus remains an intrapelvic organ until approximatelythe 12th week of gestation, when it begins to rise out of thepelvis. By 2() weeks, the uterus is at the um bilicus, and at 34to 36 weeks, it reaches the costal margin (Figure 12-1). Dur-ing the last 2 weeks of gestation, the fundus frequently de-scends as the fetal head engages the pelvis. As the uterusenlarges, the bowel is pushed cephalad, so that the bowel lies\n\nFigure 12-1 Changes in Fundal\n\nHeight in Pregnancy. As the uterus en-larges, the bowel is pushed cephalad, SOthat it lies mostly in the upper abdomen,As a result, the bowel is somewhat pro-tected in blunt abdominal trauma,whereas the uterus and its contents (fetusand placenta) become more vulnerable.\n\nmostly in the upper abdomen. As a result, the bowel is some-what protected in blunt abdominal trauma, whereas theuterus and its con tents (fetus and placenta) become morevulnerable, However, penetrating trauma to the upper ab-domen during late gestation may result in complex intes-tinal injury because of this cephalad displacement.\n\nDuring the first trimester, the uterus is a thick-walledstructure of limited size, conlined within the bony pelvis.During the second Irimester, it enlarges beyond ils protectedintrapelvic location, bul the small fetus remains mobile andcushioned by a generous amounl of amniotic fluid. The am-niotic fluid may cause amniotic fluid embolism and dis-se.minated intravascular coagulation following trauma if thefluid gains access to the maternal intravascular space. By thethird trimester, the uterus is large and thin-walled, In thevertex presentation, the fetal head is usually within thepelvis, with the remainder of the fetus exposed above thepelvic brim (Figure 12-2).Pelvic fracture(s) in late gestationmay result in skull fraclure or serious intracranial injury tothe fetus. Unlike the elastic myometrium, the placenta haslittle elasticity, This lack of placental elaslic 1 issue results invulnerability to shear forces at the uteroplacental interface,which may lead to abruptio placentae. The placental vascu-latureis maximally dilated throughout gestation, yet itis ex-quisitely sensilive to catecholamine stimulation. An abruptdecrease in maternal intravascular volume can result in a pro-found increase in uterine vascular resistance, reducing fetaloxygenation despite reasonably normal maternal vital signs.\n\nBLOOD VOLUME AND COMPOSITION\n\nPlasma volume increases steadily throughout pregnancy andplateaus at 34 weeks of gestation. A smaller increase in red-blood-cell (RBC) volume occurs, resulting in a decreasedhemalocrit (physiologic anemia of pregnancy). In late preg-nancy、 a hematocrit of 31 % lo 35%다 is normal. Otherwisehealthy pregnant patients can lose ] 200 to 1500 mL of theirblood volume before exhibiting signs and symptoms of hypo-volemia, However, this amount ofhemorrhage maybe reflectedby fetal distress evidenced by an abnormal fetal heart rate.\n\nThe white-blood-cell (WBC) count increases duringpregnancy. [t is not unusual to see WBC counts of15,000/mm3 during pregnancy or as high as 25,000/mm3during labor. Levels of serum fibrinogen and other clottingfactors aremildly elevated. Prothrombin and partial throm-boplastin times may be shortened, but bleeding and clottingtimes are unchanged. The serum albumin level falls to 2.2 to2.8 g/dL during pregnancy, causing a drop in serum proteinlevels by approximately 1.0 g/dL. Serum osmolarity remainsat about 280 mOsm/L throughout pregnancy. Table 12-1outlines normal laboratory values during pregnancy.\n\nImportant hemodynamic factors to consider in pregnanttrauma patients include cardiac output, heart rate, blood\n\nTABLE 12-1 Normal Laboratory Values during PregnancyHematocrit32%-42%WBC count5000-12,000 /LArterial pH7.40-7.45Bicarbonate17-22 meg/lPaCO225-30 mm Hg (3.3-4 kPa)\n\npressure, venous pressure, and electrocardiographicchanges.\n\nAfler the 10th week of pregnancy, cardiac output can be in-creased by 1.0 to 1.5 L/min because of the increase in plasmavolume and decrease in vascular resistance ofthe uterus andplacenta, which receive 20% of the patient's cardiac outpulduring the third trimesler of pregnancy. This increased out-put may be greally influenced by the mother's position dur-ing the second half of pregnancy. In the supine position, venacava compression can decrease cardiac output by 30% be-cause of decreased venous return from the lower extremities.\n\nHearl rate increases gradually, by 10 to 15 beats/min, duringpregnancy, reaching a maximum rate by the third trimester.This change in hearl rate must be considered when inter-preting the tachycardic response to hypovolemia.\n\nPregnancy results in a 5 to 15 mm Hg fall in systolic and di-astolic pressures during the second trimester. Blood pressurerelurns to near-normallevels al term. Some pregnant womenexhibil hypolension when placed in the supine position(supine hypotensive syndrome), caused by compression ofthe inferior vena cava. This hypotension is corrected by re-lieving uterine pressure on the inferior vena cava, as describedlater in this chapter. The normal changes in blood pressure,pulse, hemoglobin, and hematocrit during pregnancy mustbe interpreted carefully in pregnant trauma patients.\n\nThe resting central venous pressure (CVP) is variable withpregnancy, but the response to volume is the same as in thenonpregnant state. Venous hypertension in the lower ex-tremities is present during the third trimester."
