Although uncommon, life-threatening musculoskele-tal injuries must be properly assessed and managed. Most extremity injuries are appro-priately diagnosed and managed during the secondary survey.3 It is essential to recognize and manage in a timely manner pelvic fractures, arterial in-juries, compartment syndrome, open fractures, crush injuries, and fracture-dislocations.Knowledge of the mechanism of injury and history of the injury-producing event enablesthe doctor to be aware of what associated conditions potentially exist with the injuredextremity. Early splinting of fractures and dislocations may prevent serious complicationsand late sequeiae. In addition, an awareness of the patient's tetanus immunization sta-tus, particularly in cases of open fractures or significantly contaminated wounds, mayprevent serious complications. Armed with the proper knowledge and skills, as outlinedin this chapter, the doctor can satisfactorily provide the initial management for mostmusculoskeletal trauma,\n\nVirkelyst C, Hougaard S, Kehlet H.

The examiner needs to askabout characteristics of the injury incident and prehospitalcare. Remember, open wounds may not bleed, but may beindicative of nerve injury or an open fracture.\n\nSTEP 1. deformed which indicative\n\nSplint extremities, are of a fracture or joint injury, before patient transport or as soon as is safely possible.STEP 2.Assess the color of the extremity. The presence of bruising indicates muscle injury or significant soft tissue injury over bones or joints. These changes may be associated with swelling or hematomas. Vascular impairment may be first identified by a pale distal cxtrcmity.STEP 3.Note the position of the extremity, which can be helpful in determining certain injury patterns. Certain nerve deficits lead to specific positions of the extremity. For example, injury to the radial nerve results in wrist drop, and injury lo the peroncal nerve results in fool drop.STEP 4.Observe spontaneous activity to help determine the severity of injury. Observing whether the patient spontaneously moves an extremity may suggest to the examiner other obvious or occult injuries. An example is a patient with a brain injury who does not follow commands and has no spontaneous lower-extremity movcment; this patient coulcl have a thoracic or lumbar Fracture.STEP 5.Note gender and age, which are important clues to potential injuries. Children may sustain growth plate injuries and fractures that may not manifest themselves (eg, buckle fracture). Females are less likely to have urethral injuries than vaginal injuries with a pelvic fracture.STEP 6MObserve drainage from the urinary catheter. lf the urine is bloody or catheter insertion is difficult, the patient may have a pelvic fracture and a urologic injury.\n\n[\"ife- and limb-threatening injuries are excluded first.\n\nSTEP 1. Palpate the pelvis anteriorly and posteriorly toassess for deformity, motion, and/or a gap thatindicates a potentially unstable pelvis. The\n\ncompression-distraction and push-pull testsshould be done only once. These tests aredangcrous because they can dislodge clots andcause rebleeding.\n\n2. Palpate pulses in all extremities and documentthe findings. Any perceived abnormality ordifference must be explained. Normal capillaryrefill (provides a good indication of satisf actory bloodflow to the distal parts of the cxtremity. Loss ordiminishment of pulses with normal capillaryrefill indicates a viable extremity; how.ever,surgical consultation is required. If an extremityhas no pulses and no capillary refill, a surgicalemergency exists. A Doppler device is useful toassess pulses and determine the ankle/armsystolic pressure ratio. Blood pressure ismeasured at the ankle and on an uninjured arm.The normal ratio exceeds 0.9. If the ratio is below0.9, a potential injury exists and surgicalconsultation is required.\n\nSTEP 3. Palpate the muscle compartments of all theextremities for compartment syndromes andfractures. This is done by gentle palpation of themuscle and bone. It a fracture is present, theconscious patient reports pain. If the patient isunconscious, only abnormal motion may be felt.A compartment syndrome should be suspected ifthe muscle compartment is hard, firm, or tender.Compartment syndromes may bc associated withfractures.\n\nSTEP 4. Assess joint stability by asking the cooperativepatient to move the joint through a range ofmotion. This should not be done if there is anobvious fracture or deformity, or if the patientcannot cooperate. Palpate each join! fortenderness, swelling, and intraarticular fluid.Assess joint stability by applying lateral, medial,and anterior-posterior stress. Any deformed ordislocated joint should be splinted and x-rayedbefore testing for stability.\n\nSTEP 5. Perform a rapid, thorough neurologicexamination of the extremities and documentthe Findings. Repeal and record testing asindicated by the patient's clinica.l condition. Testsensation by light touch and pinprick in each ofthe extremities. Progression of the neurologicfindings indicates a potential problem.\n\nA. C5-Lateral aspecl of the upper ann (alsoaxillary nerve)\n\nB. C6-Palmar aspecl of the thumb and indextinger (median nerve)C.

Assess the deep tendon retlexes.\n\nSTEP 8. Assess the palient's back.\n\n▶ Skill XII~B: Principles of Extremity Immobilization\n\nSTEP 1.Assess the ABCDEs, and treat life-threatening situations first.STEP 2.Remove all clothing and completely expose the patient, including the extremities. Remove watches, rings, bracelets, and other potentially constricting devices. Remember to prevent the development of hypothermia.STEP 3.Assess the neurovascular status of the extremity before applying the splint. Assess for pulses and external hemorrhage, which must be controlled, and perform a motor and sensory examination ol the extremity.STEP 4. STEP S.Cover any open wounds with sterile dressings. Select the appropriate size and type of splint for the injured extremity. The device should immobilize the joint above and the joint below the injury site.STEP 6.Apply padding over bony prominences that will be covered by the splint.\n\nSTEP 7. Splint the extremity in the position in which it isfound if distal pulses are present in the injuredextremity. If distal pulses are absent, one attemptshould be made to realign the extremity. Gentletraction should be maintained until the splintingdevice is secured.\n\n8. Place the extremity in a splint if normallyaligned. If malaligned, the extremity needs to berealigned and then splinted. 0 not forcerealignment of a deformed extremity. If it is noteasily realigned, splint the extremity in theposition in which it is found.\n\nSTEP 9. Obtain orthopedic consultation.\n\nDocument the neurovascular status of theextremity before and after every manipulationor splint application.\n\nAdminister appropriate tetanus prophylaxis.\n\nSee Appendix E: Tetanus Immunization.\n\n▶ Skill XII-C: Realigning a Deformed Extremity\n\nPhysical examination determines whether a deformity isfrom a fracture or a dislocation. 'I'he principle of realigningan extremity fracture is to restore length by applying gentlelongitudinal traction to correct the residual angulation andthen rotational deformities. While maintaining realignmentwith manual traction, a splint is applied and secured to theextremity by a n assistant.\n\nGrasp the elbow and manually apply distaltraction.\n\nSTEP 2. Al'ter alignment is obtained, apply a plaster splintand secure the arm to the chest wall with a slingand swath.\n\n208 SKILL STATION XII ● Musculoskeletal Trauma: Assessment and Management\n\nSTEP 1. Manually apply distal traction through the wristwhile holding the elbow and applying♥countertraction.\n\nSTEP 2. Secure a splint to the forearm and elevate theinjured extremity.\n\nSTEP 1. Realign the femur by manually applying tractionthrough the ankle if the tibia and fibula are notfractured.\n\nSTEP 2. As the muscle spasm is overcome, the leg willstraighten and the rotational deformity can becorrected. This maneuver may take severalminutes, depending on the size of the patient.\n\n▶ Skill XII-D: Application of a Traction Splint\n\nNote: Application of this device requires two people-oneperson to handle the injured extremity, and the second toapply the splint.\n\nSTEP 1. Remove all clothing, including footwear, toexpose the extrem ity.\n\nSTEP 2. Apply sterile dressings to open wounds.\n\nSTEP 3. Assess the neurovascular status of the extremity.\n\nSTEP 4. Cleanse any exposed bone and muscle of dirt anddebris before applying traction. Document thatthe exposed bone fragments were reducedintothe soft tissues.\n\nSTEP 5. Determine the length of the splint by measuringthe uninjured leg. The upper cushioned ringshould be placed under the buttocks and adjacentto the ischial tuberosity. The distal end of thesplint should extend beyond the ankle byapproximately 6 inches (15 cm). The straps onthe splint should be positioned to support thethigh and calf.\n\nAlign the femur by manually applying tractionthrough the ankle. After realignment is achieved,gently elevate the leg to allow the assistant toslide the splint under the extremity SO that thep"
