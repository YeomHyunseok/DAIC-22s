With the objective of delivering a PEEP level between 5 and 10 cmH2O, FiO2actually delivered at two target ranges (40–60% and 80–100%) and oxygen consumption were measured for two different simulated patients.An observational clinical study evaluating the Bag-CPAP was conducted in France, including 20 adult patients with de novo acute respiratory failure. Actual FiO2and PEEP as well as oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR) and dyspnea score were assessed.Results:1. Bench study: All systems tested reached the minimal FiO2target range (40–60%) and four were able to reach the higher target range. The ratio between FiO2and oxygen consumption was the highest with the Bag-CPAP and the lowest with high-flow oxygen device whatever the FiO2target.2. Clinical study: The Bag-CPAP was well tolerated and reached the two FiO2target ranges, 53% [52–53%] for moderate FiO2and 94% [93–96%] for high FiO2with an oxygen flow rate of at least 5 L/min and 15 L/min, respectively (Fig. 1). SpO2significantly increased and dyspnea significantly decreased within the first hour of treatment (93% [90–97%] vs. 97% [95–98%],p= 0.001 and 4 [2–7] vs. 3 [2–4],p= 0.017, respectively). There was no significant effect on RR.Conclusions:This study shows that the Bag-CPAP has the highest oxygen saving properties.

We aimed to compare the impact of different intraoperative fractional inspiratory concentration of oxygen on postoperative pulmonary outcomes including oxygenation index and lactate values after thoracolumbar spine instrumentation.Methods:Total 75 American Society of Anesthesiologists I–II adult patients aged 18–60 years who were scheduled to undergo thoraco-lumbar spine instrumentation were randomly allocated into group A: (conservative oxygen) FiO2= 0.30 (30% oxygen with air) and group B: (Liberal Oxygen) FiO2= 0.80 (80% oxygen with air). We aimed to compare the changes in PaO2/FiO2ratio, lactate values, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, PONV and SSI at the different study time intervals.Results:At the end of surgery after extubation, the mean (SD) of PaO2/FiO2ratio in 0.3 FiO2and 0.8 FiO2groups were 424.69 (53.69) and 315.57 (48.62) respectively. The values of lactate in both the groups increased at the end of surgery from a mean of 0.93 pg/ml in both the groups preoperatively to 1.18 pg/ml and 1.74 pg/ml in 0.3 and 0.8 FiO2groups postoperatively respectively. No significant changes in the levels of interleukin 6 and CRP were found in our study when compared between baseline values and the values after intervention.Conclusions:This study demonstrated the superior efficacy of conservative oxygen inspiratory fraction (0.3% FiO2) as compared to liberal FiO2(0.8% FiO2), in terms of better PaO2/FiO2ratio and low lactate values in patients undergoing surgery for thoraco-lumbar spine.P003Effect of non-invasive respiratory support on interstitial lung disease with acute respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysisN Sanguanwong1, N Jantarangsi2, J Ngeyvijit3, N Owattanapanich4, V Phoophiboon51Chulalongkorn University, Department of Physiology, Bangkok, Thailand,2Buddhachinaraj hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Phitsanulok, Thailand,3Chulalongkorn University, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand,4Mahidol University, Division of Trauma Surgery, Bangkok, Thailand,5Chulalongkorn University, Critical Care Medicine, Bangkok, ThailandCritical Care2023,27(S1): P003Introduction:The data of non-invasive respiratory support (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; NIPPV and high flow nasal cannula; HFNC) in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with acute respiratory"

Our study aimed to identify the benefits of non-invasive respiratory support on this patient subgroup.Methods:MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library searches were conducted from 1946 to June 2022. An additional search of relevant primary literature and review articles was also performed. A random effects model was used to estimate the PF ratio, PaCO2, mortality, intubation rate and hospital length of stay.Results:Of 380 studies, 9 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The non-invasive respiratory support demonstrated a significant improvement in PF ratio compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT), the mean difference was 54.58 (95% CI [9.48–9.69]) (Fig. 1). Compared to HFNC, there was a significant increase in PF ratio in NIPPV (mean difference 0.45; 95% CI [0.12–0.79]). There were no mortality and intubation rate benefits when comparing between NIPPV and HFNC, mean difference were 1.1; 95% CI [0.83–1.44] and 1.86; 95% CI [0.42–8.33], respectively. In addition, there was a significant decrease in hospital length of stay in HFNC compared to NIPPV (mean difference 9.27; 95% Cl [1.45–17.1]).Conclusions:Non-invasive respiratory support might be an alternative modality in ILDs with ARF.

The helmet is one of the most comfortable interfaces, even if synchronism is lower due to dead space. The use of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, in which the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) drives the ventilator, has shown improvement in comfort and synchronism but still some limitation with helmet, due to the long pressurization time. pressure-support ventilation (PSV) is still the most used and diffused assisted mode, due to its simplicity and effectiveness in helmet-NIV. We tested a new ventilation software called neural pressure support (NPS), which merges the rapid pressurization of PSV along with the EAdi trigger, on a population of 24 critical care patients ventilated via helmet-NIV.Methods:PSV and NPS 30-min trials were started in random order. A physician expert in mechanical ventilation optimized ventilator setting blinded for EAdi and 2 new 30-min trials were started. Tracings were recorded and the last 2 min of each analyzed. As primary endpoint we evaluated TimeSync, defined as the time during which both EAdi and Flow tracings were in the inspiratory phase.

Tidal volume measurement was based on helmet outflow-trace analysis. Helmet inflow was increased from 60 to 75 and 90 L/min to match patients’ inspiratory flow; an additional subset of tests was conducted in condition of purposely insufficient inflow (i.e.: high respiratory distress and 60 L/min inflow).Results:Explored tidal volumes ranged from 250 to 910 mL. The Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of −3.2 ± 29.3 mL for measured tidal volumes as compared to reference, corresponding to an average relative error of −1 ± 4.4% (see Fig. 1). At univariate analyses, tidal volume underestimation correlated with respiratory rate (rho = .411,p= .004) but not with peak inspiratory flow, distress, or PEEP.

A standard helmet inflow (60 L/min), a value lower than peak inspiratory flow in case of high respiratory distress (pMusc 20 and 25 cmH2O, empty circles), lead to underestimation of tidal volumes; the higher the peak inspiratory flow, the higher the underestimation error (r = − 0.905p< .001)P007Non-invasive ventilation in ≥ 70 year old COVID-19 patients in a level two unit: retrospective cohort analysis, comparison with COVIP substudy and defense of a multifaceted work of breathing control driven strategyJ Rua, P Costa, AR Nogueira, JM MateusCentro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Serviço de Medicina Intensiva, Coimbra, PortugalCritical Care2023,27(S1): P007Introduction:The debate about optimal management of patients with COVID-19 ARDS remains, including medical treatment, ventilatory strategies, awake proning and others. COVIP is a multicentric observational study with over 3000 patients under NIV. A substudy by Polok and al. evaluated patients (PTS) ≥ 70 years old. At our intermediate care unit (IU) we used a strategy of high dose corticosteroid started when the work of breathing (WOB) increased, prolonged awake prone positioning (> 12 h) and high CPAP ventilatory strategy. We describe our cohort of ≥ 70 years old NIV PTS and compare it to COVIP substudy results.Methods:Descriptive retrospective study. Data were collected from electronic medical records of 95 COVID-19 PTS aged 70 years old or above under NIV at the IU between September/20 and March/21. Categorical data are presented as frequency (percentage) and were compared using χ2-test. Continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Cohort results were compared with those from Polok et al. COVIP substudy (COVIPss).Results:95 of PTS were submitted to NIV. Median age was 76 years and 49.5% were male, versus 75.7 and 71.4% in COVIPss. Median admission SOFA score was 4 and CFS was 3 with 14% considered frail (CFS > 5). In COVIPss median SOFA was 5 and 17% of PTS were frail. The preferred mode was CPAP with median maximum pressure of 13. Mean PaO2/fiO2 ratio after start of NIV was 125, 30% < 100. NIV failure occurred in 46.3% versus 74,7% in COVIPss. Our intra-unit mortality was 31.6%. 14 PTS (14.7%) were submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation and 57% of those died.

Before the COVID pandemic, non-invasive ventilation was associated with higher mortality in ARDS, and early intubation was advocated. We hypothesized that HFNC treatment was more restrictive in the first wave of the COVID pandemic compared to the second wave respecting the pre-COVID conceptual consensus of early intubation in ARDS.Methods:We conducted this retrospective observational single-center study in a tertiary ICU in Brussels during the COVID pandemic. The first flare-up ranged from March to May 2020, and the second flare-up from September to January 2021. All patients with COVID pneumonia and HFNC before intubation were included. We considered a delayed intubation a ROXi < 3.85 at the start of HFNC. ROXi is the ratio of SpO2/FiO2to the respiratory rate. The primary outcome was delayed intubation based on the ROXi in the number of days. The secondary outcome was mortality.Results:We included 60 patients in the first wave and 70 in the second wave. The duration of HFNC treatment before intubation was longer during the second wave, based on ROXi < 3.85: 1.6 days versus 2.8 days,p< 0.05 (Fig. 1). There was no significant difference in mortality, 18% versus 29%. The length of intubation was similar in both groups. The CCI, SOFA, APACHE III and SAPS II scores were similar in both groups.Conclusions:The duration of HFNC treatment in COVID-19-related ARDS before intubation has significantly been extended in the second pandemic wave. The delayed intubation based on the ROXi was in this study without significantly increased mortality. However, a trend toward higher mortality after prolonged HFNC was seen in the second pandemic wave.Fig. 1 (abstract P008).

ICU mortality rate was 22% (21/94), total in-hospital mortality was 38% (36/94). HFNC was used as first line respiratory support in 58/94 cases, of which 39.6% required intubation. Of those patients who failed HFNC, time to intubation was significantly higher in those patients who passed away than those who were intubated and survived (mean 6.08 days vs 2.86 days,p< 0.05 one sided T-test). In all patients, very late intubation defined as intubation > 5d post admission to ICU, occurred in 6/41 patients, of which the mortality rate was 100%. ROX score performed at 12 h post intubation was unable to discriminate those who succeeded with HFNC and those who required intubation (mean ROX 7.24 vs 7.9,p> 0.05).

Outcomes included in-hospital mortality and 1-year modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Logistic regression was used to estimate the age and Charlson Comorbidity Index adjusted odds ratio (OR) of in-hospital death. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate differences in the mRs.Results:The cohort was predominantly non-Latino white (76%), male (65%), unvaccinated (99.4%), mean age of 66, and good pre-COVID-19 functional status (median mRs score of 0).

The diaphragmatic function can be evaluated with bedside ultrasound. The diaphragmatic excursion is one of the methods in diaphragmatic ultrasound for detecting diaphragm dysfunction [1–3]. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the diaphragmatic excursion to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Methods: In this prospective study, patients 18 years and older who visited the emergency department (ED) with critical illness were enrolled to measure the right-side diaphragmatic excursion within 10 min after arrival. Multivariable logistic regression and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to assess the performance of the diaphragmatic excursion to predict IMV.Results:314 patients were enrolled in this study, and 113 (35.9%) patients required IMV. The diaphragmatic excursion was an independent risk of receiving IMV with adjusted odd ratios 0.08 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04–0.17,pvalue < 0.001] and had the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.850 (95% CI 0.807–0.894). The cut-off of the diaphragmatic excursion was 1.2 cm with a sensitivity of 82.3% (95% CI 74.0–88.8%) and specificity of 78.1% (95% CI 71.7–83.6%) (Table 1). Ventilator days in the diaphragmatic excursion < 1.2 cm (cm) was significantly longer [13 days (interquartile range (IQR); 5.27) versus 5 (IQR; 3, 8),pvalue 0.006].Conclusions:The right-side diaphragmatic excursion had a good performance in predicting IMV in critical illness.

Determination of tEby the quotient between exhaled tidal volume (Vt) and flow rate values between 0.10 and 0.5 s, during passive lung emptying, are linear fit. However, in EMA, tEobtained from exhaled Vt at 66% is dissociated from tEdetermined by 25–75% of the expiratory flow-volume curves (tE25–75%). EMA increases the pleural pressure, with partial airway pressure (Paw) collapse and expiratory flow limiting. Our purpose was to evaluate the index tE25–75%/tE66%, to identify EMA.Methods:A retrospective study, made by Córdoba University Hospital (January-May 2020), using available recordings of flow, Paw, esophageal (Pes) and gastric pressure (Pgas) of consecutive patients admitted to ICU, during partially assisted mechanical ventilation.

Diaphragmatic ultrasound (DUS) is the preferred method for the evaluation of diaphragm function in the ICU setting, namely through the diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF). However, its potential role in the decision-making process of mechanical ventilation weaning is yet to be established. We aimed to assess the incidence of early DD and its role as a predictor of prolonged IMV.Methods:We conducted a prospective, non-interventional study in a universitary hospital ICU. Adult patients subject to at least 48 h of IMV were consecutively enrolled. Exclusion criteria was a prior period of IMV in the past 3 months. DUS was performed at 48 h of IMV. End-inspiratory and end-expiratory diaphragm thickness were measured using M-mode, with a high-frequency linear probe placed at the zone of apposition of the diaphragm. The mean values of 3 measurements were used to calculate DTF. Interobserver measurement variability was not evaluated.Results:32 patients were included. 34.4% were female, average age was 59.9 years. Mean SAPS II and SOFA at admission were 52.87 and 7.84, respectively. Mean DTF was 21.10% (± 14.59). Average IMV duration was 10.13 days (± 8.43). 75% of patients had DD at 48 h of IMV. A weak negative correlation (r < − 0.1) was observed between DTF, days of endotracheal intubation (p value 0.609) and days of IMV (p value 0.756). Using DTF cut-off values of 20% and 30%, DTF at 48 h of IMV did not correlate with prolonged IMV (p value of 0.427 and 0.704, respectively).Conclusions:In our preliminary data, there was a high prevalence of DD at 48 h of IMV, as suggested in previous literature. DD at 48 h when measured through DTF did not seem to predict prolonged IMV. DUS is well-established for diaphragm functional assessment, but further research is needed to clarify its application in clinical practice.P015The effect of differing loading conditions on ultrasound assessment of diaphragm functionIS Morris, EC GoligherUniversity Health Network, Department of Adult Critical Care Medicine, Toronto, CanadaCritical Care2023,27(S1): P015Introduction:Diaphragm dysfunction is a common cause of failure to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation [1]."

The influence of varying physiological conditions on these measurements has not been systematically evaluated.Methods:Healthy adult volunteers underwent esophageal and gastric balloon placement to measure transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). Diaphragm thickening fraction (TFdi) and diaphragm excursion (EXdi) were measured under varying resistive load (none, marked, complete airway occlusion), varying postural load (semi-recumbent vs. supine) and varying thoracoabdominal motion (abdominal- vs. rib cage-predominant inspiration). The influence of physiological conditions on these measurements was analyzed by linear mixed effect regression.Results:Nine participants were included. Pdi swing increased with resistive load (p< 0.001) and decreased in the supine position (p< 0.001) (Table 1). By contrast, TFdi did not change significantly when marked resistance was applied (p= 0.44) but decreased with complete airway resistance (p= 0.055). TFdi also decreased in the supine position (p= 0.004) and with rib cage-predominant inspiration (p< 0.001). EXdi decreased with increasing resistance (p< 0.001) and supine position (p= 0.013).Conclusions:Changing physiological conditions has differential effects on Pdi, TFdi, and EXdi. Position, mechanical load, and thoracoabdominal motion should be considered when interpreting these parameters to assess diaphragm function.

We report our experience utilizing a temporary DP system during cardiac procedures.Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of prospective IRB approved databases of non-randomized interventional experiences at a single institution. Subgroup analysis was then limited to patients implanted with the temporary DP system (TransAeris, Synapse Biomedical) during cardiac procedures. Prior to sternotomy closure, the pleural space is opened, two electrodes are placed in each hemi- diaphragm. The electrodes also record diaphragm burst electromyography (dEMG). Once in the intensive care unit DP ensued using a disposable multi-channel stimulator generating a fused diaphragm contraction preventing VIDD.Results:From 1/1/2020 to 6/30/22 252 patients were implanted with either the chronic long term DP (NeuRx) or the temporary DP system. 21 patients were implanted with the temporary DP system during a cardiac procedure. All had risk factors that predict prolonged MV including: prior open cardiac surgery, LVEF less than 30%, COPD, history of CVA, or pre-operative intra-aortic balloon pump In 3 patients, there was rapid weaning with bilateral dEMG and no stimulation occurred. The remaining 18 patients underwent diaphragm stimulation to facilitate weaning and maintain diaphragm strength. In patients with pre-existing unilateral dysfunction, DP prevented paradoxical diaphragm movement and associated sleep dysfunction. There were no adverse events related to electrode implantation, stimulation or subsequent removal.Conclusions:Prolonged MV after cardiac surgery leads to significant morbidity, mortality and cost. DP was safely used to wean from MV, prevent VIDD and the electrodes can identify and improve recovery of phrenic nerve injuries.P017Comparison of ultrasound assessment for diaphragmatic workload during spontaneous breathing trial between tube compensation and pressure support ventilationN Kulkanokwan1, S Morakul2, C Pisitsak2, W Mongkolpun3, P Theerawit11Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Division Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand,2Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Department of Anesthesiology, Bangkok, Thailand,3Siriraj Piyamaharajkarun Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Bangkok, ThailandCritical Care2023,27(S1):P017Introduction:Spontaneous breathing trail (SBT) with pressure support ventilation (PSV) might provide over assistant while SBT with T-pieces may increase workload.

TC (30 min) was performed and PSV 5 cmH2O (30 min) was done after TC in one group. In the other group, PSV was performed before TC. During the washout period, baseline ventilation was resumed until tidal volume, respiratory rate, and heart rate were return to baseline. Before and immediate after 30 min of PSV and TC, diaphragmatic workload parameters were assessed by relative change (%) of diaphragm thickness fraction (∆DTF), diaphragm excursion (∆DE) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) parameters of peak contraction velocity (∆PCV), peak relaxation velocity (∆PRV), velocity–time integral (∆VTI) and TDI-derived maximal relaxation rate (∆TDI-MRR).Results:For our results, the interaction between period and treatment was significant. So, we used only the first period in our interpretation. Among 48 patients who met the inclusion criteria, nobody failed SBT before 30 min. ∆DTF was significant greater with TC than with PSV ([65.84 (17.52, 83.38)] % vs [0.49 (−40.85, 30.47)] %,p< 0.01, respectively). ∆DE was significant greater with TC [14.75(0.00,36.45)] than with PSV [−9.47(−33.14, −1.01)] % (p< 0.01).

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between PIH and metabolic acidosis, adjusted with known risk factors (shock index (SI) before intubation, age, gender, use of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, and intubation for respiratory failure).Results:In total, 257 patients were enrolled in the current study, and 87 patients (33.9%) developed PIH.

Leakage around the ETT cuff is known to contribute to microaspiration [2]. A tapered shaped ETT cuff, in the adult population, has demonstrated less fluid leakage [3] and possibly a decrease in tracheal damage [1]. A taper shaped ETT cuff, intended for the pediatric population, was recently introduced. The object of this study was to compare fluid sealing performance of a taper shaped ETT cuff (Falcon II, Medtronic, Boulder, CO, USA) to that of barrel shaped ETT cuffs (Shiley™ Hi-Lo, Medtronic, Boulder CO USA; MicroCuff, Avanos) using excised animal tracheas.Methods:Excised rabbit tracheas, including larynx, were utilized. Tracheas were wrapped in saline soaked gauze to prevent drying and suspended by a laboratory clamp stand. Prior to intubation, the cuffs were inflated to 50 cmH2O to eliminate any wrinkles and confirm integrity. After placement in the trachea, the cuffs were inflated to 25 cmH2O and monitored continuously. Saline (0.5–1.0 ml) was placed on top of the ETT cuff and leak volume was collected at 1, 5 and 10 min using a beaker placed on a digital scale.

The aim of this study was to assess the ventilator parameters for the patients with traumatic brain injury under adaptive support ventilation (ASV).Methods:This prospective observational study was conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Republican Vilnius University Hospital. We included 11 patients ventilated at least 48 h with ventilators Hamilton S1 using INTELLiVENT®-ASV mode applying automatic control of minute volume, positive end expiratory pressure, and FiO2. IntelliSync + tool was applied for better synchronization between the inspiratory and expiratory times of patient respiratory system and ventilator. The patients were continuously monitored using Acrux DeepBreath software. The study protocol was approved by the regional Vilnius bioethics committee (2021/9-1380-851).Results:A total duration of mechanical ventilation for all patients was 1541 h (from 62 to 289). A total of 1,847,197 breath cycles were analysed after exclusion of 2.3% of cycles defined as artefacts related to nursing, and therapeutic interventions. 95.2% of all breath cycles (for single patient: min. 86.8–max. 98.8%) meet criteria for lung protection (Pmax ≤ 30cmH2O, VT/IBW ≤ 12 ml/kg).

Ventilator associated lung injury can be reduced by a more homogenous ventilation. Two parameters concerning ventilation homogeneity can be conducted by using electric impedance tomography (EIT). Regional ventilation delay (RVD) displays regional varying time constants [1]. Intratidal variation (ITV) describes impedance changes [2].Methods:In this observational prospective study, included patients were intubated and sedated because of a respiratory disease, and had no signs of spontaneous breathing. EIT measurements were performed during PCV first, followed by VCV during five minutes each. Respiratory frequency, inspiratory time and PEEP were held constant. In RVD, five regions of interests were investigated (global, ventral, midventral, middorsal and dorsal). In ITV, there were four regions (ventral, midventral, middorsal and dorsal). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used.Results:Five patients were included. ITV measurements did not show any statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between PCV and VCV. RVD measurements showed a trend to a higher RVD in the middorsal part in every patient when VCV was applied [median(IQR) + 0.95% (+ 0.84; + 1.04),p= 0.0625]. Other results were neither statistically significant, nor clinically relevant.Conclusions:There was no evidence for relevant differences in ventilation homogeneity between PCV and VCV, as measured by ITV. For RVD there was a trend that only the middorsal part, against expectations, experiences a less homogenous ventilation during VCV, with no relevant differences in other regions.

In this study, we compared values obtained every minute from the ventilator to clarify the relationship between ventilatory management and the risk of developing ALS.Methods:This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study for a 21-months period. Patient background, ventilator data, and outcomes were collected from adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia on ventilator-assisted respiratory management. The primary outcome was the development of ALS within 30 days of starting ventilator management.Results:Of the 105 patients, 14 (13%) developed ALS. The mean positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) difference was 0.33 cmH2O (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31–0.33), and it was higher in the ALS than in the non-ALS group (9.18 ± 2.20 versus 8.85 ± 2.63, respectively). For peak pressure, the mean difference was −0.18 cmH2O (95% CI −0.20 to −0.15), (20.70 ± 5.30 vs. 20.87 ± 5.65) and the mean pressure difference of −0.05 cmH2O (95% CI −0.04 to −0.07) (12.80 ± 3.13 vs. 12.85 ± 3.55, respectively) was also higher in the non-ALS group. The difference in the single ventilation volume per ideal body weight was 0.65 ml/kg (95% CI 0.63–0.66) (7.83 ± 3.16 vs. 7.18 ± 2.96, respectively), and the difference in dynamic lung compliance was 8.57 mL/cmH2O (95% CI 8.43–8.70) (50.32 ± 31.68 vs. 49.68 ± 15.16, respectively), and both were higher in the ALS group. The percentage of times that the ventilation volume per body weight exceeded 8 was higher in the ALS group (53.7% vs. 38.6%,p< 0.001).Conclusions:There was no association between higher ventilator pressures and the development of ALS. The ALS group had higher dynamic lung compliance and higher tidal volumes, which may indicate a pulmonary contribution to ALS, and ventilatory management that limits tidal volume may prevent the development of ALS.P027VentConnect: telemetry system that enables remote live transmission of ventilator screen: qualitative study of clinicians’ expectations and experienceV Zvonicek1, M Macik2, J Jirman2, M Nemy2, L Vyslouzilova2, F Duska31University Hospital Kralovské Vinohrady, ICU, Prague, Czech Republic,2Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic,3University Hospital Kralovské Vinohrady, Prague, Czech RepublicCritical Care2023,27(S1): P027Introduction:To maximise the input of intensivists onto the management of ventilated patients during the COVID pandemic, we have developed and implemented telemetry system VentConnect [1].

By far the most demanded was the ability to see flow curve or flow pattern (100%), followed by inspiratory pressures (75%) and check tidal volume (63%). Other parameters were mentioned less frequently such as driving pressure (25%) and interferences (38%). With regards users experience, answers were overwhelmingly positive, highlighting mostly the ability to continuously monitor the progress of patients without the need to donning personal protective equipment. In some, however, curiosity was the only motivator for use. Three juniors expressed apprehension that their supervisors might criticise their ventilator setting which would otherwise had gone unnoticed. Two participants thought that the temptation to check patient 24/7 would impair their ability to rest and relax during their off time.Conclusions:Telemetry system that enabled clinicians to remotely check ventilator screen met the expectation of clinicians, who mainly demanded to check flow patterns, tidal volumes and pressures.

Specialist weaning units offer dedicated multi-professional care to patients within a cohorted environment while freeing acute critical care capacity. Elsewhere in the UK, the impact of weaning unit on critical care capacity has been modelled using a transfer threshold of 21 days [2], whereas for Wales the benefit of centralising patients ventilated > 100 days has been evaluated [4].Methods:The aim of this study was to evaluate over a 5-years period: numbers of patients requiring prolonged ventilation regionally, their underlying characteristics, critical care utilisation, outcome and discharge disposition. We conducted a retrospective analysis, utilising the critical care database of three North Wales ICUs from April 1st 2017 to 31st March 2022.Results:During the study period, 3640 critically ill patients received invasive respiratory support over 22,245 ventilator days.

Two patients were transferred to an external weaning unit for specialist management after median 203 days.Conclusions:Patients requiring a mechanical ventilation for ≥ 30 days account for a significant proportion of ventilator days. The majority of such patients have a respiratory primary diagnosis and survive to hospital discharge; their needs may be sufficiently homogenous and the impact on wider critical care capacity sufficiently great that cohorting within an appropriately resourced specialist weaning unit may be appropriate.

We compared accuracy, consumption and NO2 formation in simulated ventilation conditions.Methods:Four iNO devices were evaluated on a Michigan test lung (acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome model), connected to two ventilators (V800, Dräger and R860, GE Healthcare), seated at three different bias flows.

Low intensity of ventilation during surgery and in the ICU has been associated with improved patient outcomes [1, 2]. However, there is a lack of information on the effect of ventilation adjustments when transitioning surgical patients to the ICU. We hypothesized that changes in MP from the operating room (OR) to the ICU are associated with 28-day mortality.Methods:1970 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia between 2008 and 2022, receiving continued, controlled mechanical ventilation in the ICU, were included in this retrospective study. Median MP was calculated for the last intraoperative hour and first six hours of ICU ventilation [3]. The association of MP changes from OR to ICU and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative factors. Relative importance of changes in individual parameters was determined by dominance analysis.Results:199 patients (10.1%) died within 28 days of surgery. Median (IQR) MP in the OR was 9.1 (6.7–11.7) and 9.7 (7.9–12.0) J/min in the ICU. Upon transition to ICU ventilation, Vt and DP were decreased, while RR was increased, and overall MP remained constant (Fig. 1A). An increase in MP from OR to ICU was associated with higher mortality (aOR 1.10 per 1 J/min increase, [1.05–1.14],p< 0.001, Fig. 1B).

Prophylactic minitracheostomy (PMT), a technique to assist in removing airway secretions while maintaining the glottic function, allows repeated airway suctioning and can reduce incidents of intubation. However, The clinical value of PMT in acute CSCI patients is unclear. In our tertiary emergency center, PMT is performed on patients at high risk of sputum retention to prevent unexpected RE and intubation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of PMT in acute CSCI patients.Methods:We performed a retrospective review of patients with acute traumatic CSCI admitted to our hospital from April 2011 to April 2021. A total of 44 patients undergoing PMT were enrolled. The medical record was reviewed for age, ISS (Injury Severity Score), probability of survival (Ps), level of spinal cord injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), intubation because of RE, the success of decannulation, in-hospital mortality, complications related to the procedure.Results:The median age was 67 years [interquartile range (IQR): 49–76]. The median ISS and Ps were 25 [IQR: 20–30], 0.86 [IQR: 0.69–0.94]. 33 patients out of 44 (75%) were classified as AIS grade A. 8 out of 44 (18.2%), all classified as AIS grade A, required emergency intubation at RE. That means PMT was ineffective in about one-fourth of severe CSCI patients (AIS grade A). One patient (2.3%) died in-hospital regardless of respiratory problems. One patient was intubated on the next day of PMT because of a tracheal hemorrhage.

Data from the pre-pandemic era has demonstrated the use of tracheostomy for ventilator weaning [1]. However, the use of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients was a subject of discussion [2]. Nevertheless, evidence of the impact of tracheostomy on the outcome in critically ill COVID patients is still lacking. This study aims to evaluate the impact on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) outcome (survival) of tracheostomy in COVID-19 ventilated patients.Methods:Monocentric descriptive observational study. Demographic and clinical data, timing of tracheostomy and outcome (ICU mortality) from 1st January to 31st December 2021 were registered. Analysis of descriptive statistics for continuous variables and survival analysis (log rank test).Results:115 patients were included (72% males), all mechanically ventilated, 7 (6%) were subjected to tracheostomy. The mean age was 67.2 years (range 36–84 years). The ICU mortality was 62% (71). The group of patients not submitted to tracheostomy had a mean survival time of 24.4 days (SD ± 1.5) and median survival time of 22 days (SD ± 1.7). The group of patients that were subjected to tracheostomy, the mean survival time was 68.5 days (SD ± 12.2) and median survival time was 50 days (SD ± 2). This comparison is significative (Log Rank test,p= 0.0001).Conclusions:The present study demonstrates a better survival likelihood of the tracheostomized subpopulation.

Previous reports have described ICU stays and weaning as prolonged in patients who developed COVID‐19 ARDS. Prolonged MV is the most common indication for tracheostomy in ICU patients. Pre-pandemic evidence on the benefits of early tracheostomy is conflicting but suggests shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates compared to late tracheostomy.Methods:We followed the standard Cochrane methodology to conduct the systematic review and meta-analyses. RCTs and observational studies evaluating concepts of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy in critically-ill COVID-19 patients were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and ROBINS I tool. The quality of evidence in our prioritized categories was assessed using GRADE.Results:We included 1 RCT with 150 participants and 24 observational studies with 6372 critically-ill COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1). RoB assessment for the RCT was considered to be low. RoB for the observational studies was considered to be critical.Conclusions:We found low-certainty evidence that early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality in critically-ill COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). In terms of clinical improvement, early tracheostomy results in little to no difference in duration to liberation from MV. We are not certain about the impact on clinical worsening and ICU length of stay (LOS).Our sensitivity analysis suggests that early tracheostomy may reduce the duration of invasive MV and the ICU LOS.The overall evidence in this review is graded as low and can only be interpreted as a indication that early compared to late tracheostomy may be recommended to shorten the duration of MV in critically-ill COVID-19 patients and to reduce all-cause mortality.Fig. 1 (abstract P034).

Hospital length of stay for patients without tracheostomy was 19 days (range 19–27) and those requiring tracheostomies was 31 days (21–42).Conclusions:Early DP allowed up to 57% of previously non-weanable patients to be extubated without tracheostomies.P036Early versus late tracheostomy in multiple trauma patients in the intensive care unit: systematic review and meta-analysisK Ansems, E Aleksandrova, AS Szafran, K Dahms, T Breuer, C BenstoemMedical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Department of Intensive Care Medicine and Intermediate Care, Aachen, GermanyCritical Care2023,27(S1): P036Introduction:The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effects and safety of concepts of early tracheostomy (ET) compared to concepts of late tracheostomy (LT) in patients with multiple trauma on the ICU.Methods:We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing ET with LT in adult patients with polytrauma in the ICU were included, regardless of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-I tool. The quality of evidence, in the categories we prioritized, was assessed using GRADE.Results:We included one RCT (n = 60) and nine observational studies with a total of 1.694 multiple trauma patients who underwent tracheostomy. Statistical analysis of the RCT data showed that ET (≤ 8 days) was likely to have little or no effect on all-cause mortality. We found no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, or number of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Data from observational studies showed that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ET (≤ 7 days) on ICU mortality.

And improves outcomes for critically patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Initially avoided due to it’s high risk to biosafety, tracheostomy soon became a routine procedure in the critical support of critical ill patients affected by COVID-19. The aim of this review was to compare tracheostomy done in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonias in an UCI.Methods:This retrospective, observational study included 78 patients (23 female, 55 male; age range: 23–90 years, mean age: 66) with severe pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Hospital Beatriz Ângelo (Portugal) between 01/03/2012 until 31/12/2021, to whom a tracheostomy was performed. Patients underwent orotracheal intubation with invasive mechanical ventilation, followed by percutaneous or open surgical tracheotomy. Indications, timing of the procedure, and time needed to complete weaning and decannulation, as well as complications, were reported and compared between patients with COVID-19 (N = 38) and non-COVID-19 (N = 40) pneumonias.Results:In both groups, weaning from difficult ventilation was the most common indication for the procedure, followed by prolonged mechanical ventilation in the COVID-19 group (42%) and protection of the airway/secretions management in the non-COVID-19 group (22.5%). Timing of the procedure was 14.6 and 16.4 days after mechanical ventilation in the COVID-19 and non-COVID group, respectively. The non-COVID-19 group reported more days to decannulation (39.3 vs 15.1 days) as well as more days to wean off from mechanical ventilation (20.3 vs 14.1 days) and more major complications (12.5% vs 2%).

We assessed brain atrophy in mechanically ventilated patients using brain CT scans, and their findings’ relationship to outcomes.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed mechanically ventilated patients admitted to an ICU who underwent at least two head CT scans during hospitalization. Patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or hypoxic encephalopathy were excluded. The first brain CT scan was routinely performed on admission, and the second and further brain CT scans were obtained whenever prolonged disturbance of consciousness was observed. Brain volume was estimated using an automatic segmentation method, and patients with a brain volume change < 0% from the first CT scan to the second CT scan were defined as the “brain atrophy group” and those with ≥ 0% were defined as the “no brain atrophy group.” Duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and mortality were compared between the groups.Results:A total of 52 patients were included, 44 in the brain atrophy group and 8 in the no brain atrophy group. Analysis of the brain atrophy group showed a significant decrease in brain volume (first CT scan: 1.042 ± 0.124 L vs. second CT scan: 0.998 ± 0.123 L, t (43) = 9.705,p< 0.001). The mean change in brain volume in the brain atrophy group was − 43.5 cm3over a median of 33 days. The median time on mechanical ventilation was 33 (IQR: 18–60) days and 25 (19–43) days, length of ICU stay was 30 (16–61) days and 30 (17–56) days, and mortality rate was 31.8% (14/44 cases) and 50.0% (4/8 cases) in the brain atrophy group and the no brain atrophy group, respectively.Conclusions:Many ICU patients on mechanical ventilation who developed prolonged mental status changes showed signs of brain atrophy. Patients with rapidly progressive brain atrophy were more likely to have a longer duration of mechanical ventilation.P039A quality improvement project to analyse the impact of an"

An initial audit of our mixed adult ICU demonstrated a failed extubation rate of 23.3%, far higher than the recommended rate of 5–10% [1]. Our aim was to determine whether an extubation checklist would reduce reintubations and improve flow through the ICU.Methods:All extubations at Chelsea and Westminster ICU during two 3-month periods, pre and post-intervention, were analysed. Patients who underwent primary tracheostomy, self-extubation, transfer to a different facility or extubation as part of end-of-life care were excluded. Our intervention consisted of a checklist, to be completed prior to extubation, which was based on current literature and case analyses of failed extubations in the first 3-month period. The primary outcome was rates of failed extubation and the secondary outcome was extubation time. Compliance with the intervention was determined by measuring rates of completed checklists and doctors were surveyed to assess reasons for non-compliance.Results:Pre-checklist (Oct–Jan 2022) there were 30 primary extubations, of which 7 failed. Post-intervention (Feb–May 2022) there were 28 primary extubations, of which 2 failed. This showed that rates of failed extubation reduced by 16.2% following checklist introduction (Fig. 1) and on average, patients were extubated 1 h and 45 min earlier in the day. Compliance with the intervention was 39%. Our survey results showed that 55% of non-compliance was due to administration issues.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that an extubation checklist is a simple and effective tool to reduce rates of failed extubation. Although compliance was low, our survey indicated that this was largely due to administrative issues which could be easily addressed.

After comparing with a pre-existing extubation standard operating procedure (SOP), this checklist was expanded on and approved for implementation. We will evaluate the use of this checklist by auditing documentation of its use, staff feedback and further assessment of reintubation rates (Phase 2).Results:Data collected showed that six of the 20 patients (30%) studied were reintubated within 48 h of their initial extubation. Reasons for reintubation included stridor, epistaxis, drowsiness, and failed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) trial. The preliminary checklist created defined a list of airway risk factors and included steps from identifying readiness for extubation until post-extubation care. The SOP incorporated standard extubation criteria for use in all patients, and an extended criteria for complex patients as well as clearly defined targets for each parameter. The final checklist contains elements from both, and patients intubated for more than 10 days qualify for the extended criteria (Fig. 1).Conclusions:This project highlights the importance of contributions from the multidisciplinary team to ensure the successful uptake and implementation of an intervention.ReferencesThille AW et al.

Five-fold cross validation was performed on each model to compare the accuracy of models with and without uncertainty output. Outcome was extubation failure, which was defined as reiintubation within 72 h after extubation.Results:In MIMIC-III, 1203 patients underwent extubation, 1075 successfully and 128 unsuccessfully.

NR2A is anN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor linked to cellular survival and death. A greater concentration of synaptic NR2A is associated with cell survival and improved working memory. Temporary transvenous diaphragm neurostimulation (TTDN) in association with MV has been shown to mitigate hippocampal apoptosis in preclinical models. This study focused on investigating whether 12 h of MV with moderate ARDS would lead to a change in NR2A tissue concentration in the brainstem and whether diaphragm neurostimulation would affect that.Methods:Juvenile pigs (4–5 months, 50–87 kg) underwent protective MV (volume control, PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume 8 ml/kg) for 12 h, after being induced with moderate ARDS by injecting oleic acid into the pulmonary artery until PaO2/FiO2was between 100 and 200. Subjects were assigned to three groups (n = 6 per group): lung injury with MV only (MV), lung injury with MV and with TTDN every other breath (MV + TTDN50%), and lung injury with MV and with TTDN every breath (MV + TTDN100%). Diaphragm neurostimulation was delivered using methods published previously. After the study, the brainstem (pons and medulla oblongata) was harvested and marked with enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure the tissue concentration of NR2A. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for statistical analyses.pvalues < 0.05 are considered statistically significant.Results:Brainstem NR2A concentrations were 4 pg/ml (3–5) for the MV group, 5 pg/ml (5–8) for the MV + TTDN50% group, and 7 pg/ml (6–8) for the MV + TTDN100% group, with a significant difference between the MV and the MV + TTDN100% groups,p= 0.0125 (Fig. 1).Conclusions:In a preclinical model of moderate ARDS, diaphragm neurostimulation on every breath in association with MV for 12 h led to significantly greater concentrations of NR2A in the brainstem, compared to the group receiving MV, only, for 12 h.Fig. 1 (abstract P043)Brainstem NR2A concentrationsP044Heart rate fluctuations and mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure: a retrospective analysis of the"

Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to investigate if changes in heart rates are connected with 28-day mortality among patients with acute respiratory failure after controlling for other factors.Methods:A total of patients 6719 with acute respiratory failure was recruited into the Medical Information Mart database for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III in this investigation, which was conducted as a cohort study. Within 24 h of admission, variations in heart rate were estimated as the difference between maximum heart rate and minimum heart rate. Individuals were divided into three groups: those with low heart rate fluctuations [less than thirty beats per minute], those with central rate fluctuations (30–49 beats per minute), and those with high heart rate fluctuations (more than fifty beats per minute). We used models of multivariate logistics regression, Generalized additive models and linear regression models of two segments to examine the influence of 24-h heart rate variations on death on the 28 day.Results:Sixty-seven hundred and ninety patients suffering from acute respiratory failure were included in the study. The fluctuations in heart rates were independent due to 28-day mortality (dominance ratio [OR] 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI (1.4–1.89);p< 0.001) adjusted for possible confusion. There was a non-linear association between heart rate fluctuations and 28-day mortality with a threshold of approximately 21 beats per minute. The effects sizes and ci were 0.98 (0.96, 1.00) and 1.01 (1.00, 1.01) respectively.Conclusions:In patients suffering from acute respiratory failure, there is a non-linear association between heart rate fluctuations over 24 h and 28-day mortality, with a particularly marked increase in death on the 28th day when heart rate fluctuations exceed 21 beats per minute.P045WITHDRAWNP046Mechanical power in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the surgical intensive care unit and the association with increased mortalityA Piriyapatsom, A Trisukhonth, O ChintabanyatDepartment of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Anesthesiology, Bangkok, ThailandCritical Care2023,27(S1): P046Introduction:Mechanical power (MP) represents the amount of energy delivered by mechanical ventilation (MV) to overcome elastic static, elastic dynamic and resistive components"

The Cox regression analyses demonstrated that MP ≥ 10 J/min at the initiation of MV and MP ≥ 10 J/min both at the initiation and at 24 h of MV were associated with increased 90-day mortality (HR 1.855, 95% CI 1.074–3.203 and HR 1.906, 95% CI 1.080–3.361, respectively). In subgroup of patients with MP ≥ 10 J/min at the initiation of MV support, further increasing in MP at 24 h of MV was associated with increased 90-day mortality (HR per J/min 1.093, 95% CI 1.007–1.187).Conclusions:In mechanically ventilated patients in the SICU, the MP was an independent factor associated with 90-day mortality.

Although there are no strict recommendations on the use of PEEP during catheterization, there is a common clinical practice of reducing PEEP to 0 cm H2O in order to prevent a pleural puncture. We investigated the effect of applying PEEP on the distances from SCV to pleura (DSCV-Pleura) as well as the effect of PEEP on the cross-sectional area of the SCV (CSASCV). We hypothesize that administration of PEEP will not affect the DSCV-Pleurathereby not increasing the risk of pneumothorax. In addition, applying PEEP may facilitate SCV catheterization by increasing the CSASCV.Methods:We included 20 adult patients admitted at the ICU of ZNA Antwerp in 2022 following cardiac surgery who were mechanically ventilated. Using ultrasound we measured the cross-sectional diameter of the SCV (CSDSCV) and DSCV-Pleuraafter administration of PEEP 0 till 15 cm H2O. Differences of CSDSCVand DSCV-Pleuraafter applying PEEP were assessed with repeated measures ANOVA and paired sample t-test.Results:There was no significant difference of DSCV-Pleurabetween PEEP 0 and PEEP 15 (p= 0.336). Measurements of CSDSCVshowed no significant difference of CSASCVbetween PEEP 0 and PEEP 15 (p= 0.085) (Table 1).Conclusions:The administration of PEEP did not affect the DSCV-Pleuraneither the CSASCV, thereby questioning the common clinical practice of reducing PEEP to 0 cm H2O during SCV catheterization. Our findings suggest we could maintain a level of PEEP during SCV catheterization in mechanically ventilated patients with the aim of preventing alveolar derecruitment and desaturation [2]. Moreover, there was no proof of facilitation of catheterization by applying PEEP. Further research could help us to confirm these findings and improve medical practice.Table 1 (abstract P049)CSDSCV and DSCV-pleura after applying PEEPDSCV-Pleura(mm)CSDSCV(mm)PEEP 07.70 ± 3.03 (6.73–8.70)10.26 ± 2.14 (9.58–10.95)PEEP 157.38 ± 2.38 (6.62–8.14)*9.90 ± 2.43 (9.12–10.68)**Data of DSCV-pleuraand CSDSCVare shown as mean ± SD (95% confidence interval).

The results indicated that the normalized BALF lactate level in ARDS patients was significantly higher compared with non-ARDS patients (mmol/l, 20.6[13.8, 34.3] vs. 11.04[5.2, 21.4],p= 0.048), IL-1beta (ng/ml, 3277[653.5, 13865] vs. 537.7[337.9, 780.6],p= 0.027), IL-6 (ng/ml, 1798[689, 4136] vs. 65[48, 203],p< 0.001), IL-10 (mmol/l, 33.8[24.3, 68.2] vs. 14.6[7.3, 19.1],p< 0.001). BALF lactate was also associated with mortality in ARDS patients (HR 4.8, 95% CI 0.9–23.7, log-rankp= 0.0167), by a cut-off value of adjusted BALF lactate.Conclusions:BALF lactate was elevated in ARDS patients, and was associated with inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial adherence molecules.

Proteomic analysis of SAPs and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that LPS-SAPs contain several differentially expressed proteins involved in effecting an inflammatory response. In addition, we conducted transcriptome sequencing of lung fibroblasts treated with SAPs to explore the effect of SAPs on fibroblasts in ARDS, which demonstrated that the expression of several chemokines (chemokine ligand (CXCL)2, CXCL15, and so forth) significantly increased after SAP stimulation. Furthermore, the transwell assay indicated that SAPs could enhance the chemotactic activity of fibroblasts, suggesting that SAPs may exacerbate inflammation in ARDS by promoting neutrophil or monocyte recruitment.Conclusions:This is the first study to show that AM-derived SAPs contribute significantly to ARDS through promoting inflammatory cell recruitment by activating fibroblasts, which may be beneficial for therapeutic development of ARDS.P053Comparison of effect of chest percussion and expiratory rib cage compression on blood gases and static lung compliance in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a randomised crossover studyA Srivastava1, R Kumar1, M Gurjar1, B Poddar1, A Azim1, S Gutte1, P Mishra2, V Kapoor21Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Critical Care Medicine, Lucknow, India,2Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Biostatistics, Lucknow, IndiaCritical Care2023,27(S1): P053Introduction:This study compared the effect of two techniques of chest physiotherapy, chest percussion (CP) and expiratory rib cage compression (ERCC), on blood gases (PaO2and PaCO2), static lung compliance (Cstat) and secretion yield in mechanical ventilated patients with moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Methods:After institutional ethics committee approval, all adult ICU patients with moderate-severe ARDS on invasive ventilation were screened for this randomized crossover study (CTRI/2022/01/039650).

We, therefore, aimed to perform a secondary analysis of seven high-quality therapeutic randomized controlled trials.Methods:A secondary analysis of participants enrolled in 7 trials of ARDS and PETAL Networks [1–7].Results:We analyzed 5316 patients with ARDS, including 256 with postoperative ARDS. We found that prevalence of postoperative ARDS gradually declined between 2000 and 2011, and it was stabilized afterwards (R2= 0.821). Patients with postoperative ARDS, were older (p< 0.001), had more frequently sepsis (p< 0.001) and multiple transfusions (p< 0.001) as ARDS risk factors and presented lower 90-day mortality when compared to patients with ARDS not related to surgery [24.6% versus 30.9%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.51–0.85,p= 0.001]. In adjusted analysis, older age (p< 0.001), immunosuppression (p= 0.009), and increased cumulative fluid balance during the first 3 days (p< 0.001) were factors associated with 90-day mortality of patients with postoperative ARDS.Conclusions:Our findings put the epidemiology and clinical features of postoperative ARDS in perspective, and therefore, fill a missing gap in the literature. We also reveal that increased fluid balance (a potentially modifiable, practice-dependent factor) is associated with higher 90-day mortality in postoperative ARDS. Therefore, patients with postoperative ARDS may benefit from a conservative fluid management strategy.ReferencesBrower RG et al. N Engl J Med. 2000;342:1301–8.Brower RG et al.

Objective was to compare pulmonary and systemic biotrauma evaluated by numerous biomarkers of inflammation, epithelial, endothelial injuries, and lung repair according to two ventilator strategies on vv-ECMO.Methods:Prospective randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive during 48 h either ultra-lung-protective ventilation combining very low tidal volume (1–2 ml/kg of predicted body weight), low respiratory rate (5–10 cycles per minute), positive expiratory transpulmonary pressure, and 16 h of prone position or lung-protective-ventilation which followed the ECMO arm of the EOLIA trial (control group) (Fig. 1).Results:The primary outcome was the alveolar concentrations of interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, surfactant protein D, and blood concentrations of serum advanced glycation end products and angiopoietin-2 48 h after randomization. Enrollment was stopped for futility after the inclusion of 39 patients. Tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, plateau pressure, and mechanical power were significantly lower in the ultra-lung-protective group. None of the concentrations of the pre-specified biomarkers differed between the two groups 48 h after randomization. However, a trend to higher 60-day mortality was observed in the ultra-lung-protective group compared to the control group (45 vs 17%,p= 0.06).Conclusions:Despite a significant reduction of the mechanical power, ultra-lung-protective ventilation during 48 h did not reduce biotrauma in patients with vv-ECMO-supported"

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) originate from decondensed chromatin released to immobilize pathogens, and they can trigger contribute to sustained inflammation. However, their role in NET formation remains unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication between cells in physiological and pathological conditions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that EVs released during severe bacterial pneumonia were inflammatory and induced acute lung injury. Moreover, Endothelial cell (EC)-derived EVs increased markedly. Study has shown that EVs sustain NET formation. However, whether EC-derived EVs play a role in NET formation in ARDS has yet to be addressed.Methods:Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cocultured with EVs isolated from the supernatant of pulmonary microvascular ECs stimulated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was used to mimic septic ARDS in vivo; then, NET formation and molecular pathways were detected by transcriptome of EVs-Treated PMNs and mass spectrometry of EVs.Results:In the animal CLP model, EVs depletion reduced NET formation, lung inflammation and injury. NET components were significantly increased in response to treatment with PMECs-derived EVs in vitro and vivo. NETs inhibition reduced lung inflammation and lung injury after EVs injection intravenously. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that exosomal mitochondrial associated protein induced NET formation through the Fpr1 mediated-NF-KB pathway.Conclusions:EC-derived EVs promote excessive NET formation and aggravate inflammation and subsequent lung injury. This finding suggests a previously unidentified role of EC-derived exosomes in ARDS and may lead to new therapeutic approaches.P057Macrophage-derived LC3 positive extracellular vesicles induce lung microvascular endothelial cell- mediated excessive inflammatory by transferring tRF-1024X Zhu, L LiuSoutheast University, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Critical Care Medicine, Nanjing, ChinaCritical Care2023,27(S1): P057Introduction:Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an unsolved clinical conundrum globally due to its elusive pathogenesis.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an important means of cell–cell signaling by loading nucleic acid and other cargo. tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) is an emerging class of small non-coding RNA molecules that involve in the regulation of multiple physiological processes and diseases. This study describes macrophages-derived LC3+EV mediate PMVECs activation in ARDS and how this process is regulated by LC3+EVs carried-tsRNA.Methods:Flow cytometry absolute count standard was used to quantify LC3+EV in alveolar lavage fluid of patients from ARDS and control groups. Intratracheal instillation model was applied to investigate the effects of endothelial function activation with LC3+EV treatment. RNA sequencing was used to identify the critical tsRNA related to endothelial function. Further evaluation of tsRNA functional was determined through transfecting mimics.Results:Clinically, the number of LC3+EVs had a good predictive value for 28-day mortality of ARDS patients, indicating that LC3+EV is a critical mediator of acute lung injury. Functionally, LC3+EVs up-regulated the level of PMVECs adhesion molecules and increased neutrophil infiltration in vitro and in vivo experiments. Mechanistically, we found the tRF-1024 was closely related to endothelial adhesion function in LC3+EVs and overexpression of tRF-1024 enhanced neutrophil adhesion of PMVECs.Conclusions:Our study uncovers a novel LC3+EV carried-tRF1024 mechanism for the rapid recruitment of neutrophils by PMVEC activation. These findings provide novel insights into PMVEC activation and open a new avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategies in ARDS.P058BM-MSCs attenuate LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by promoting resolvin E1/protectin D1S Yang1, J Liu1, C Li2, YY Pan21Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Suzhou, China,2Department of Critical Care Medicine, Suzhou, ChinaCritical Care2023,27(S1): P058Introduction:Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are respiratory failure caused by excessive alveolar inflammation with high mortality.

Integrative concepts like mechanical power (MP) have been associated with mortality in ARDS, although it is unclear whether information gained from including respiratory rate (RR) [2] reflects rate of deformation (strain rate), rather than repetition [3]. While strain is difficult to measure in clinical settings, stress rate could be a surrogate, but has not yet been studied.Methods:This secondary analysis included adult patients with ARDS from the EPVent2 trial [4]. We defined stress rate as DP over inspiratory time. We investigated its correlation with dynamic parameters including RR and MP on study day 1. As exploratory analysis, the association of DP and stress rate with 28-day mortality was investigated through logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, BMI and SOFA score.Results:193 patients were included. Characteristics of patients by high (> 15.3 cmH2O/s) and low (≤ 15.3 cmH2O/s) stress rate are presented in Table 1. The median (IQR) DP at baseline after study initiation was 12 (10–14) cmH2O. Median inspiratory time was 0.8 (0.7–0.9) s and stress rate was 15 (11–19) cmH2O/s. Stress rate was highly correlated with DP (r = 0.80,p< 0.001) and moderately correlated with RR (r = 0.38,p< 0.001). Low level correlation was observed with MP (r = 0.21,p= 0.02).

The aim of this study is to identify medical devices with inflatable balloons that could be alternatives to traditional esophageal balloon catheters.Methods:Four different balloons were studied: the esophageal (EB) and gastric balloons (GB) of a Blakemore tube (Rüsch©, 18 Ch), the balloon of a Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifesciences©) (SGB) and the balloon of a Foley catheter (Bardia©, 24 Ch) (FB). Each balloon was connected apart to an ICU ventilator (Engström Carestation©) and was studied in vitro. The pressure–volume curves was drawn for each balloon by measuring the pressure for every imposed volume on room atmosphere. A plateau pattern is searched for each balloon to avoid any additional pressure due to balloon wall stretching [1]. Then each balloon was submerged in a water column of a progressive depth of 10, 20 and 30 cm in order to create an external pressure of 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O respectively. The pressure–volume curves were again obtained under these conditions.Results:Zero-plateau curve was only observed for the esophageal (EB) (volume ≤ 45 mL) and gastric (GB) (volume ≤ 10 mL) balloons of the Blakemore tube.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a clinically serious disease that almost always requires hospitalisation and treatment that cannot be delayed or planned. International studies have highlighted the potential negative impact of COVID-19 infection on the onset and severity of the disease. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology, treatment and prognosis of acute pancreatitis at the population level.Methods:Comparison of parameters of hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis, care provided and treatment outcomes during the pandemic (2020 + 2021) with previous years (2010–2019) using data from the National Registry of Covered Health Services. Presentation of pilot data.Results:Hospitalizations for AP increased slightly from 2010 to 2015 to about 7000/year with a relatively stationary number in 2016–2021. Hospitalizations for AP in each month of 2020 and 2021 did not correlate with the number of COVID-19 positive patients and showed a similar trend (with peaks in summer and at the end of the year) as in the years prior to the pandemic. Concurrently with AP, 2.3% and 3.7% of patients had COVID-19 infection in 2020 and 2021, respectively. AP mortality in the pre-pandemic and pandemic years was virtually the same at 3.9%. There was no difference in length of hospital or ICU stay. There was a downward trend in the number of ERCPs and surgical interventions performed.Conclusions:According to pilot population data, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have an impact on the incidence or prognosis of acute pancreatitis in the Czech Republic. Changes in trends in interventions performed correlate with recent expert recommendations and are unlikely to be related to the reduction in care due to the pandemic.P068A nationwide cohort study of pregnant and postpartum patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis in ICU in IsraelE FatnicHadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel, Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Jerusalem,"

We assessed maternal, neonatal outcomes and longitudinal maternal clinical data. The primary outcome was maternal outcome (no-IPPV, IPPV, ECMO, death). The primary longitudinal outcome was SOFA score, the secondary longitudinal outcome was the novel PORCH score (PEEP, Oxygenation, Respiratory-support, Chest-X-ray, Haemodynamic-support). Patients were classified into: “no-delivery”, “postpartum admission”, “delivery-critical” and “delivery-not-critical” groups.Results:84 patients in 13 ICUs were analysed; there were 34 “no-delivery”, 4 “postpartum”, 32 “delivery-critical”, 14 “delivery-not-critical” patients. “Delivery-critical” and “postpartum” had worse outcomes with, 26/32(81%) and 4/4(100%) requiring IPPV; 12/32(38%) and 3/4(75%) requiring ECMO; 1/32(3%) and 2/4(50%) dying. “Delivery-not-critical” and “no-delivery” had far better outcomes with, respectively, 6/34(18%) and 2/14(14%) requiring mechanical ventilation; no patients required ECMO or died. SpO2, S/F ratio, P/F ratio in “Delivery-critical” deteriorated on the day of delivery, continued to deteriorate, and took longer to recover; “delivery-not-critical” improved rapidly following delivery. The day of delivery was a highly significant covariate for PORCH (p< 0.0001), not SOFA (p= 0.09).Conclusions:Interventional delivery should be considered for maternal indications before patients deteriorate and require IPPV.P069Sars-CoV-2 in critical immunocompromised patients.

At ICU admission, it is unknown which patients require HDS. Obtaining insights in their inflammatory state by using biomarkers and determining their association with the effect of HDS could support decision-making. The goal of this study is to compare the patient characteristics and biomarker profiles at ICU admission of the patients that received HDS to the patients who did not.Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study including COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of the Erasmus MC between 2020 and 2022. The primary intervention was treatment with HDS, defined as 1000 mg methylprednisolone or > 40 mg prednisolone for three consecutive days. We compared demographics, comorbidities, biomarkers and mortality between patients treated with HDS and without. Logistic regression multivariate analyses was used to analyze which biomarkers were associated with initiation of HDS.Results:We included 151 patients, of which 48 were treated with HDS at a median of 6 days after ICU admission (Table 1). There were no significant differences in demographics and comorbidities. Patients treated with HDS had a significantly longer ICU length of stay (p< 0.001) and higher hospital mortality rate (p< 0.001).

We examined the effectiveness of Bam given in a coordinated community wide initiative in reducing ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths during the first 30 days post-treatment.Methods:Bam treated adults at a community-based (CB) infusion center in the SW USA were identified in a regional EMR database covering all local hospitals. Individual patients were de-identified but tracked for 30 days for ED visits, hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths. Patient demographics including age, sex and ethnicity were recorded. Our local IRB approved the project as exempt.Results:A total of 2242 patients received Bam between 11/2020 and 3/2021, while the Wuhan variant was predominant. The mean age was 52, 54% were female and 64% identified as Hispanic or Latino. During the 30 days post infusion 13% of patients visited the ED, but only 2% of the total patients were admitted, 0.6% were admitted to the ICU and 14 died (0.6%). For comparison, a historical placebo control group of COVID patients in Chen et al. [1] is shown in Table 1. Hospitalizations among patients over 60 occurred at the same rate as the total cohort versus more than double the rate in older patients in the control group.Conclusions:A CB Bam infusion program reduced ED visits, and hospitalizations, particularly among older patients, with a smaller reduction in ICU admissions and death.

Dexamethasone is the cornerstone in the therapy of C-ARDS and reduces mortality probably by suppressing inflammatory levels in ICU patients. Its anti-inflammatory effects may be concentration-related. However, no pharmacokinetic studies of dexamethasone have been conducted in ICU patients. Therefore, we designed a population pharmacokinetic study to gain a deeper understanding of the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone in critically ill patients in order to identify relevant covariates that can be used to personalize dosing regimens and improve clinical outcomes.Methods:This was a retrospective pilot study at the ICU of the Erasmus Medical Center. Blood samples were collected in adults at the ICU with COVID who were treated with fixed dose intravenous dexamethasone (6 mg/day). The data were analyzed using Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modelling (NONMEM) software for population pharmacokinetic analysis and clinically relevant covariates were selected and evaluated.Results:A total of 51 dexamethasone samples were measured in 18 patients. A two-compartment model with first-order kinetics best fitted the data. The mean population estimates for drug clearance and inter-compartment clearance were 2.85 L/h (IIV 62.9%) and 2.11 L/h, respectively, and central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 15.4 L and 12.3 L, respectively. The covariate analysis showed a significant correlation between dexamethasone clearance and CRP. Dexamethasone clearance decreased significantly with increasing CRP in the range of 0–50 mg/L and a correlation was observed with CRP up to 100 mg/L.Conclusions:The dexamethasone PK parameters of ICU COVID patients were quite different from those come from healthy populations.

Vilobelimab (VILO), a C5a-specific monoclonal antibody, improved mortality in severe COVID-19 patients (pts) in a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled study [1]. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis was undertaken to assess VILO and C5a as well as antidrug antibodies (ADA) levels in the study.Methods:Forty-six (46) hospitals on four continents randomized 369 COVID-19 pts (VILO [n = 178], PLC [n = 191]) within 48 h of being mechanically ventilated to receive 6, 800 mg infusions of VILO or PLC at a 1:1 ratio on top of standard of care. Blood samples were taken at screening, Day 8 and at hospital discharge for VILO and C5a and at screening and hospital discharge for ADA. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were used to analyze levels.Results:Screening blood samples for VILO and C5a were available for VILO (n = 93) and PLC (n = 99) from sites in Western Europe. On Day 8 after 3 infusions, mean VILO trough concentrations were 21799.3–302972.1 ng/mL (geometric mean 137881.3 ng/mL) (Fig. 1). At screening, C5a was highly elevated and comparable between groups: VILO median 118.3 ng/mL, mean 130.3 ng/mL, PLC median 104.6 ng/mL, mean 123.2 ng/mL. By Day 8, C5a levels were reduced by 84.6% in the VILO group (median 14.5 ng/mL [mean 16.8 ng/mL],p< 0.001) versus a 19.6% increase in the PLC group (median, 119.2 ng/mL, mean 129.8 ng/mL). Beyond Day 8, though PD sampling was sparse, C5a levels remained elevated for PLC whereas C5a slowly rose but did not reach screening levels for VILO. Treatment-induced ADA were observed in 1 pt in the VILO group (Day 40 discharge) and 1 pt in the PLC group (Day 25 discharge), both appeared independent of treatment.Conclusions:The PK/PD analysis shows that VILO efficiently inhibits C5a in pts with severe COVID-19 resulting in a robust clinical effect on mortality reduction without inducing ADA.ReferenceVlaar APJ et al.

Its pathogenesis is unclear and it is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and necrosis of parenchymal cells.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the radiological findings of COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU during the pandemic in order to identify the development of lung cavitary lesions.Results:From 11/2020 until 10/2022 1000 patients were admitted to our COVID-19 ICU (92% on invasive mechanical ventilation). According to our data there were three cases of lung cavity formation. The first case was a 78 years male with history of hypertension. Chest CT (Day26) showed a 11.6 cm cavity in the right middle lobe (Fig. 1). The second case was a 52 year old female with history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. Follow up chest CT (D29) revealed progressive development of multiple bilateral cavitary lesions. The third case was a 61 year old male with no medical history, who developed (D17) multiple cavitary lesions in both lower lobes, concomitant with left-sided pulmonary embolism. The presence of other well defined etiologies of cavitary lesions such as mycobacterial and fungal infections as well as neoplasmatic or autoimmune diseases had been widely excluded. However, since pulmonary cavitation is a late complication of severe COVID disease, we cannot overlook the fact that all patients suffered from superinfections by XDR Acinetobacter baumanii and/or Klebsiella pneumonia, as most of our patients with prolonged length of stay. Moreover, two of the three patients developed pneumothorax. All patients finally died.Conclusions:Although bacterial co-infection does not allow absolute association between cavitary formation and coronavirus disease, it seems that destructive triggers, such as bacteria or mechanical ventilation, may aggravate COVID underlying lung lesions leading to cavitation.Fig. 1 (abstract P079).

In this study we aimed to describe lung inhomogeneities in COVID-19 related ARDS (C-ARDS) and to relate these to disease severity and lung morphology.Methods:We enrolled patients with C-ARDS within 3 days from mechanical ventilation start, deeply sedated and paralyzed. Lung CT scan was obtained at PEEP of 5 cmH2O to measure lung weight compartments (non-, poorly-, well- and over-aerated). Lung inhomogeneities were computed as the gas/tissue ratio of each voxel compared to the neighboring voxels. We considered values > 1.61 as pathologic lung inhomogeneities, as previously described [1]. The fraction of total lung volume with pathologic inhomogeneities (“extent”) and the average severity of inhomogeneities contained in that fraction (“intensity”) was calculated. Respiratory system compliance and blood gas analysis were obtained at the same PEEP level of the CT scan. Some results have been presented in another publication [2].Results:Forty patients were studied in the supine position 1 (0–1) days after ICU admission. The extent of pathologic lung inhomogeneities represented 18 ± 4% of total lung volume. The intensity of pathologic lung inhomogeneities was on average 2.53 ± 0.12. “Extent” was positively correlated with the amount of poorly aerated lung weight (r2= 0.51,p< 0.001) (Fig. 1) and negatively correlated with the amount of non-aerated lung weight (r2= 0.22,p= 0.002). No correlation was found between “extent” and “intensity” and PaO2/FiO2, dead space fraction or respiratory system compliance.Conclusions:In C-ARDS lung inhomogeneities represent roughly 20% of total lung volume.

Mixed model analysis corrected for individual center effects and adjusted for age, sex, vaccination status, use of steroids and anticoagulants was used.Results:There was no difference in age, sex and BMI between groups. CO patients had more comorbidities [mean difference (MD) 0.7, 95% CI (0.5–1.0),p= 0.02], especially arterial hypertension, and higher SAPS II score [MD 0.0 (0–0.1),p< 0.001], SOFA score [MD 0.1 (0.1–0.3),p< 0.0001]. CO patients presented with higher cardiovascular system SOFA subscore, but better PF-ratio at ICU admission and smaller risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation throughout their ICU stay [OR 0.5 (0.3–0.8)]. There was no difference in ECMO treatments, ICU length of stay [MD 0.6 (0–11.4),p= 0.72] or ICU survival [HR 1 (0.7–1.5),p= 0.88] between the two groups.Conclusions:We show that critically ill CO patients present with more comorbidities, less severe respiratory disease but more severe hemodynamic instability at ICU admission as compared to CD patients, although the ICU length of stay and mortality was similar. These differences could be explained by differences in disease characteristics caused by CO, or by the increasing prevalence of CO as co-factor to preexisting disease. Continued monitoring of critically ill CO patients in ICUs worldwide is warranted.ReferencesIuliano AD et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2022;71:146–152.Wendel-Garcia PD et al.

We aimed to examine the predictive value of APACHE II score in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to our 50-bed ICU between October 2020 and April 2022. Using a ROC analysis we assessed the performance of APACHE II score and identified the optimal cut-off value for mortality prediction.Results:Our cohort included 783 patients (66% male) with positive PCR forSARS-Cov-2 and respiratory failure. Mean age was 66 years. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 92%of patients and 89.3% had at least one comorbidity. The mean APACHE II score of the whole cohort was 20.3 (± 8.5). ICU mortality was 44.7%. Death rate was similar between sexes but significantly higher in those who were older and those suffering from COPD, chronic renal or heart failure, atrial fibrillation or any kind of malignancy. Non-survivors had a significantly higher APACHE II score compared to survivors (25.2 ± 7.9 vs 16.3 ± 6.7,p< 0.001). ROC analysis showed an AUC 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.84,p< 0.001). At a cut-off value of 19.5 APACHE II score could predict death with a sensitivity of 77.1% (95% CI 72.4–81.4%), a specificity of 70.7% (95% CI 66.1–74.9%), PPV 68% (95% CI 63.2–72.6%) and NPV 79.3% (95% CI 74.9–83.2%).Conclusions:APACHE II score is an effective tool for mortality prediction in critically ill COVID-19 patients. A cut-off value of 19.5 can be used for risk stratification in this patient population.P086Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19: profile of usage and potential deleterious impact on morbidity and"

In patients with moderate-severe ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (CARDS), NDMB were used for prolonged periods of time, with high cumulative doses. We hypothesize that administration of NDMB might contribute to an increased incidence of risk factors later associated with long COVID-19.Methods:We designed a non-interventional, retrospective study in a large university urban hospital. From January to December 2021, data related to prescription of NDMB, respiratory physiology, mechanical ventilation (IMV) and clinical outcomes were collected from patients’ electronic records with a diagnosis of CARDS. Primary outcome was day-90 mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU length of stay (LOS), ICU-acquired weakness and days of IMV. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables and logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of NDMB use with outcomes, adjusted or not for confounders.Results:116 patients diagnosed with CARDS were included, 87% with severe ARDS and overall mortality was 37.1%. Median age was 57 years (IQ:47–67) and 65.5% were male. P:F ratio at day-1 was 86 (IQ:43). Ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days was 13 (IQ:0–19) in survivors and ICU-LOS was 19 (IQ:10–36). Median time and cumulative dose of NDMB were, respectively, 117 h and 1177.468 mg in patients who survived (n = 70) compared to 197 h and 1898.775 mg in patients who died (n = 41). In addition to days of NDMB exposure (OR 1.05, CI 95% 1.00–1.11), the cumulative dose of cisatracurium, expressed in logs, was correlated with risk of mortality in the ICU, with odds ratio 1.49 (CI 95% 1.08–2.04).Conclusions:Patients with severe forms of CARDS received prolonged infusions of NDMB, with high cumulative doses. Both time of exposure and total doses were independently associated with higher risk of mortality.P087Prolonged prone position in COVID-19-associated ARDS: a prospective studyG Karlis1, S Kakavas2, M Poulou1, D Bakali1, G Katsagani1, M Daganou1, D Markantonaki11Thoracic Diseases General Hospital Sotiria, Polyvalent ICU, Athens, Greece,2Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, GreeceCritical Care2023,27(S1): P087Introduction:Ventilation in prone-position (PP) improves survival in moderate-to-severe ARDS.

We included consecutive intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS and positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 who underwent at least one session of PP from March 2021 to August 2021. PP was undertaken if P/F < 150 with FiO2> 0.6 and PEEP > 10cmH2O. Oxygenation parameters and respiratory mechanics were recorded before PP, at the end of PP session and 4 h after supine repositioning. Patients with PP longer than 24 h (prolonged group) were compared to patients who were proned for less than 24 h (control group). The duration of PP was at the discretion of the treating intensivist.Results:We recorded 56 patients (62.7% male). Five patients were excluded because PP was terminated in less than 4 h. Mean age of the 51 studied patients was 61.4 years. Patients in the prolonged group had significantly higher BMI than controls. Baseline oxygenation and respiratory mechanics were similar between groups. PP duration was 39.8 versus 20.5 h (p< 0.001). Increase of P/F was higher in the prolonged PP group during proning (103.8 ± 70.8 vs 66 ± 53.9,p< 0.05) and after supination (76.3 ± 64.6 vs 48.6 ± 34.9,p= 0.058). No change in respiratory mechanics was observed in either group. 28-day survival was 75% in the prolonged PP group and 69.5% in the control group (p= 0.665). Duration of mechanical ventilation, number of PP cycles and rate of complications were similar between groups.Conclusions:In patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 prolonged PP resulted in better oxygenation, but had no impact on outcome.

The most common type of barotrauma was subcutaneous emphysema (52.4%, CI 95% 37.3–67.5%), followed by pneumomediastinum (47.6%, CI 95% 32.5–62.7%) and pneumothorax (35.7%, IC 95% 21.2–50.2%). The median time to diagnosis was 11.5 days after initiation of ventilatory support [interval 1–67]. In the COVID-19 group, barotrauma was associated with longer ventilation (14.06 vs 7.91 days,p< 0.001), longer ICU stay (16.74 vs 8.17 days,p< 0.001) e higher mortality rates (45.0% vs 26.2%, RR 1.72, p 0.011).Conclusions:We found a higher susceptibility to developing barotrauma as a potential complication of COVID-19 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. From those, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum seem to be more prevalent than pneumothorax.

A delay in ECMO initiation could worsen the outcome and prolong the duration of treatment. The study aims to describe the incidence of mortality in our intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with severe COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated with VV ECMO.Methods:We performed an observational retrospective study, including patients with severe COVID-19-related ARDS admitted to our ICU and treated with VV ECMO between February 2020 and February 2022. We collected data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, mechanical ventilation, therapies, laboratory results, VV ECMO and ICU mortality. SOFA score, SAPS II and Charlson Comorbidity Index were calculated at ICU admission.Results:The average age of our cohort of 60 patients was 54.4 ± 7.7 years and 51 (85%) were males. The mean value of the SOFA score at ICU admission was 7 ± 2.3 points, and the median value of the SAPS II score was 41 [31–48] points. The incidence of mortality in the whole cohort was 48.3%.

A longer duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO placement and traditional ICU prognostic scores seem not to be relevant for the prognosis.Table 1 (abstract P089).

In vivo hemolysis (ivH) is one of its complications, characterised by peaks of plasma free hemoglobin (fHb). However, an increase in carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) has also been observed due to Hb metabolism by heme-oxygenase that releases carbon monoxide. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of ivH events and their relation to COHb in COVID-19 patients undergoing ECMO.Methods:Single-centre observational retrospective study that included 33 COVID-19 patients with ARDS who received VV-ECMO treatment in the ICU from March 2020 to September 2021. Daily analytical monitoring was carried out including arterial blood gas test with cooximetry and biochemical parameters, incorporating the estimation of fHb using quantitative hemolysis index (HI). Significant ivH was considered with fHb > 50 mg/dL after discarding in vitro hemolysis. Daily maximum values of HI and COHb were recorded and paired in order to evaluate their correlation by generalised linear model.Results:The total prevalence of patients having ivH in our cohort was 27.3%. Mortality during ECMO treatment in our study was 57.6%, higher within the group of patients with ivH events (77.8% vs 50%).

Reversible pupil dilation under rocuronium treatment has been described in case reports [1, 2]. We report a retrospective analysis of patients receiving continuous rocuronium or vecuronium to investigate the occurrence of pupil dilation.Methods:Nursing data on pupil size were collected retrospectively from all adult patients receiving a continuous infusion of rocuronium or vecuronium, both during and before/after the infusion. Reversible bilateral pupil dilation ≥ 4 mm that was not responsive to light was defined as dilation. Patients with an organic cause of dilated pupils were excluded.Results:Data on 197 patients admitted from 2019 to 2022 were analyzed. Rocuronium only was administered to 42 (21%) patients, vecuronium only to 134 (67%) patients and both to 23 (12%) patients. For rocuronium, transient pupil dilation occurred in 2/42 (5%) patients during treatment versus 2/42 (5%) different patients before or after treatment. Pupils were dilated for 34 ± 19 (20 ± 5%) hours during therapy versus 10 ± 6 (8 ± 4%) hours before or after therapy. For vecuronium transient pupil dilation occurred in 3/134 (2%) patients during treatment versus 4/134 (3%) other patients before or after treatment. Pupils were dilated for 12 ± 6 (23 ± 31%) hours during therapy versus 52 ± 28 (13 ± 10%) before or after therapy.Conclusions:Pupil dilation seems to be more common during muscle relaxant therapy than before or after. Overall pupil dilation under muscle relaxants is rare, but seemed more common during rocuronium therapy than vecuronium. The small numbers precluded statistical significance. Familiarity with this potential side effect of rocuronium (which can be reversed with sugammadex) is important as it may prevent unnecessary CT exams in ventilated patients.ReferencesZakynthinos GE et al.

Prompt recognition and early treatment of a MH crisis improve survival rate. Inhaled sedation with volatile anaesthetic agents has been made feasible in intensive care unit (ICU) with the development of the anaesthetic conserving device (AnaConDa®) [2]. With its rising popularity among the intensivists, it calls for a MH crisis preparation plan for the ICU [3]. The objective of this study is to assess MH awareness, knowledge and crisis preparedness among ICU staff.Methods:An online questionnaire was sent to staff working in the operating theatre (OT) and ICU in Changi General Hospital Singapore between August to October 2022. Staff included are doctors working in the anaesthesia department, nurses and attendants in the OT, ICU nurses and respiratory therapists. The survey consists of 16 single or multiple-choice questions on MH knowledge and crisis preparedness.Results:Out of the 283 responders, 49.5% (140) are unsure or unaware of MH, among which ICU staff accounts for 71.5% (100). Among 114 ICU staff, only 14.0% correctly identified the signs and symptoms of MH or knew dantrolene is the drug of treatment. 17 people had prior encounters with MH either in ICU or OT settings, among them only 53% (9) chose the correct drug and dose of dantrolene. Majority of the ICU staff are not aware of the hospital MH protocol or availability of MH cart and 99.1% expressed lack of confidence in handling MH crisis (Fig. 1).Conclusions:MH is a low-frequency, high fatality emergency in ICU. Current data showed a lack of awareness and preparedness for MH crisis among the staffs especially ICU colleagues.

Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) were used to assess pain in patients able to communicate and Critical Care Pain Observational Tool (CPOT) for non-communicating patients. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of moderate to severe pain during intensive care (NRS ≥ 4/CPOT ≥ 3/VRS ≥ moderate pain). We collected data including pain intensity and other pain related factors during first 10 days in the ICU.Results:76% patients experienced moderate to severe pain during at least one of ten days of follow up in the ICU. Age below 64 years old, female gender and history of chronic pain was associated with higher number of days in moderate to severe pain. There was not significant difference between surgical and non-surgical groups of patients in the days they experienced moderate to severe pain. Pain scores throughout 10 days follow up are presented in Fig. 1.Conclusions:Our results indicate that majority of patients experienced moderate to severe pain during ICU stay.

In the multimodal group pregabaline 75 mg, dexmedetomidine, ketamine and lidocaine was given versus liberal fentanyl and remifentanil in the opioid group. Postoperative pain was scored every 8 h by the NRS-scale/CPOT score in the awake/sedated patient. Delirium postoperatively is measured by the ICDSC-score. Time to extubation, LOS in ICU, LOS in hospital and rescue pain medication are compared between both groups.Results:Ninety-six patients were successfully enrolled. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups. The multimodal pain scheme was administered in 46 patients, while 50 patients received the opioid based scheme. After linear mixed model analysis no significant differences were seen in CPOT-score (p= 0.305), NRS-score (p= 0.182) (Fig. 1), consumption in rescue pain medication and ICDSC-score (p= 0.267).

No significant difference could be found in pain, delirium, intubation time or LOS in hospital between multimodal analgesia versus an opioid-based analgetic protocol in cardiac surgery by sternotomy.

We examined whether a Serratus Anterior Plane Block (SAPB), placed on arrival at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), in addition to standard-of-care after TEAVR could improve the quality of postoperative pain management.Methods:We performed the first double-blinded randomized controlled trial on 75 patients undergoing TEAVR. Patients allocated to the intervention arm received a SAPB on ICU arrival when the patient was sedated. SAPB was placed by a block team, leaving the attending anesthesiologist, surgical team and critical care team blinded. Ultrasound-guided SAPB was performed on the right hemithorax at T2-T5 level: 30 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% was injected under the serratus anterior (SA) muscle and 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25% was administered between the latissimus dorsi and"

Sedation was provided by means of dexmedetomidine.Results:Thirty-seven patients were allocated to the control versus 38 to the SAPB group. Patients receiving SAPB suffered significantly less pain at 4, 8 and 24 h postoperatively (p values: 0.05, 0.03 and 0.04 respectively) (Fig. 1).

Remifentanil and fentanyl are strong opioids widely used intraoperatively due to their potency and pharmacokinetic properties. We designed a study to evaluate associations between these opioids and critical care and clinical outcomes in patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC.Methods:A historical cohort of patients taken to CRS-HIPEC from 2007 to 2020 at a university hospital in Bogota, Colombia was analyzed retrospectively. We compared outcomes of patients who received intraoperative remifentanil (group R) or fentanyl (group F). Primary outcome was ICU length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes were total LOS, ICU readmission, inpatient mortality, time vented, need for tracheostomy, time to ambulation and oral feeds, need for transfusion, estimated blood loss, intraoperative crystalloids, and units of red blood cells and plasma transfused in surgery. We excluded patients with incomplete medical records or whose procedure was palliative.Results:A total of 173 patients were included in the analysis.

Fentanyl was initially titrated until Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was < 4 and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) -2 to 0. Patients received fentanyl 20 mcg/hour continuously with either ketamine (Group K) or placebo (Group C). Ketamine 0.09 mg/kg/hour (1.5 mg/kg/min) was administrated in Group K, and 0.9%NaCl was administrated at the same rate in Group C. The ICU nurse assessed NRS and RASS score in every 4 h and gave extra fentanyl bolus intravenously to keep the patients’ NRS < 4 and RASS 0 to − 2.Results:118 patients were included in the study.

Use of enteral clonidine (CLN) to wean off DEX and manage withdrawal has become more prevalent in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between DEX exposure and initiation of CLN in adult patients in the ICU.Methods:A single-centered, retrospective cohort study was conducted in adult ICU patients admitted between January 1, 2021 and July 31, 2022 who received at least 48 h of continuous DEX. Patients weaned off DEX alone were compared to patients weaned with enteral CLN. The primary outcome was time (days) from start of wean to cessation of DEX. Secondary outcomes included DEX exposure and CLN utilization. Withdrawal (RASS > 1, HR > 100, and re-initiation of DEX or start of CLN within 48 h of DEX cessation) was assessed in patients weaned off DEX alone.Results:A total of 267 patient encounters were included. Total days on DEX was greater in the CLN group (6 vs. 3 days). Days on DEX prior to wean were similar between groups, with no difference in weight-based dose of DEX (1 vs. 1 mcg/kg/hr). Time from start of wean to cessation of DEX was longer in the CLN group (3 vs. 0 days). The most common initial CLN regimen was 0.1 mg every 8 h, with a median total daily CLN dose of 0.4 mg at time of DEX cessation. At 48 h, 18.1% of patients weaned off DEX alone were re-initiated on DEX or started on CLN.Conclusions:Use of enteral CLN to wean DEX may reduce rates of DEX resumption due to iatrogenic withdrawal.ReferencesBhatt K et al.

After postoperative admission to the ICU, polysomnography and BIS were recorded overnight and the data were obtained for analyses. The primary outcome of this study was BIS index best predicting good sleep quality. We defined postoperative sleep quality by polysomnographic sleep efficiency more than 85%.Results:Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (Fig. 1) was created to determine the averaged BIS index associated with good postoperative sleep quality. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.65. The optimal cut-off with best differentiation derived from Youden’s Index was 75 with sensitivity 68% and specificity 56%.

However, this sedation therapy is associated with a high incidence of benzodiazepine-related delirium and an increased number of days spent in coma. Given the high midazolam dose requirements in some patients and due to the renal clearance (CL) of the active metabolite 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide (OHmidazolamGluc), ICU patients with COVID-19 and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may are at risk of prolonged sedation.

Subsequently, the CL and delivered renal dose were corrected for downtime therapy and filter integrity by a filter urea ratio.Results:We included 4 cases of CVVHD and 2 cases of CVVHDF. Midazolam, OHmidazolam and OHmidazolamGluc concentrations in μg/l ranged from 0 to 6070, 0 to 295 and 1727 to 39,000, respectively. SCs ranged from 0.02 to 0.03 for midazolam, 0.05 to 0.06 for OHmidazolam and 0.23–0.43 for OHmidazolamGluc. The CL in ml/min by the delivered renal dose was 0.82–1.67 for midazolam, 2.20–3.46 for OHmidazolam and 4.0–27.65 for OHmidazolamGluc. The CL in ml/min by the corrected renal dose was 0.68–1.50, 1.83–2.33 and 3.40–25.4, respectively. The urea ratios were 0.53 to 1.0.Conclusions:Midazolam and OHmidazolam are not removed efficiently by CRRT and OHmidazolamGluc approximately up to 43%. Type of CRRT, filter integrity and downtime of CRRT affect the CL of midazolam and metabolites. Our results have implications for more personalized titration of midazolam in COVID-19 patients with CRRT, mainly to avoid oversedation.P101Incidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus during prolonged sevoflurane sedation in the intensive care unit: a retrospective analysisKVE Van Eeckhout1, BS Sol2, JG Glissenaar3, JP Poelaert1, BB Bravenboer4, JDF De Filette51Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Intensive Care Unit, Jette, Belgium,2AZ Alma, Endocrinology, Eeklo, Belgium,3Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Jette, Belgium,4Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Endocrinology, Jette, Belgium,5CHU Brugmann, Endocrinology, Brussels, BelgiumCritical Care2023,27(S1): P101Introduction:Sevoflurane is a halogenated inhalational anesthetic used for maintenance anesthesia. It is used in the intensive care unit (ICU), not in the least because of its potentially beneficial effects in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. However, polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) were observed with its long-term administration. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of NDI during prolonged sevoflurane sedation.Methods:A retrospective analysis of patients receiving prolonged sevoflurane sedation (> 24 h) at the University Hospital of Brussels from 2013 to March 2021 was performed. The diagnosis of NDI was ‘confirmed’ in the presence of polyuria (urine output > 40 ml/kg/24 h), hypernatremia > 145 mmol/l, plasma osmolality > 295 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg, and no or minimal response to exogenous desmopressin administration.

DEX, a selective alfa-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, widely used for its sedative and analgesic properties, has been linked to increasing parasympathetic tone, reducing the inflammatory response and oxidative stress [1]. Since severe COVID-19 is associated with an hyperinflammatory state, it is hypothesized that DEX might improve outcomes in these patients.Methods:This is a retrospective observational study of mechanically ventilated patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICU of a tertiary center in Portugal, between March 2020 and December 2021. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of DEX use and 28-day mortality from time of intubation.Results:A total of 277 patients were analyzed, 151 in the DEX group and 126 in the no DEX group. Patients in the DEX group were younger (53.3 vs. 63.3 years,p< 0.001), had less comorbidities (2.8 vs. 3.5,p= 0.01), lower SOFA at admission (6.2 vs. 7.1,p= 0.01) but had a prolonged ICU stay (21.4 vs. 15.9,p< 0.001).

PaO2/FiO2ratio at admission (111.1 vs. 108.1,p= 0.61), days spent in RASS < 3 (13.7 vs. 12.4,p= 0.31) and opioid use (14.8 vs. 13.1,p= 0.16) were also similar. From time of intubation, 28-day mortality in the cohort receiving DEX was 14.7% compared to 59.5% in the no DEX group (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.07–0.21;p= 0.01).Conclusions:Use of DEX was associated with lower 28-day mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in our study analysis.

PHB has demonstrated safety and comparative efficacy in reduction of withdrawal symptoms [2,3]. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of PHB for the treatment of severe AWS in the MICU.Methods:This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included patients ≥ 18 years of age admitted January 1, 2021, through July 31, 2022, to the MICU service for management of AWS. Patients who received diazepam monotherapy were compared to patients who received ≥ 1 dose of PHB ± diazepam for AWS. The primary outcome was to assess the difference in rate of intubation within 72 h of PHB administration compared to diazepam.Results:A total of 67 PHB encounters and 98 diazepam monotherapy encounters were included, which yielded intubation rates of 55% and 41.4% within the 72-h timeframe, respectively. The most frequent indication for intubation within the 72-h timeframe was for airway protection which occurred in 54.6% of PHB intubations and 70.8% of diazepam monotherapy intubations. The mean PHB dose administered was 479.98 mg/dose (SD ± 223.3) or 6.48 mg/kg/dose (SD ± 2.97) based on ideal body weight. Mean diazepam dose administered over 72 h was 97.25 mg (SD ± 101.54) in the diazepam monotherapy group.Conclusions:The use of PHB for control of AWS was associated with a higher rate of intubation compared to the diazepam group.ReferencesDixit D et al.

Reason for admission in the VPA group was mostly TBI (62.8%) and causes of agitation were multifactorial. 97.4% were mechanically ventilated. The percentage of agitation-free patients was 6.5% on Day 1, 14.1% on Day 3 and 39.5% on Day 7 where Day 1 = day of VPA initiation.The percentage of patients with at least one ARE was highest on Day 1 with 14.3% and lowest on Day 4 with 6.76%. Multivariate regression model for variables identified female sex (n = 12) as predictor of response on Day 7 (OR 6.10 [1.18–31.64]). A significant effect of VPA on agitation was not observed when controlling for confounding variables.Conclusions:Although VPA was associated with a decrease in agitation and ARE in the 7 days following initiation, its effect when controlling for confouding variables did not yield significant results. Prospective placebo-controlled studies are warranted to assess the natural evolution of agitation and the true impact of VPA on agitation and ARE in this population.P107Valproic acid for the treatment of ICU agitation and deliriumRM Nelson, TS Lam, KA Considine, JT JancikHennepin Healthcare, Pharmacy, Minneapolis, USACritical Care2023,27(S1): P107Introduction:Agitation and delirium are common in the intensive care setting. Rates of agitation and delirium in ICU patients have been reported up to 70% and 89% respectively [1,2]. Previous studies have demonstrated that use of valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with reductions in agitation and delirium in the ICU [3–5]. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of VPA on resolution of ICU agitation and delirium when prescribed at comparable or higher doses than previously published.Methods:This single-center retrospective analysis was conducted in adult patients admitted between 01 Jun 2018 and 31 May 2022 who were prescribed VPA for agitation or delirium in the ICU. Agitation was defined as a RASS greater than or equal to 2 for at least 2 occurrences per calendar day. Delirium was defined as a positive CAM-ICU for at least 2 occurrences per calendar day. The primary objective was time to resolution of agitation or delirium from VPA initiation.Results:The analysis included 177 patient encounters. Agitation or delirium was present in 61.0% and 94.4% of patients respectively. Agitation resolved in 85.2% of patients with median time to resolution of 3 days (IQR 4).

The aim of this study is to evaluate cognitive impairments at the time of discharge from the surgical intensive care unit and identify the incidence and risk factors of cognitive impairments.Methods:A prospective study was conducted from July 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022. The participants were adult patients who stayed in the surgical intensive care unit for more than 48 h. At the time of discharge from the ICU, cognitive function was evaluated with with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the risk factors (general, disease, treatment-related characteristics) of cognitive impairment were analyzed.Results:In this study, the prevalence of cognitive impairments was 41.8% (64/153). As a result of analyzing the factors related to the occurrence of cognitive impairments, age, education level, living with family, and history of cerebrovascular diseases, CCI, delirium, use of sedatives, length of stay in ICU, use of insulin were different between groups (Table 1). According to multivariate regression, lower education level, history of cerebrovascular diseases, prolonged delirium, prolonged hyperglycemia, and absence of caregiver were identified as a predictive factors of cognitive impairment at the time if discharge from ICU.Conclusions:The cognitive impairment was relatively high. The correction of modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment such as prevention of delirium and hyperglycemia can attenuate cognitive dysfunction. It is necessary to develop and apply an individual and step-by-step cognitive rehabilitation program considering the characteristics of the patient by assessing the level of education and the history of cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke.Table 1 (abstract P108).

Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of developing delirium during hospitalization. The focus of our study was to investigate existing literature to determine whether, at hospital admission, serum concentration of a biomarker for systemic inflammation, interleukin (IL)-6, was associated with the likelihood of developing delirium during hospitalization. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate that question.Methods:Our meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Independent extraction with multiple reviewers' consensus was used to determine the studies included. The weight and heterogeneity of the manuscripts were calculated using inverse covariance with a random-effects model. The inclusion criteria were articles that investigated links between serum concentration of IL-6 at hospital admission and delirium during hospitalization.Results:After excluding duplicates, sixteen studies that investigated the role of IL-6 serum concentration at hospital admission were included. Our search found evidence that patients who developed delirium during hospitalization had, at hospital admission, a mean serum concentration of IL-6 significantly greater than patients who did not develop delirium during hospitalization. The mean difference in IL-6 serum concentration was independent of other confounding variables such as the patient’s severity of illness. The mean difference in serum concentration of IL-6 at hospital admission between patients who developed delirium and those who did not was 24.05 pg/ml,p< 0.00001.Conclusions:Our findings indicate that a greater serum concentration of IL-6 at hospital admission is associated with an increased risk of developing delirium during hospitalization.Fig. 1 (abstract P109)Forest plot showing mean difference in IL-6 serum concentrations at hospital admission between patients who develop delirium and who do not develop delirium during hospitalizationP110Thiamine supplementation and delirium occurrence in the intensive care unitMA Mumin1, C McKenzie2, L Aitken3, D Hadfield4, F Hanks5, J Yick6, V Page7, B Blackwood8, D McAuley8, P Spronk91Pharmacy, King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Pharmacy, London, UK,2Perioperative and Critical Care Theme, Southampton NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, UK,3School of Health and Psychological Sciences, City, University of London, London, UK,4Critical Care, King’s College"

Thiamine di-phosphate (TDP), the active form of thiamine, is an essential cofactor in glucose metabolism, glutamate transformation and acetylcholinesterase activity; all reported in delirium occurrence [1].Methods:An anonymized, approved patient dataset was obtained from consecutive ICU admissions over two periods in Gelre Hospitals, Netherlands; October 2014–October 2016 (period 1) and April 2017–April 2019 (period 2). Routine scheduled prescription of IV thiamine, 300 to 600 mg within 72 h of admission, followed by 100 mg daily for 5 days, began in October 2016 after reporting of low whole blood thiamine [2]. Delirium was defined as 1 or more positive confusion assessment method-intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) score in 24 h. PREDELIRIC scores were calculated as a measure of prediction of delirium [3].Results:There was a total of 3074 ICU admissions recorded. In period one, 111 of 1508 (7%) received IV thiamine, compared to 937 of 1566 (60%) patients during period 2 (Table 1). Data eligible for PREDELIRIC risk assessment was available for only 575 (38%) and 549 (35%) patients in period 1 and 2 respectively. Our analysis reported a reduction in delirium incidence during period 2 (0.16), compared to period 1 (0.20); OR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.65–0.94;p= 0.009]. There was no change in the mean PREDELIRIC score between period 1 and period 2, 0.30 (± 0.11).Conclusions:IV thiamine administration may reduce delirium occurrence in the ICU; although it did not appear to confer benefit in those at greater risk of delirium. Limitations include low adherence to IV thiamine regime in period 2, and observational and retrospective data. Future work should focus on mechanism of thiamine in delirium and randomised control efficacy trials.ReferencesKealy J et al. JNeurosci 2020;40:5681–5696.van Snippenburg W et al.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 is associated with increased delirium rates through various mechanisms including hypoxaemia, circulation of inflammatory mediators and direct central nervous system damage [2]. Due to life-threatening respiratory manifestations in COVID-19 patients delirium is often underestimated. Aim of the study was to record the pharmacologic treatment of delirium in ICU patients treated with non-invasive ventilation and the differences in delirium treatment between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.Methods:Consecutive patients with respiratory failure were retrospectively included. All patients were hospitalized in the ICU and non-invasive ventilation was applied. Patient characteristics, length of ICU stay and medication were recorded.Results:Totally 64 patients were included (33 patients with COVID-19). Pharmacologic management of delirium included administration of remifentanyl, dexmedetomidine, propofol and combinations of the above. COVID-19 patients were younger (61 vs 70.4 years,p= 0.02), had longer ICU hospitalization (p< 0.001) and needed longer intravenous medication administration (p= 0.001). Additionally, the proportion of patients with COVID-19 treated with intravenous medication due to delirium was higher than non-COVID-19 patients (81.8% vs 48.4%,p= 0.008). COVID-19 seemed to have worse outcomes than non-COVID-19 patients and this difference tended to be statistically significant (p= 0.09).Conclusions:Delirium is quite common and requires aggressive treatment among COVID-19 patients, despite being younger than non-COVID-19 patients. Physicians should be vigilant to assess and manage delirium to improve the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients.ReferencesPisani MA et al.Arch Intern Med 2007;167:1629–1634.Kotfis K et al.

Using whole-cell patch clamp methods, we tested how neuronal function was impacted by 22–28-h exposure to NVC.Results:We found that NVC depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP), reduced the firing threshold of neocortical neurons, and increased baseline spontaneous action potential (AP) firing. NVC altered the sensitivity (or input–output properties) of single neurons to changes in their microenvironment. Specifically, decreasing external Ca2+and Mg2+from physiological to low (1.1–0.2 mM) levels increased evoked AP firing in control, but not following exposure to NVC. AP firing threshold and spontaneous firing rates returned to control levels 1 h after NVC wash-out. However, the RMP and attenuated sensitivity of evoked APs to changes in the microenvironment remained persistently abnormal suggesting two distinct mechanisms were at play. Interestingly, hyperpolarizing the RMP reversed this altered response.Conclusions:Sustained exposure to NVC reversibly depolarizes neocortical neuronal RMP, altering excitability and the ability of neurons to respond to microenvironment changes. By characterizing the pathogenesis of the underlying changes in neuronal function in our model of coronavirus encephalopathy we will identify intervenable drug targets.ReferencesUginet M et al.

We conducted a prospective study to study whether dendritic cells (DC) and its subtypes can predict persistent organ failure (POF) in patients with predicted SAP.

AP patients were divided into TOF and POF groups, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. The changes of DC, mDC and pDC in peripheral blood of patients with AP: compared with the control group, the peripheral blood DC and mDC of the AP group decreased significantly (p= 0.000). DC and mDC in peripheral blood of patients with AP were negatively correlated with the severity of the disease (APACHE, II, Ranson scores and revised Marshall scores) (p< 0.05). DC prediction in patients with early AP prediction of POF AUC 0.808 (0.667–0.949).Conclusions:The percentages of DC, mDC and pDC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AP are significantly lower. The expression of DC, mDC and pDC in peripheral blood monocytes correlated with the severity of the disease. The quantity of DC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AP may be a good index to predict the occurrence of POF.P116Real-time, leukocyte-related, four times validated, patient data partitioningA Rivas1, C Libertin2, P Satashia3, S Isha3, A Jenkins3, A Hanson3, D Sanghavi3, P Moreno Franco31Center for Global Health, School of Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA,2Mayo Clinic, Infectious"

Analyzing the same primary data, it was asked whether information contents differed among methods and/or when two sets of structured indicators are used.Results:While unstructured data did not distinguish survivors from non-survivors (Fig. 1, rectangle A), one data structure (here identified with letters expressed in italics) exhibited one perpendicular inflection that differentiated two patient groups (B). Two survivor-related observations were also distinguished from the remaining data points (B).

In patients taking steroids, identification of sepsis may be difficult due to the numerous effects of steroids on the immune system. The IntelliSep test is an investigational diagnostic that quantifies immune activation by measuring the biophysical properties of leukocytes from a blood sample in < 10 min. The test provides a single score, the IntelliSep Index (ISI), between 0.1 and 10.0, stratified into three interpretation bands of increasing disease severity risk: green, yellow, and red. Previously, we demonstrated the utility of the test on risk-stratifying patients with suspicion of sepsis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the performance of the ISI on a subpopulation of patients taking steroids.Methods:Adult patients presenting to the ED with signs or suspicion of infection were prospectively enrolled at multiple US sites (Feb. 2016–Oct. 2021). EDTA-anticoagulated blood was assayed and patients were followed by retrospective chart review for outcome information.

Current meta-analysis revealed a few models with good accuracy using more than 10 predictors [1]. We propose an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the risk of sepsis a few hours in advance for the use in intensive care units (ICU).Methods:Data were collected from an ICU of a tertiary care university centre. Septic patients and controls over 18 years old were included. To build a prognostic model only patients were selected with data being available at least 24 h before the onset of sepsis. Controls were matched accordingly. The vital signs were continuously monitored using high frequency automated measurements. At each timepoint of the measurement the median of the values from the last two hours was calculated to smoothen the measurement curves and account for single missing values. We used several clinically relevant vital signs combinations with less than 10 variables to select predictors for the ideal model. The area under curve (AUC), the accuracy and the precision were calculated for each model to evaluate the prediction performance.Results:We identified about 5000 patients from the database matching the inclusion criteria. Of these 1.5% had sepsis identified by the qSOFA criteria. The best time point to predict sepsis was ten hours before the onset of sepsis. An ANN achieved a high prediction accuracy of over 80% ROC AUC beside lower performing models like logistic regression.Conclusions:We identified a model capable to predict the risk of sepsis hours ahead before onset.

CRP is an inflammatory marker that can be used to individually tailor steroid use in patients with CAP.Methods:Using a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with CAP from 2009 to 2020, we conducted a target trial emulation comparing CRP-guided corticosteroid use to usual care. CRP-guided corticosteroid use arm specified measurement of CRP within 48 h of CAP admission and administration of corticosteroids for those with CRP ≥ 150 mg/dl but not those with CRP < 150 mg/dl. Remaining patients were classified as ‘usual care’. In eligible patients, inverse probability of treatment weighting methodology was used to balance potential confounders between CRP-guided and the usual care cohorts. The primary outcome was worst clinical status using the adapted WHO clinical progression scale. Secondary outcomes included need for non-invasive and invasive ventilation, and mortality. Weighted proportional odds logistic regression and logistic regression compared outcomes, using generalized estimating equations for robust variance estimates. Estimates reflect a per-protocol analysis of the specified target trial.Results:In total, 184 patient received CRP-guided corticosteroid treatment and 4369 received usual care. Median age was 74, and the sample was 54% male and 94% white race. There was no difference in the primary outcome between the CRP-guided and usual-care groups. Specifically, in the unweighted analysis: OR 0.74 (95% CI 0.52–1.05;p= 0.093) and weighted analysis (OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.57–1.24,p= 0.38).

However, technologies such as single‐cell RNA‐sequencing and cytometry by time‐of‐flight are not readily accessible in low resources settings. More recently developed epigenetic quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods enable immune cell characterization and counting by evaluating cell type-specific unmethylated DNA. This approach is suited for low-resource settings and low- and middle-income countries.Methods:We conducted comprehensive epigenetic cellular immunophenotyping of innate and adaptive immune cells in sepsis patients enrolled in an observational study in Ghana. Fourteen epigenetic assays were used to analyze whole blood of 103 subjects upon admission to the emergency department with up to 5 serial samples (0, 1, 3 and 28 days, 6 and 12 months).Results:Comparison between sepsis patients and healthy donors showed significant differences at enrolment, including decreased proportions of natural killer (NK) cells, and helper CD4 + and cytotoxic CD8 + T-cells, whereas neutrophil levels were elevated. Inspection of the data by mortality showed significantly decreased levels of T cells and CTLA4 + cells in the early non-survivor group (died within 28 days), but otherwise their immune cell profiles were comparable to the late non-survivor or survivor groups. Recovery from neutrophilia and lymphopenia initiated within 72 h in the sepsis survivors, but not in the early or late non-survivor groups. Finally, some cell types took up to a year to re-equilibrate back to normal levels, whereas others recover more quickly.Conclusions:Taken together these results show that epigenetic immune cell profiling is a promising new tool for diagnostic and prognostic profiling of sepsis subjects in low resource settings. Future analysis will use these data and available medical data to identify clinically relevant endotypes.P123The role of IRS-1 gene polymorphism G972 to the increase of IGFBP-1"

The pathogenesis of both hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have not been clearly understood up till now. The advancement of molecular biology made the expert start investigating the possibility of sepsis pathogenesis that also come from genetic concept likes polymorphism [1].Methods:This was a cohort molecular epidemiology study to investigate the role of polymorphism G972A gene IRS-1 to increase of IGFBP-1 concentration (as a marker of insulin resistance), and mortality risk in hyperglycemia severe sepsis patients. We divided into two groups, IGFBP-1 group and IRS-1 group. The differences of two varibles were analyzed by X2and mortality risk was measured with relative risk. Significance of differences was determined byp< 0.05.Results:In IGFBP-1 group that consist of 40 patients, the role of polymorphism to increase of IGFBP-1 concentration was analyzed, and in IRS-1 group that consist of 70 patients, the role of polymorphism to mortality was analyzed. In IGFBP-1 group, the role of IRS-1 gene polimorhism G972A to increase IGFBP-1 concentration was 27% (RR: 0.73; 95 CI: 0.1–4), and it was also found that mortality risk in polymorhism patients was 1.6 higher than in patients without polymorphism (RR: 1.6; 95% CI 1–4).Conclusions:In this study, we found that in hyperglycemia severe sepsis patients, IRS-1 gene polymorphism G972A had a slight role to increase IGFBP-1 concentration, and it is also act as mortality risk factor.

Coding potential of circRNAs was assessed by bioinformation analysis. Human monocytes (THP-1) and mice cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model were used to evaluate the function of micropeptide encoded by circRNAs.Results:We identified a novel circRNA-encoded micropeptide named “Motor” for the first time in sepsis. Motor was found lowly expressed in septic shock patients and lower Motor level correlated with poor prognosis, indicating that Motor plays a protective role in sepsis. Silencing Motor by siRNA dramatically suppressed chemokines and cytokines production globally in human monocyte THP1 cells upon LPS stimulation. Consistently, overexpression of Motor promoted pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing. Mechanically, transcriptome profiling indicated that Motor regulated NF-κB signaling. In an experimental model, exosome-based delivery of Motor enhanced the pro-inflammatory function of monocyte and relieved sepsis-associated organ damage and mortality.Conclusions:Our results highlight the pro-inflammatory function of Motor in converting LPS tolerance of monocytes and the clinical potential of targeting Motor for monocyte-cell-directed immunotherapy in sepsis.P125Health economic impact of the use of calprotectin immunoassay for early detection of infections in intensive care patientsA Havelka1, M Lipcsey2, M Hultström2, A Larsson31Gentian Diagnostics, Stockholm, Sweden,2Uppsala University, Department of Surgical Sciences, Anesthesiology, Uppsala, Sweden,3Akademiska University Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Chemistry, Uppsala, SwedenCritical Care2023,27(S1): P125Introduction:Early diagnosis of bacterial infections in critically ill patients is challenging, as the clinical manifestation is non-specific. Neutrophil activation is a major response to bacterial infection and calprotectin is an important marker for neutrophil mediated inflammation. Earlier studies have shown the ability of calprotectin to predict bacterial infections before onset of clinical symptoms. With early diagnosis of bacterial infections delayed treatment will be avoided as well as deterioration due to severe infections/sepsis.Methods:A decision tree model is employed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of calprotectin analysis for early detection of bacterial infection and thus, the earlier start of antibiotic treatment compared to other diagnostic biomarkers. The comparators included in the analysis are white blood cell count, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and no testing. The analysis is based on patients admitted to an ICU in a Swedish hospital.

Acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause a systemic disease range unpredictably from mild flu-like disease to multiple organ failure. Despite many studies and scientific interest for COVID 19, there is lack of information regarding correlation between serum CST levels and clinical course od COVID 19. There are only few studies investigated CST plasma levels at COVID 19 patients, but mostly at ICU-patients, and those studies revealed that COVID 19 patients release significant amounts of CST in the plasma and CST predicts a poor COVID-19 outcome.

Urosepsis is beside pneumonia one of the most common reasons for ICU administration in elderly patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a promising biomarker to help diagnose sepsis and guide treatment decisions. We aimed to assess the utility of highly elevated PCT concentrations in serum to predict urosepsis in critically ill patients.Methods:We compared in a monocentric, retrospective study septic patients with PCT values > 50 ng/ml to patients with PCT < 15 ng/ml in terms of primary focus of infection. Kruskal–Wallis test was performed to show differences in PCT-values between different foci of infection in both groups. Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) was used to find cut-off-values to distinguish between foci of infection.Results:88 out of 255 included patients had a maximum PCT > 50 ng/ml within the first 48 h of ICU admission. Median age was 66 (60–76) years, 63.6% were male and median SOFA-Score was 12 (10–15). Patients with PCT > 50 ng/ml showed significantly more positive urine culture results compared to patients with PCT < 15 ng/ml (p< 0.001). In patients with PCT > 50 ng/ml, there was a significant difference in PCT values between patients with respiratory and genitourinary focus of infection (p= 0.019). Using CHAID, a genitourinary focus was only present in 12,7% of cases when PCT was < 180.5 ng/ml but in 47.1% when it was > 180.5 ng/ml (p= 0.011).Conclusions:When reaching high values, PCT can help to differentiate genitourinary focus of infection in critically ill patients at admission to ICU, using a cut-off-value of 180.5 ng/ml. This may help timely administration of specific urological treatment and result in further decline of mortality rates in urosepsis.P130Procalcitonin combined to point of care molecular respiratory panel testing for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency room: the PROARRAY studyL Velly1, M Cancella de Abreu2, D Boutolleau3, I Cherubini2, E Houas2, P"

We hypothesized that combining real-time PCT measurement and virus identification would reduce ATB exposition in LRTI suspicions presenting to the emergency department (ED).Methods:PROARRAY study is a prospective, randomized interventional trial, conducted in the adult ED of an academic 1600-bed hospital. Patients attending the ED with a suspicion of LRTI were randomized into the intervention arm (systematic PCT measurement and point of care BIOFIRE® RP2plus(then 2.1) testing, with the recommendation to withhold or withdraw ATB if PCT < 0.25 µg/L and/or identification of a virus) or a standard of care (SOC) arm. The primary endpoint was the duration of antibiotic exposure in the first 28 days.Results:451 patients were randomized (intervention: 225, SOC: 226), mean age 62.5 ± 19.4 years, hospitalization rate 59.9%, mean length of stay 7.4 ± 8.4 days. Main diagnoses were CAP (n = 129), COVID-19 (n = 91), AECOPD (n = 31). The BIOFIRE® RP2.1plusidentified at least one viral species in 112 patients (49.8%). The duration of ATB exposition in ITT population was 6.00 [0.00;9.00] and 5.00 [0.00–9.00] days in the SOC and interventional arm respectively (p= 0.71). ATB was started in 31.3% and 34.1% respectively (p= 0.54). ATB exposure was below 6 days in 100 (47.2%) and 108 patients (50.59%) respectively (p= 0.58).Conclusions:Displaying real-time PCT and RP results failed to significantly reduce the ATB exposition in LRTI suspicions. However, the ATB duration and rate of initiation were already low in SOC arm, which comprised PCT measurement in routine in our ED. Routine PCT measurement probably participated to the lower median ATB duration (6.0 days) than hypothesized (9.0 days) and argues for the main contribution of PCT in ATB stewardship. Moreover, as the intervention was done at ED’s level, we did not control for ATB stewardship in wards for inpatients.P131Temporal analysis of biomarker, severity-of-illness score, and machine learning model performance for sepsis predictionM Patton1, VX Liu2, M Might11University of Alabama at Birmingham, Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute, Birmingham, USA,2Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Oakland, USACritical Care2023,27(S1): P131Introduction:Adoption of electronic medical records has accelerated development of machine learning (ML) surveillance systems for predicting sepsis.

Studies were manually curated and selected based on a search criterion for a sepsis, bacteremia, or septic-shock outcome model with a performance evaluation using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) or precision recall curve (AUPRC). We categorized models as biomarker, severity score, and/or ML algorithm.Results:We identified 3393 sepsis prediction publications and selected 74 for further evaluation. The top performing biomarker and severity score-based models for sepsis detection were procalcitonin (AUROC range = 0.67–0.91) and the SIRS score (AUROC range = 0.65–0.81) for studies including > 1000 patient records. ML model performance for sepsis prediction as binary outcome exhibited a wide range in performance (AUROC range = 0.63–0.93). Newer approaches to assessing sepsis as a time-to-onset prediction had AUROCs ranging from 0.74 to 0.91, with neural networks exhibiting a higher performance range (AUROC = 0.64–0.91) compared to traditional regression methods (AUROC = 0.74–0.85) (Fig. 1). Studies incorporating novel data elements like clinical documentation often exhibit improved model performance. Inter-study comparison revealed a tremendously wide range in sepsis outcome rates from < 1% to as high as 50% across datasets and different definitions of sepsis, thereby underscoring the challenge of comparing performance across time and methods.Conclusions:A review of sepsis prediction models published over 3 decades revealed a wide variability in model performance and identified numerous confounding differences between studies limiting robust comparison.Fig. 1 (abstract P131).

Among them, five studies measuring the PSP by the ELISA technique explored the performance of PSP in stratifying unselected hospitalized adult patients on admission to the ICU/ED according to prognosis of mortality. We used hierarchical regression models to predict ICU mortality and evaluated predictive performance of PSP, PCT and CRP reporting classification plots besides AUC [1].Results:Among 678 patients included into the analysis, the estimated overall ICU mortality was 17.8% with a 95% prediction interval (PI) ranging from 4.1 to 54.6% with a substantial heterogeneity between studies (I-squared 87%). For the three studied biomarkers, sensitivity and 1-specifity with continuous risk thresholds are shown as classification plots (Fig. 1).

Sepsis-3 definition can be operationalized by clinicians by assessing a qSOFA ≥ 2 [1]. However, clinicians first need to identify patients with an infection, which can be challenging because of heterogenous clinical signs [2].Methods:Data was analyzed from clinical trials that enrolled ICU adult patients suspected of sepsis (n = 419) [3]. A full qSOFA calculated for 173 of these patients enabled stratification into < 2 or ≥ 2 groups. Expert panel diagnosis was performed retrospectively and independently classifying cases into systemic inflammation in response to infection (Inf+), or not (Inf-). SeptiCyte RAPID score (0–15) measured mRNA expression of two genes.Results:For 173 ICU patients suspected of sepsis, 71 (41%) were retrospectively diagnosed as Inf + and 102 (59%) were diagnosed as Inf- (Fig. 1).

Aim of our study is analyze the role of biomarkers in the prediction of specific organ dysfunction and mortality in septic CAP patients.Methods:We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective study held in the emergency department (ED) of five university hospitals in Italy [1]. Levels of CD64, PLA2GIIA, CD14 and CD25 were evaluated from samples collected within 12 h from ED arrival. Patients were followed until discharge for development of neurological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular and coagulation dysfunctions and in-hospital mortality was assessed.Results:Of 368 patients included in the analysis, 87 (24%) died during their hospital stay. All biomarkers showed correlation with mortality, but only CD14 and CD25 had significant increase in non-survivor at multivariate analysis corrected for age and comorbidities (452.5 [292 -754] vs 769 [453–1402]p< 0.01 and 13215 [9003–20041] vs 20329 [12841–36729]p< 0.01).

Fractal dimension (df), the biomarker of clot microstructure that measures thrombogenicity has shown to be elevated in acute inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and severe sepsis. The aim of the study was to analyse these biomarkers in COVID-19 infection and whether these biomarkers help to predict mortality.Methods:120 suspected COVID-19 patients were recruited from the Emergency Department of a tertiary teaching hospital. One patient was excluded because they were anticoagulated, blood samples were taken to perform fractal dimension (df) and sRAGE.Results:When compared to PCR -ve group, 95 patients in the PCR + ve group had significantly elevated sRAGE (p< 0.001), but not df(p= 0.43). When compared to those who survived, sRAGE was significantly elevated (p= 0.01) in 14 patients who died in PCR + ve group, but not df(p= 0.08). No significant correlation existed between sRAGE levels and dfin those patients who survived (p= 0.72) or died (p= 0.92). Logistic regression analysis showed that sRAGE and dfin combination acted as highly significant predictors of mortality in COVID-19 (p= 0.009) in PCR + ve group.Conclusions:COVID-19 patients had a profound inflammatory response as evidenced by significantly elevated sRAGE levels. This inflammatory process was more profound in those who died. The thrombogenicity in COVID-19 patients and those who died with COVID-19 appears to be not significant as measured by df. sRAGE in combination with dfcan be utilised as significant predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients.ReferenceButcher L et al.

Timely, accurate diagnosis of VAP and appropriate antibiotic therapy can impact outcomes. The disease itself is poorly defined and diagnosis often limited by low yield sampling techniques and delays in growth of microbiological samples. The use of rapid diagnostics such as BioFire VAP FilmArray have shown promise in reducing time to identification of pathogen, with hopes this may lead to more targeted antibiotic therapy. However, the benefit of this is unclear and relies on ICU clinicians having trust in the sampling technique and test itself. There Is a signficant cost burden to the test which on our unit was part of a routine order-set in patients suspected of VAP. We aimed to reduce uncessary sample through a QI process.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data from electronic health records of all patients admitted to our ICU between December 2021 to January 2022, and then a repeat analysis post intervention between December 2022. All patients ventilated greater than 48 h were included for analysis. Data on length of stay, mortality, duration of antibiotics, number of BioFire samples sent, and change to therapy post test were recorded.Results:BioFire lead to a change in therapy in 21% of patients. This was an escalation of antibiotics 66% of the time. The test never led to a cessation of antibiotic therapy. Following intervention (a package of education and removal of the test from our routine order set) there was an 90% reduction in unnecessary sampling. There was no significant change to duration of antibiotic, ICU length of stay or mortality in patients diagnosed as VAP following the change.Conclusions:The use of BioFire FilmArray tests rarely led to a clinical change on our unit. Removing the test from a routine order set did not seem to have a significant clinical impact.

The intervention was implemented in June 2021, totaling 728 patients before the intervention and 2543 patients after. The central venous catheter utilization rate, the incidence of primary bloodstream infections and the mortality rate standardized by the SAPS3 score were compared. The monthly incidence rate can be viewed on Fig. 1.Results:The incidence density of microbiologically proven primary bloodstream infections prior to the implementation of the audits was 0.79, with a central venous catheter utilization rate of 49.41%. The average achieved by the SAPS3 score of these patients was 56.63 points with a probability of death of 29.88%. The standardized in-hospital mortality rate (observed/expected) was 0.27. After the intervention, the incidence of laboratory-proven infections was 0.20, with a central venous catheter utilization rate of 33.80%. The mean by the SAPS3 score in the period was 50.62, with an in-hospital mortality rate (observed/expected) of 0.27.Conclusions:Although there was no reduction in the standardized mortality rate, the implementation of audits seems to be effective in reducing the prevalence of primary bloodstream infections.Fig. 1 (abstract P142).

Herein we present a complex PAM case that has been successfully treated.Methods:87 year old male was transferred to intensive care unit with an initial diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Medical history was normal except for a subdural hematoma operation 20 years ago. He was in Turkey for vacation. The patient was somnolent; had fever, altered sensorium and pneumonia. Leukocytosis and hyponatremia were present. Meropenem, vancomycin, clarithromycin and acyclovir treatments were started. Cultures and Herpes, Legionella, Listeria and tuberculosis tests were negative. The patient was orotracheal intubated due to generalized status epilepticus. Cranial imaging showed increased intracranial pressure, meningeal enhancement and subdural empyema in the right frontoparietal Burr-Hole region. He was operated. Incisions were made on the old scars and the Burr-Holes from previous surgery had been used. The CSF sample was colorless and had clean appearance. 20 leukocytes were counted and motile microorganisms with flagella were noticed during the count. A protozoa with vibratory movement was seen in the wet-mount preparation at 40× magnification (Fig. 1). Intravenous(IV) amphotericin-B, azithromycin, metronidazole and dexamethasone were administered. The patient, who was intubated for 11 days, was transferred from ICU on the 26th day healthily.Results:PAM is an acute disease of the central nervous system caused by N.fowleri.

Despite recent advances mortality is high, diagnosis remains a challenge and controversy exists regarding its treatment [1]. Our study describes the main characteristics of patients admitted with TEN/SJS.Methods:A retrospective descriptive study was developed in the Critical Burn Unit of Hospital La Paz between 2013 and 2021. The diagnosis of TEN/SJS was confirmed by biopsy. Medical care was provided by a multidisciplinary team and immunosuppressive drugs was decided on an individualized basis. Demographic data, SCORTEN, frequencies of ARDS, shock, AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), infections, immunosuppressive drugs used, doubts in the clinical diagnosis and mortality were collected.Results:28 patients were admitted; 13 TEN, 8 TEN-SJS overlap and 6 SJS. In 5 patients with TEN/SJS (confirmed by biopsy) there were diagnostic doubts at clinical evaluation, and 5 patients with clinical suspicion of TEN were eventually diagnosed with other serious skin conditions: graft-versus-host disease, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Among those with TEN we found: mean age 56 ± 17 years; 13 men; mean skin detachment area 33 ± 26% (5–90); SCORTEN 3; mortality 31%; 11 presented shock, 5 ARDS, 5 needed RRT and 14 had severe infections. Figure 1 shows immunosuppressive drugs.Conclusions:Data and mortality are consistent with literature and SCORTEN. Heterogeneity in immunosuppressive drugs used highlights the lack of consensus in treatment. Finally, similarities between the clinical presentation with other serious skin diseases highlight the difficulty in diagnosis and the possible delay in treatment. In any case, high-quality multidisciplinary supportive care is essential in all patients with severe skin diseases.

Recently, there was an update of European CLDI infection (CDI) treatment guidelines removing metronidazole from recommended regimen if vancomycin and fidaxomicin are available. Vancomycin is the most used agent against CDI and fidaxomicin is recommended only for treatment of initial CDI or the first recurrence. Several other agents with potential anti-CDI effect, such as tigecycline or rifampicin, are being considered and tested.Methods:We have chosen 60 isolates of CLDI obtained from stool samples of patients hospitalized in General University Hospital in Prague in years 2020–2021. All samples have been initially tested by quick immunochromatographic test for detection of antigen (GDH) and toxin A and/or B. When positive, culture on selective agar media was performed. Minimal inhibition concentration of vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline and rifampicin was then determined by gradient strip method (Etest®). There is no commercial method for testing susceptibility to fidaxomicin available.Results:Interpretation criteria (breakpoints) are provided only for vancomycin and metronidazole. All the strains tested were susceptible to both antibiotics, the range of MIC was 0.064–2 mg/l in vancomycin and 0.064–1 mg/l in metronidazole."

It is not possible to interpret the susceptibility of tigecycline and rifampicin, but the MICs suggested possibility of low efficiency, especially with the range of 0.016–32 mg/l in rifampicin. The MICs overall were the lowest in tigecycline, 0.016–1 mg/l.Conclusions:The established anti-CDI therapy regimen is appropriate, but it is important to investigate potential patterns of resistance. There are alternative antibiotic agents with activity against CLDI (the best results given by tigecycline), but further testing is crucial.P147Septic shock due toC. canimorsustreated with IgM-enriched immunoglobulin as adjuvant therapy in an immunocompetent womanJ Braunsteiner, S Siedler, D Jarczak, S Kluge, A NierhausUniversity Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Department of Intensive Care, Hamburg, GermanyCritical Care2023,27(S1): P147Introduction:Capnocytophaga canimorsusis a facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus and is part of the microflora of canine and feline oral cavities.C. canimorsuspossesses active and passive mechanisms of immune evasion. Invasive infections are rare and have been primarily described in immunocompromised patients.Methods:We report a case of a healthy, immunocompetent 51-year-old woman with purpura fulminans due to septic shock caused byC. canimorsusafter having been scratched by cats.Results:The patient was admitted to a community care hospital and treated with empirically targeted antibiotic therapy. 48 h after admission,C. canimorsuscould be identified as causative pathogen, and her antibiotic regimen was adapted. She was referred to our department because of multi-organ dysfunction and refractory shock. The blood gas analysis showed hyperlactatemia with 17 mmol/l. The inflammatory markers were increased (WBC 16.2 G/l, procalcitonin 49.6 µg/l, CRP 247 mg/l, IL-6 3321 ng/l). Further analysis revealed pathologically low IgM levels (0.31 g/l). Adjuvant therapy with IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin®) was initiated to restore normal values. The further course was complicated by acute respiratory failure, multiple regional infarctions, and recurrent septic episodes. IgM had decreased to 0.32 g/l on day 78, which was again treated with Pentaglobin®. After prolonged intensive care therapy, her condition improved, and she was transferred to a rehabilitation center.Conclusions:Data on immunoglobulin therapy in sepsis is conflicting and there is a lack of evidence in patients with invasiveC. canimorsusinfection. However, following the administration of immunoglobulins the patient showed sustained clinical improvement. Patients with both a high inflammatory load and IgM deficiency might benefit from therapeutic IgM-administration.Acknowledgement:We obtained informed consent from the patient to publish the clinical details.

Sepsis is usually caused by pet bites.Methods:Case report.Results:A 58-year-old male presented at our hospital with severe sepsis. Patient history did not present any potential diagnostical clues. The patient owned a dog, but denied being bitten. He did not use any immunosuppressive medication. No focus for an infection was found during physical examination. Imaging studies were non-conclusive. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with rapid progressive multi–organ failure and treated with mechanical ventilation, inotropes and broad–spectrum antibiotics. Initial blood and urine cultures remained negative. On day 8 of his ICU stay a 16S rRNA gene-sequencing test revealed an bacteremia withCapnocytophagus canimorsus, a slow–growing, gram–negative rod, present in dog or cat saliva and associated with pet bites [1]. Antibiotic treatment was adapted, and the patient made a quick recovery. Revision of the CT–images showed a small spleen (52.4 mm). Additional blood tests showed Howell-Jolly bodies, indicating functional asplenism.

ForEnterobacteraleswe also tested aztreonam/avibactam (AZA) for which there are no breakpoints yet. The highest MIC of AZA observed was 0.75 mg/l, in the susceptible cohort the range was 0.023–0.064 mg/l and in the DTR cohort (incl. class B beta-lactamase producers) it was 0.047–0.75 mg/l.

Such strains along with the burden of co-morbidities, especially in ICU patients, pose therapeutic challenges and contribute to high mortality rates. Combination of antimicrobial drugs is one of the few options available to overcome this challenge. Among others the combination of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) plus meropenem (MEM) has been proposed to be effective and safe [1].Methods:A prospective single cohort study was conducted from March to August 2022. Among 50 patients admitted to our General ICU, 8 patients were diagnosed with VAP due to PDR-Kp. After clinical suspicion, VAP diagnosis was performed from microbiological and clinical tools, namely positive tracheal aspirate cultures (≥ 105cfu/ml) and CPIS score ≥ 6. Kp was considered PDR if microbiological tests revealed resistance to cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, quinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, aminoglycosides, colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin and ceftazidime/avibactam. If patients were haemodynamic stable, with no need of vasopressors, combination therapy CZA-MEM was introduced. Primary outcome was the resolution of pneumonia and secondary outcome was 30-day mortality.Results:Table 1 tabulates clinical characteristics of the population enrolled.

Patients were randomised to MIPD with dose and interval adjustments based on monitoring serum drug levels (therapeutic drug monitoring) combined with pharmacometric modelling of beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin (Fig. 1). The primary outcome was ICU length of stay (LOS).

Optimal dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics in septic patients remains challenging [1]. Time above minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the determinant of beta-lactam antibiotic efficacy. Plasma concentration from 1 to 4 × MIC for 100% of the dosing interval has been suggested as target level. Repeated measurement of plasma concentrations are proposed to avoid insufficient concentrations of beta-lactams in critically ill patients. The aim was to describe plasma concentration achievement of beta-lactams in septic patients during the first 48 h after admittance to the ICU.Methods:A prospective, observational study included adults with community-acquired sepsis admitted from the emergency department to the ICU. Antibiotic plasma concentration measurements during administration of piperacillin-tazobactam [PTZ, 4 g× 3–4], cefotaxime [CTX, 2 g× 3] and benzyl-penicillin [PEN, 3 g× 3]) were collected at 2–7 occasions/patient and analysed using liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry. To evaluate time above MIC, theoretical MICs representing the EUCAST I breakpoints were used for bacteria common in community acquired pathogens.Results:Out of the thirty-two patients included, 56% were men (18/32), with median age of 71 (min–max 28–85) and with median SOFA score of 7 (min–max 3–13). They were either treated with PTZ (n = 23), PEN (n = 4) or CTX (n = 11). Seven patients had an altered antibiotic regimen during the 48 h, resulting in a total of 169 plasma concentration measurements. The percentage of plasma concentrations above MIC × 1/ × 4 during the 48 h was 97/89% for PTZ (n = 113), 91/73% for PEN (n = 11) and 98/76% for CTX (n = 45) (Fig. 1).Conclusions:In septic patients receiving standard dosing of CTX, PTZ or PEN, plasma concentrations had a large variation but most were above effective concentrations.ReferencePetersson J"

The recommended pharmacodynamic target for beta-lactam antibiotics is 100% of the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration [1]. Antibiotic dose optimization can be performed with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). In this study we therefore developed prediction models for TNA in ICU patients receiving beta-lactams.Methods:Data of the Dolphin and Expat studies were used to train and internally validate three machine learning models to predict TNA on the day after antibiotic initiation [2]. After excluding patients on dialysis, 378 patients remained. For covariate selection, the Boruta algorithm was used in the training set and afterwards manually verified by adding and removing covariates. A random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR) and naïve bayes (NB) model were developed and externally validated with data from UZ Leuven and Amsterdam UMC (150 patients). Model performance was evaluated using a 1000-times cross-validation. The main performance metric used was the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC).Results:The covariates age, sex, serum creatinine and type of antibiotic were found to be TNA predictors. In the internal validation, the NB, LR and RF models showed an AUROC of 0.82 [0.74, 0.91], 0.81 [0.76, 0.91] and 0.81 [0.75, 0.91], respectively. In the external validation, the models showed an AUROC of 0.75 [0.67, 0.82], 0.80 [0.73, 0.87] and 0.79 [0.72, 0.86], respectively (Fig. 1 including other metrics).Conclusions:All models showed good performance in both validation sets using four readily available covariates.

The trearment guidelines recommend an individualized target of AUC/MIC 400–600, assuming MIC 1 mg/l. However, most programs performing Bayesian estimation require only one vancomycin level. Currently no data suggest how many vancomycin levels should be collected for the correct estimation AUC/MIC in critically ill patients.Methods:In this prospective study performed in the ICU of Clinica Alemana de Santiago, patients receiving vancomycin as part their care was enrrolled. Vancomycin levels were taken at the end-infusion (peak), 120 min following the end-infusion (beta) and immediately before the next dose (trough). The AUCREFwas calculated by linear-long trapezoidal rule using all vancomycin levels taken. The Bayesian software used was PrecisePK™, PreciseRX, San Diego, USA. Five different AUCs were obtained by PrecisePK™ as follow: 1.- peak, beta and trough; 2.- beta and trough; 3.- peak and trough; 4.- trough; 5.- AUC obtained PrecisePK™ without vancomycin level. Accuracy was defined as the median ratio of the estimated AUC to AUCREF. Bias was defined as the median of the absolute value of the percentage difference of the estimated AUC from AUCREF. Then each AUC obtained by PrecisePK™ was comapred with AUCREFusing Mann–WhitneyUTest.pvalue was fixed at < 0.05.Results:Thirty-six patients were inclued. In general, no significant differences were observed between five ways to approach estimated AUC. However, the most accurate and the least biased estimated AUC was using peak and trough.Conclusions:The findings of this study showed that the critically ill patients Bayesian dose-optimizing program using peak and trough produce estimated AUC more accurate and with less bias. These results give an empirical basis to support the recommendations of current clinical guidelines.P157Aminoglycoside dosing in intensive care: are we getting it right?F"

Adverse effects are often associated with sustained trough concentrations and include neuromuscular weakness, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, with some studies reporting the latter in > 58% of all ICU patients receiving AMGs [1]. Therefore, we investigated the AMG prescribing practices in the ICU of a large tertiary centre in the UK.Methods:All ICU patients prescribed AMGs were identified from March 2021 to March 2022, excluding indications for infective endocarditis and medical or surgical prophylaxis. A retrospective review of patients’ clinical notes alongside the hospital’s AMG guideline was performed to assess prescribing and protocol compliance as a registered service evaluation.Results:228 patients were identified with 136 receiving gentamicin (60%) and 92 receiving amikacin (40%). 159 patients received a single dose, where 94 (59%) of these did not have a subsequent trough level taken in case of requirement for further doses. 69 patients (30%) received multiple doses. Prescription errors were identified in 28 of these (41%). Errors included subsequent doses being given too early (< 24 h) in 43% (12/28), without a confirmed trough level in 21% (6/28) or a combination of both in 21% (6/28). Moreover, 14% of these patients (4/28) received a subsequent dose despite a high trough level.Conclusions:There was a risk of significant harm for a small number of patients receiving multiple doses. ICU-specific AMG guidelines need to be developed in line with current evidence and a safety alert will be added onto the prescribing system. Re-audit following these interventions is planned alongside engagement of ICUs from other centres to promote collaborative learning and service improvement.ReferenceOliveira JF et al.

According to the institutional protocol at the ICU of the Ghent University Hospital, TDM of LZD is recommended in patients with augmented renal clearance, renal/hepatic impairment, low baseline platelet count, sepsis/septic shock and/or expected treatment duration > 14 days [1]. Decision to monitor is at the discretion of the treating physician. Target attainment, defined as a trough concentration between 2 and 7 mg/L, was the primary endpoint and TDM-guided dose adjustments were descriptively analysed.Results:Of the 47 patients treated with LZD during the study period, TDM was performed in 14 patients (29.8%), all meeting the criteria. Noteworthy, 90.9% of the patients without monitoring were eligible for TDM as well. Intra-abdominal infections were the most common infection (42.6%). Median treatment duration of LZD in ICU was 5.7 [3.7–8.5] days for all patients. Therapeutic range was reached at first measurement in 9 of 14 (65.0%) patients. After TDM-guided dose adjustments, a total of 11/14 (78.6%) patients were within therapeutic range after a median of 2.6 [2.5–4.5] days.Conclusions:Two thirds of the TDM patients reached therapeutic concentrations at first measurement and an extra 13.6% patients after dose adjustment.

Critically unwell patients are at increased risk of developing invasive fungal infections [1]. The aim of this study was to identify the number of patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 who developed fungal infections and to compare these patients (fungal group) with those without fungal infections (non-fungal group) to investigate which factors may have contributed to increased risk of infection.Methods:Retrospective study undertaken in a tertiary teaching hospital ICU. 174 patients admitted with severe COVID-19 infection during March 2020 until May 2021 were included.Results:81(47%) patients developed fungal infections of which 94% had Candida and 6% had Aspergillus infection. Age and smoking history did not appear to be a contributing factor. The non-fungal group had significantly higher body mass index (33 ± 8 vs 31 ± 7,p= 0.01). ICU length of stay [23(1–116) vs 8(1–60),p< 0.001], hospital length of stay [30(3–183) vs 15(1–174) ± 7,p< 0.001], steroid days [10(1–116) vs 4(0–28),p= 0.02] and ventilation days [18(0–120) vs 2(0–55),p< 0.001] were significantly higher in the fungal group. The mortality rate in both groups were similar (51% vs 51.6%).Conclusions:Fungal infections are extremely common in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, seen in almost half of patients in this cohort (47%). Longer treatment with corticosteroids appears to increase the risk of developing fungal infections. Increased length of ICU stay, and a greater length of mechanical ventilation significantly increase the risk of fungal infections in COVID-19 patients in intensive care."

This post-hoc, integrated analysis of STRIVE (Phase 2;NCT02734862) and ReSTORE (Phase 3;NCT03667690) investigated the efficacy and safety of rezafungin (RZF), a novel, once-weekly (QW) echinocandin, in a subgroup of patients with C and/or IC in the ICU.Methods:Patients received RZF QW (400 mg in Week 1, then 200 mg) or caspofungin (CAS) once daily (70 mg on Day [D] 1, then 50 mg with optional oral fluconazole stepdown) for 2‒4 weeks. The primary endpoint (U.S. FDA) was all-cause mortality (ACM) at D30. Other endpoints included mycological eradication at D5 and D14 (secondary) and time to negative blood culture (TTNBC; exploratory). Safety was evaluated by adverse events (AEs).Results:Baseline patient characteristics were generally similar between the RZF (n = 55) and CAS (n = 71) arms; 32.1% (17) and 29.6% (21) of patients receiving RZF and CAS, respectively had an acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation II score ≥ 20.

The aim of the present study is to asses the impact on renal function of L-AmB during the first days of ICU admission in critically ill patients.Methods:Retrospective, single-center case series of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted in ICU. Setting: 19-bed medical-surgical ICU of a community hospital. Time of study: 2 years. Study variables: APACHE II and SOFA at admission,clinical characteristics, oliguria and creatinine level at admission and 72 h after L-AmB treatment were recorded. Oliguria was defined as urinary output less than 400 ml per day or less than 20 ml per hour. Two groups of patients were selected according to whether or not they received anticipated antifungal treatment pending microbiologic confirmation or discarding of aspergillosis; dosage of L-AmB was 3 mg/kg/d. Statistical analysis: Data were analyzed by SPSS 18 and quantitative variables were expressed as a mean ± standard deviation.Results:160 patients were included, 102 who received 3 days of anticipated treatment with L-AmB at ICU admission or at the beginning of mechanical ventilation were compared with patients without this treatment.

The goal of this study was to explore the variables that may influence SV and CO improvement and mortality in shock patients when monitored during usual care resuscitation.Methods:The Starling Registry trends CO and SV over time as related to patient outcome (NCT04648293). Patients were managed at a single community academic medical ICU using dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness through passive leg raise (PLR) to guide the administration of fluid and VP. Patients exhibiting overall improvement in SV and CO (Responders) from initial presentation through hours of monitoring were compared to those who did not improve (Non-Responders).Results:31 patients received hemodynamic monitoring during their ICU stay. 45% were female; average age was 58 years. 26% of patients had sepsis; 35% had known LV/RV dysfunction. 16 patients (52%) were classified as responders and received a total fluid volume of 500 ml (± 273.86). 15 patients (48%) were non-responders and received 1232 ml of fluid (± 635.37), (Δ732 ml,p= 0.040).

Some authors emphasized,in randomized controlled trials, the importance of early administration of IVIG in patients with septic shock.So, the objective of our study was to test, in these patients, the impact of timing of IVIG administration( early versus late) on the outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality.Methods:In this retrospective observational study,we collected and analyzed between 2018 and 2021,the data of 2 groups of 20 patients in septic shock according to definition of Sepsis 3 criteria,admitted in university hospital ICU..The patients were 62 + -10 years old, mechanically ventilated, with the same baseline charasteristics and severity scores on admission.All the patients received empirical antibiotics and norepinephrine in the first hour of admission in ICU.The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of IVIG administration: the first group receiving IVIG early on the first hour of admission (Early IVIG group) and the second group receiving IVIG 48 h after admission on ICU(Late IVIG group). IVIG was infused continuously at a dose of 0.5 g/kg with a flow of 3 ml/kg/h during 3 days in the 2 groups. We recorded in the 2 groups: SOFA score day 1 and day 4, blood lactate every day, C-reactive protein (CRP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), P/F ratio day 1 and day 3, time on vaspressors, time on mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, hospital length of stay (LOS) and 28 day mortality.Results:Statistic analysis used Mann Whitney test and results expressed as"

The intravenous immunoglobulins are involved in pathogen/toxin scavenging and inhibition of inflammatory mediators gene transcription with anti-apoptotic effects on immune system cells. This research aimed to describe the effects of intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins in COVID-19 patients with sepsis due to secondary infections and low IgM levels.Methods:We performed an observational retrospective study, including patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) between March 2020 and February 2021 with severe COVID-19 and sepsis due to a superinfection (known or suspected) treated with intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins. We collected demographic data and comorbidities. We noted hemodinamic data, antimicrobial and adiuvant therapies, laboratory results at ICU admission (T0), at the beginning (T1) and at the end (T2) of the IgM-enriched immunoglobulins infusion and at ICU discharge (T3).Results:In our cohort of 36 patients (Table 1) the prevalence of documented secondary infections was 83%. We observed a significant reduction of leukocytes from T0 to T3 (10.4 [8.3–14.5] × 103/mmc vs 7.1 [4.8–11.2] × 103/mmc,p< 0.01) and the SOFA score from T0 to T2 (7 [6–19] vs 5 [3–7],p< 0.01) and from T0 to T3 (7 [6–10] vs 4 [2–9],p< 0.01); from T1 to T2 (7 [6–9] vs 5 [3–7],p< 0.01) and from T1 to T3 (7 [6–9] vs 4 [2–9],p< 0.01). Cardiovascular SOFA showed a statistically significant reduction from T1 to T2 (4 [3–4] vs 0 [0–3],p< 0.01).Conclusions:The IgM-enriched immunoglobulins could improve organ function, as evidenced by the reduction of the SOFA score.

We explored whether continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using adsorption membrane (oXiris®) could reduce the inflammatory response in critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute renal failure (ARF) [1, 2].Methods:Case–control study including 24 critically ill COVID-2019 patients requiring RRT using an oXiris filter. We measured cytokines before and during treatment as well as relevant clinical endpoints. The control group was selected among COVID-19 patients included into our ongoing RECORDS trial (NCT04280497) who received RRT without adsorbing filters.Results:24 severe COVID-19 patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated with CRRT using the oXiris filter between March and April 2020 (20 males and 4 females); median age 67. The average time from COVID-19 symptoms to initiation of oXiris treatment was 18 ± 7 days, and from ICU admission to initiation of oXiris treatment 9.5 ± 7.8 days and from ARF to oXiris treatment was 3 ± 5 days. The average length of treatment was 152.8 ± 92.3 h. Treatment was associated with cytokine decreases for IL-1beta (p= 0.00022), MCP-1 (p= 0.03), and MIP-1 alpha (p= 0.03). The SOFA scores also showed a reduction over 48 h of therapy without reaching statistical significance. Our study found no significant effect of hemodynamic status. The average ICU stay length was 14 ± 5 days and the mortality rate was 79% in the Oxiris group. We compared the mortality across the two matched groups, there was no evidence of any difference in mortality (Fig. 1).Conclusions:In our study, CRRT using the oXiris filter seemed to effectively remove IL-1 beta, MCP-1, and MIP-1 alpha in COVID-19 patients. These exploratory results should be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.ReferencesBroman ME et al. PLoS One 2019;14:e0220444.Stockmann H et al.

A novel method is represented by the MediSieve Magnetic Haemofiltration System (MMHS), which aims to selectively remove interleukin (IL)-6 from the bloodstream by infusing magnetic beads coupled to anti-IL-6 antibodies into an extracorporeal circulation system containing a filter placed inside a magnet (Fig. 1A). We assessed the efficacy of MMHS to remove IL-6 in a benchtop experiment and its safety in humans.Methods:Four human plasma samples were spiked with a mixture of several cytokines and passed through the MMHS at a flow rate of 120 ml/min. Magnetic beads coupled with anti-IL-6 antibodies were infused into the system and cytokine concentrations were determined at several timepoints. Safety was evaluated by performing haemoperfusion using the MMHS in six healthy male and female volunteers (both n = 3) for five hours with a flow rate of 120 mL/min. Vital signs were monitored continuously and blood samples were serially obtained.Results:The MMHS rapidly and selectively removed IL-6 from human plasma, without affecting concentrations of other cytokines (Fig. 1B). No serious adverse events occurred during haemoperfusion in healthy volunteers, who did not experience any symptoms either. Several mild adverse events were observed, including a small haematoma around the canulation site and transient, clinically irrelevant increases in iron, chromium and manganese. Haemofiltration using the MMHS did not cause relevant changes in vital signs (Fig. 1C, D), thrombocytes, leukocytes (Fig. 1E, F), or increases in plasma cytokine concentrations.Conclusions:The MMHS selectively removes IL-6 from human plasma and is well-tolerated and safe in healthy volunteers. In future studies, we will use the experimental endotoxemia model to assess the efficacy of the MMHS in removing IL-6 from the circulation in humans in vivo.Fig. 1 (abstract P172).APrinciple of the MediSieve Magnetic Haemofiltration System (MMHS).

We investigated the effects of CytoSorb hemoperfusion on plasma levels of various cytokines using the repeated human experimental endotoxemia model, a highly standardized and reproducible human in vivo model of systemic inflammation and immunological tolerance induced by administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Methods:Twenty-four healthy male volunteers (age 18–35) were intravenously challenged with LPS (a bolus of 1 ng/kg followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 ng/kg/hr for three hours) twice: on day 0 to quantify the initial cytokine response and on day 7 to quantify the degree of endotoxin tolerance. Subjects were randomized to receive either CytoSorb hemoperfusion for 6 h during the first LPS challenge (CytoSorb group), or no intervention (control group). Blood samples were serially obtained to determine cytokine plasma concentrations and clearance rates.Results:LPS administration led to a profound increase in cytokine plasma concentrations during both LPS challenge days (Fig. 1). Compared to the control group, significantly lower plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF, −58%,p< 0.0001), interleukin (IL)-6 (−71%,p= 0.003), IL-8 (−48%,p= 0.02) and IL-10 (−26%,p= 0.03) were observed in the CytoSorb group during the first LPS challenge. Peak clearance rates ranged from a median of 75.1 [70.7–87.1] ml/min for TNF, to 32.5 [28.0–44.2] ml/min for IL-6. The degree of endotoxin tolerance apparent during the second LPS challenge was not affected by previous CytoSorb use.Conclusions:CytoSorb hemoperfusion effectively attenuates circulating cytokine concentrations during systemic inflammation in humans in vivo, whereas it does not affect tolerance induction. Therefore, CytoSorb therapy may be of benefit in conditions characterized by excessive cytokine release.Fig. 1 (abstract P173).

Those requiring ECMO or renal replacement therapy were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive standard-of-care (SOC) or SOC plus HA. HA was performed as standalone therapy for 24 h, using CytoSorb® and regional heparin-protamine anticoagulation. We collected feasibility, safety, clinical data and serial plasma cytokines levels over 72 h of randomization.Results:We enrolled 21 patients, 16 (76%) had out-of-hospital CA and median (IQR) time-to-ROSC was 30 (20, 45) minutes. Eleven received SOC and 10 HA, which was initiated in all 10 patients within 18 (11, 23) hours after ICU admission, and for a duration of 21 (14, 24) hours. The intervention was well tolerated except for a trend for higher rate of aPTT elevation (5 (50%) vs 2 (18%)p= 0.18) and mild (< 150 g/l) thrombocytopenia (5 (50%) vs 2 (18%)p= 0.18). Interleukin (IL)-6 plasma levels at randomization were low (< 100 pg/ml) in 10 (48%) patients and elevated (> 1000 pg/ml) in 6 (29%). Median relative reduction of IL-6 at 48 h was 75% (60, 94) in the HA group versus 5% (-47, 70) in the SOC group (p= 0.06).

The clinical experience is widely documented in adults, whereas experience in paediatric settings is currently limited to single case reports or monocentric retrospective studies. In order to be able to collect evidences in larger paediatric population, an Italian multicentre network was founded (CYTOPED Study Group).Methods:Italian multicentric observational study on the use of CytoSorb® in critically ill paediatric patients. The prospective enrollment by Italian children hospitals is ongoing since February 2021. A retrospective analysis was conducted by Italian centres from January 2018 to February 2021.Results:50 patients were enrolled. PELOD-2 score at PICU admission was 7.38 (SD 4.29, risk of mortality 10.60%) and before hemoperfusion 8.72 (SD 4.44, risk of mortality 16.46%). Clinical indications to hemoperfusion were sepsis or septic shock (29 patients), liver failure (4 patients), rhabdomyolysis (4 patients), hearth surgery (3 patients) and other indications (11 patients). CytoSorb® has been applied in CKRT (56% of cases), ECMO (32%), hemoperfusion (6%) and cardiac by-pass (6%) (Fig. 1). Median time of hemoperfusion was 3 days and median number of sorbents used was 3. Anticoagulation in extracorporeal circuits has been managed with heparin (71% of cases) and regional anticoagulation with citrate (29%). 8 adverse events were recorded (hemodynamic instability at hemoperfusion starting, haemodilution, circuit clotting and thrombocytopenia).Conclusions:Our data demonstrates that CytoSorb® therapy is safe and feasible in children.

Use of CytoSorb, treatment indications and adverse eventsP176CytoSorb for apixaban clearanceA Harris, NJ LeesHarefield Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Uxbridge, UKCritical Care2023,27(S1): P176Introduction:Planned cessation of oral anticoagulation (DOAC) prior to elective surgery is straightforward, however challenges arise when urgent treatment is required [1]. Patients taking DOACs have an increased risk of mortality due to bleeding so it is essential to have effective tools to reduce circulating levels prior to emergency surgery [1]. Use of CytoSorb haemoadsorber (Cytosorbents) [2] is EU approved to remove rivaroxaban during on pump cardiac surgery [3], but only a few case reports exist of its effects on apixaban [4,5].Methods:A patient presented with decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury (AKI), with a background of rheumatic heart disease, multiple cardiac surgeries and apixaban use for atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) and required renal replacement therapy (RRT). At admission, serum apixaban levels were 204 ng/ml, 40% higher than upper limit of normal and the patient was commenced on RRT. After 4 h, apixaban levels continued to rise so the CytoSorb haemoadsorber was added to the filtration system (Prismaflex).Results:After 3.5 h, apixaban levels were reduced by 77% and the patient experienced no adverse bleeding; this was essential for their heart transplant assessment (Fig. 1). After removal of the CytoSorb at 14 h, the apixaban remained at safe levels and RRT was stopped 4 days later.Conclusions:Approximately 27% of apixaban clearance is via the kidneys [6], so AKI can lead to bleeding due to dangerously high levels.

    "full_text": "underlying mechanism is unclear. As it has been postulated that low plasma cholesterol could partly be due to an increased conversion to cortisol, we hypothesized that hydrocortisone (HC) treatment, via reduced de novo adrenal corticosterone (CORT) synthesis, might improve cholesterol availability and as such affect the adrenal gland and skeletal muscle.Methods:In a catheterized, fluid-resuscitated, antibiotics-treated mouse model of prolonged sepsis (5 d), septic mice received either HC (1.2 mg/d) or placebo, whereas healthy mice served as controls (N = 50). Plasma CORT, cholesterol, and adrenocortical cholesterol ester content were quantified. Steroidogenic capacity of ACTH was evaluated in an adrenal explant study. Total body mass loss was measured to evaluate CORT-induced wasting in addition to ex vivo muscle force, myofiber size and mRNA expression of atrogenes(Trim63,Fbox32, Foxo3) and regeneration markers (Myostatin,Myf5,Myogenin).Results:Plasma CORT was normalized in HC septic mice, whereas the sepsis-induced reduction in plasma HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, and adrenocortical cholesterol ester content was attenuated as compared with placebo septic mice (p< 0.05), but without improving the blunted ACTH-induced CORT secretion (p= 0.5). Total body mass was median 13% further decreased in HC septic mice (p< 0.01) as compared with placebo septic mice, with no additional effect on sepsis-induced loss in muscle mass, force and myofiber size (p > 0.05). The sepsis-induced rise in muscle atrogenes was not further affected by HC treatment (p > 0.05), whereasMyostatinandMyf5/Myogeninexpression was respectively increased (p= 0.0003) and decreased (p< 0.05), as compared with placebo septic mice.Conclusions:Glucocorticoid treatment partly restored the sepsis-induced hypocholesterolemia without improving adrenal function, and at a cost of exacerbated loss of total body mass and suppressed muscle regeneration mechanisms.P178Effects of enrichment strategies on outcome of adrecizumab treatment in septic shock: post-hoc analyses of the phase II AdrenOSS-2 trialDPT van Lier1, A Picod2, G Marx3, PF Laterre4, O Hartmann5, F Azibani6, J Struck7, K Santos8, A Mebazaa2, P Pickkers11Radboudumc, Intensive Care, Nijmegen, Netherlands,2hôpital Lariboisière, Anesthésie-réanimation, Paris, France,3Universitätsklinikum Aachen, Klinik fur Operative Intensivmedizin und Intermediate Care, Aachen, Germany,4Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Unité de Soins Intensifs, Bruxelles, Belgium,5Sphingotec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany,6Hôpital Lariboisière, 2.

The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality. The key secondary endpoint was Major Adverse Kidney Events on day 90 (MAKE90). A pre-unblinding modified MAKE90 was defined as death up to Day 90, RRT through Day 28 and on Day 90, > 25% drop in eGFR at Day 90, rehospitalization to Day 90.Results:The trial stopped for futility after 649 inclusions (placebo n = 319; IA n = 330) following a planned interim analysis with an observed 28-day mortality of 27.9% on both arms. No safety concerns were identified. A beneficial effect on the modified MAKE90 was observed (p= 0.031) (Fig. 1), mainly driven by reduction of the number of patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) (28.2% Ilofotase alfa vs 36.4% placebo).

The patients received intraoperativly an average of 8.44 ml/kg/h of volume of which a restrictive approach was used in 5 patients. The highest infused volume was 14.08 ml/kg/h. BLS was independent of intraoperativly infused volume in both measurements (p= 0.823, vrsp= 0.113).Preoperative albumin values were in range between 25 and 47 g/l with an average of 35.9 ± 6.62 g/l. BLSs were between ≤ 5 and ≥ 15. Four patients had BLS > 15 24 h versus two 48 h after admission (Fig. 1).

Their safety profile is under scrutiny due to increased risk of renal failure and allergic reactions, as albumin remains as the mainstay of colloid therapy. We aimed to explore associations between types of colloids administered in CRS-HIPEC and postoperative outcomes.Methods:A cohort of patients taken to CRS-HIPEC from 2007 to 2020 at a university hospital were analyzed retrospectively. We compared outcomes for two groups: albumin only, and hyroxyethyl starch (HES, Voluven 6% ®) or oxypolygelatine (OPG. Gelifundol 5.5%). HES/OPG were used at our institution from 2007 to 2013. Outcomes were ICU length of stay (LOS), total LOS, ICU readmission, inpatient mortality, time for extubation, need for tracheostomy, time to ambulation and oral feeds, need for transfusion, estimated blood loss, intraoperative crystalloids, and units of red blood cells and plasma transfused in surgery.Results:148 patients were included. 98 (60%) patients received albumin, and 50 (30%) HES/OPG.

Primary treatment of sepsis patients consists of resuscitation with crystalloids. However, crystalloids aggravate endothelial permeability, which may be related to low protein content. We hypothesized that resuscitation with plasma compared to crystalloids limits endothelial and organ injury in a pneumosepsis rat model.Methods:Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 11) were intratracheally inoculated with 5 × 108Streptococcus pneumoniaeand randomized to receive no resuscitation (NR) or resuscitation with a fixed volume (8 ml/kg) of either Ringer’s lactate (RL) or rat derived fresh frozen plasma (rFFP). Healthy controls received sham inoculation. Five hours after start of resuscitation, animals were infused with FITC-dextran and sacrificed. Pulmonary FITC-dextran leakage and plasma levels of thrombomodulin and syndecan-1 were measured as markers of endothelial injury. To assess organ injury, pulmonary wet/dry ratios and histopathology injury scores were measured.Results:Pneumosepsis increased median lactate levels (2.77 vs 1.56 mmol/l,p= 0.001), lung wet/dry ratios (5.6 vs 4.3,p< 0.01) and pulmonary FITC leakage (134 vs 52 µg/mL,p= 0.01) compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1 (abstract P182)). rFFP did not reduce median pulmonary FITC-leakage"

However, increases to blood pressure and other hemodynamic changes are limited in duration and scope. This study investigates if changes to mean arterial pressure (MAP) after fluid bolus (FB) are altered by fluid temperature.Methods:Eighteen healthy volunteers are randomly allocated to 30 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate at cold (15 °C) or body (37 °C, warm) temperature over 30 min. For 2 h after starting the FB, we measured MAP, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate continuously. We recorded temperature every 15 min. In a second session, volunteers crossed over.Results:15 min after the FB was administered, mean MAP increased more with cold fluids (+ 6.5 mmHg [95% CI 4.8–8.2]) vs warm fluids (+ 0.6 mmHg [95% CI −1.6 to 2.8];P< 0.001) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a minimum increase in MAP of ≥ 5 mmHg was observed over longer periods of time after cold FB (51 min [95% CI 38–65]) vs warm FB (11 min [95% CI 0–21];p< 0.001). Pulse rate decreased similarly in both groups (−8.8 beats/min [95% CI −4.8 to −12.8] versus −5.4 beats/min [95% CI −1.7 to −9.2];p= 0.35). The temperature decreased more drastically after cold FB (−0.3°Celsius [95% CI −0.1 to −0.4]) vs warm FB (−0.1°C [95% CI 0 to −0.2],p= 0.02).Conclusions:Intravenous FB at cold temperature leads to a greater increase in MAP compared with body temperature, and the effect is more prolonged. These findings imply that in healthy volunteers, when a cold temperature FB is given, the temperature of the fluid rather than its volume accounts for most of the MAP increase.Fig. 1 (abstract P183).

Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis develops due to direct loss of sodium bicarbonate from GIT or administration of chloride rich solutions during resuscitation in these patients.In order to treat this, administering sodium bicarbonate makes physiological sense.Methods:After ethical approval and written informed consent, 90 patients (ages 18 to 60 year) diagnosed with perforated peritonitis and required emergency laparatomy surgery were randomaly allocated in two groups 45 each. Group ISB (isotonic sodium bicarbonate group) received 2 ml/kg/hr 1.3% isotonic bicarbonate and group BSS (balanced salt solution group) received 2 ml/kg/hr Ringer lactate (RL) as maintenance fluid during the intraoperative period. Primary outcome was to compare the difference in base excess (BE) between the two groups at the end of surgery. Secondary outcomes (pH, pCO2, HCO3, lactate levels, postoperative duration of mechanical ventilation, ionotrope requirement, ICU/HDU stay and incidence of acute kidney injury) were observed and compared at different time intervals between the groups.Results:The BE, median (Q1, Q3) was −7.30(−8.50, −6.30) in the ISS and −4.80(−6.80, −4.10) in the BSS group (p= 0.017) (Fig. 1).

Hypophosphatemia was defined as mild (0.64–0.8 mmol/l), moderate (0.32–0.63 mmol/l) or severe (< 0.32 mmol/l). Exclusion criteria were: chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 45 ml/min) and preoperative hypo- or hyperphosphatemia. The primary endpoint was hypophosphatemia immediately after surgery. The secondary endpoint, which was analysed in the subgroup of patients with hypophosphatemia, was persistent hypophosphatemia on day 1.Results:The incidence of immediate postoperative hypophosphatemia was 62.0% (623/1005), of which most was mild or moderate.

If mean arterial pressure remains inadeguate SSC suggests adding vasopressin (VA) [2]. Resistance Index (RI) is a power Doppler ultrasound assessment of vascular compliance to detect organ perfusion.Methods:Aim of this study is to compare RI in septic shock patients treated with NE (Group1), NE plus VA since the beginning of vasopressor therapy (Group2) and VA plus NE where VA is added if NE dosage was 20 mcg/min (Group3). RI were measured in renal artery (ARE), radial artery (AR), central retinal artery (CRA),superior mesenteric artery (AMS) at three different time points (T0) before vasopressor therapy, (T1) at 1 h, T2 at 24 h and T3 at 48 h.Results:48 patients were divided into three groups. 17 patients Group 1; 16 Group 2, 15 Group 3.

Correlations between all the variables analyzed at T0, T2 and T3 (a,b,c). Intensity of Red indicates inverse correlations, Blue indicates direct. There is a greater direct correlation at T3 between the dose of norepinephrine and the Resistance Index. The hypothesis that can be made to explain this is linked to \"receptor desensitization\", meaning that the dosage of norepinephrine must be increased over time to produce the desired effect (MAP > 65 mmHg), also causing an increase in side effects such as tachyphylaxis, vasoconstriction and therefore the increase in Resistance Indices.

Microcirculatory perfusion targeted resuscitation has been proposed as a tool to improve mortality in these patients. We hypothesized that microcirculation for non-survivers stays unchanged 24 and 48 h after admission compared to baseline, however, in survivors microcirculation improves in the first 48 h.Methods:We included 36 adult sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit within the previous 24 h who were receiving a noradrenaline infusion. Skin oxygen saturation in the knee area was measured using a hyperspectral imaging-based method at baseline, after 24 and 48 h. The primary outcome was an increase in skin oxygen saturation depending upon survival status at 28 days.Results:Median skin oxygen saturation changed from 11% (6–26) at baseline to 31 (23–33) % at 48 h in non-survivors and from 30% (23–36) to 28% (23–34) in survivors. There were significant differences in skin oxygen saturation between survivors and non-survivors at baseline (p< 0.01), but this difference was lost after 24 and 48 h. Independent baseline skin oxygen saturation predictors were APACHE II score and mean arterial pressure. Low baseline skin oxygen saturation was not associated with an increase in SOFA score over the first 2 days (r = − 0.38,p= 0.19).Conclusions:At admission to intensive care, skin oxygen saturation is significantly lower in non-survivors of septic shock. Over the early course of treatment, it increases to survivor levels and is similar in all patients after 48 h of intensive care.P192Predictive value of central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide tension in patients with ARDS treated with veno − venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)P Djimafo1, K Kaefer1, C Pierrakos1, D"

However, in theory, the unavoidable mixing of venous blood with blood after the oxygenator can affect PvaCO2values by increasing central venous oxygen saturation and substantially decreasing CO2concentration. This study aimed to evaluate acute changes in PvaCO2after VV-ECMO installation and determine its association with patient outcomes.Methods:Retrospectively evaluated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) ARDS patients with at least one concurrent arterial and central venous blood gas analysis before and after VV-ECMO installation as standard care. The primary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality at 28 days.Results:29 patients were enrolled in the study. All the patients had a 25 F drainage multistage femoral cannula and a 21 F internal jugular infusion cannula. The median distance between the central venous sampling point and the tip of the infusion cannula was 39 [23–73] mm. No statistically significant changes in PvaCO2were observed 24–48 h after VV-ECMO installation (5 [4–7] mmHg to 6.5 [5–8.2] mmHg,p= 0.12). Hemoglobin concentration decreased 24 to 48 h after VV-ECMO installation (10.7 [9.5–12.7] g/dl to 9.6 [8.8–11.6] g/dl,p< 0.01) but neither central venous (75 [70–81]% to 73 [67–78]%,p= 0.46) nor arterial oxygen saturation (95 [92–97]% to 95 [93–96]%,p= 0.81) changed significantly. Elevated PvaCO2after VV-ECMO installation had a good predictive value for 28 day ICU mortality (calculated area under the ROC curve 0.81) (Fig. 1 veno-venous).Conclusions:VV-ECMO support appears to have little effect on the PvaCO2calculation. PvaCO2can be used to evaluate patients with ARDS supported with VV-ECMO, as persistently elevated values can be associated with poor outcomes.Fig. 1 (abstract P192).

Classic RMs (30 cmH2O continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for 30 s) can cause hypotension. We evaluated whether ∆PI after RMs of 10 or 20 s could predict fluid responsiveness.Methods:Adult patients having elective surgery under general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation and an arterial line were included. After induction and hemodynamic stabilization (T0), a RM (30 cmH2O of CPAP) was performed for 10 s (RM10). Hemodynamic variables, pulse pressure variation (PPV) and PI (index finger) were obtained before and during RM10and relative changes calculated. After return of SV to T0 values, a 20-s RM (RM20) was performed and the same variables measured. Crystalloid fluid (250 ml over 10 min) was then infused and fluid responsiveness (SV increase ≥ 10%) assessed. SV and PPV were recorded using pulse contour analysis. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of variables (T0) and their changes were calculated.Results:Thirty-two patients were studied: 18 (53%) were fluid responders (FRs). At T0, only PPV was higher in FRs than in non-FRs. SV, mean arterial pressure and PI decreased during RM10and RM20, whereas PPV increased. ∆SV (16.8 ± 0.8 vs 36.2 ± 0.7%,p< 0.05) and ∆PPV (36.7 ± 1.5 vs 73.4 ± 1.8%,p< 0.05) were lower after RM10than after RM20. ∆PI were higher in FRs than in non-FRs for RM10and RM20(Table 1 (abstract P193)).

Current intraoperative blood pressure management is mainly reactive—with hypotension being treated only after it has occurred. Predictive hemodynamic monitoring may be a promising approach to help clinicians reduce intraoperative hypotension. The Acumen™ Hypotension Prediction Index software (HPI-software) (Edwards Lifesciences; Irvine, CA, USA) was developed to predict hypotension. We built up the European, multicenter, prospective, observational EU-HYPROTECT registry to describe the incidence, duration, and severity of intraoperative hypotension when using HPI-software monitoring in patients having non-cardiac surgery.Methods:We enrolled 749 patients scheduled for elective major non-cardiac surgery in 12 medical centers in 5 European countries. All patients had intraarterial blood pressure monitoring with an arterial catheter and intraoperative HPI-software monitoring. The primary endpoint of this registry was intraoperative hypotension quantified using the time-weighted average mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with at least one ≥ 1-min-episode of a MAP < 65 mmHg, and the number of ≥ 1-min-episodes of a MAP < 65 mmHg.Results:Between September 2021 and May 2022, we enrolled 749 patients in the registry and included 702 patients in the final analysis. The median time-weighted average MAP < 65 mmHg was 0.03 (0.00, 0.20) mmHg (Fig. 1). 285 patients (41%) had no ≥ 1-min-episode of a MAP < 65 mmHg—417 patients (59%) had at least one. The median number of ≥ 1-min-episodes of a MAP < 65 mmHg was 1 (0, 3).Conclusions:The median time-weighted average MAP < 65 mmHg was very low in patients in this registry. This suggests that using HPI-software monitoring may help reduce the duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension in patients having non-cardiac surgery.Fig. 1 (abstract P194).

To automatically monitor LV function, we have developed a method for measuring mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) by combining transesophageal echocardiography with artificial intelligence:AutoMAPSE(Fig. 1A). Our objective is to assess the feasibility of AutoMAPSE in intensive care, and to compare its bias and least significant change (LSC) against manual measurements.Methods:We obtained midesophageal two- and four-chamber views of three beats in 40 intensive care patients. Off-line, we measured MAPSE manually and with AutoMAPSE in four LV walls in all available beats. We defined AutoMAPSE asfeasiblewhen it was obtainable from at least one beat in one wall. To assessbiasand limits of agreement (LOA),we used Bland–Altman analysis. We calculatedLSCfor each method, which is the least difference between two measurements required before a change is considered real.Results:AutoMAPSE had a feasibility of 96.2%. Bland–Altman analysis showed that AutoMAPSE had a low bias (Fig. 1B), ranging from −0.2 mm (anterior wall, LOA: −3.4 to 3.1 mm) to −1.1 mm (septal wall, LOA: −4.1 to 2.4 mm). AutoMAPSE had higher LSC than manual measurements when comparing a single measurement (5.4 vs 4.7 mm). When AutoMAPSE is set to measure more beats than manual, its LSC is reduced (LSC for two beats: 3.8 mm).Conclusions:AutoMAPSE is feasible in intensive care patients. Compared to manual measurements, AutoMAPSE had low bias. By using AutoMAPSE to measure more beats, its LSC is reduced.Fig. 1 (P195).ALeft ventricular function monitored using AutoMAPSE.

Appropriate training is pertinent for all ED/ICU practitioners, and procedural proficiency is expected. Many departments have ultrasound machines, yet the vast majority of doctors are engaging in self-directed learning in this regard. We evaluated the training received by doctors in ultrasound-guided (U/S) PVC and CVC.Methods:An electronic survey was disseminated to all ranks of practitioner from several hospital departments, and reviewed levels of training, competence and procedural preferences in both U/S-PVC and CVC.Results:A total of 148 eSurvey responses were received (response rate of 52%). Regarding U/S-PVC, 68% of respondents had never been taught with 65% achieving this previously, and 12% attempting to do so but failing. For CVC, 61% have inserted them. Of these, 84% always use ultrasound and 16% elect to use either ultrasound or an anatomical landmark-based technique. 55% have undergone formal training. Despite this, 10,2%, 9,6% and 11.3% of these individuals have not received training in the procedure itself, sterility during the procedure or post CVC protocols, respectively. When reviewing operator preference for specific U/S-CVC sites, participants expressed varying levels of confidence (see Fig. 1). Respondents wishing to receive formal, comprehensive training on U/S-PVC and U/S-CVC totaled 72% and 76%, respectively.Conclusions:U/S-PVC & CVC ability varied significantly in a large academic hospital.

In RALP, dTD position (25°–45°) is performed following pneumoperitoneum [1]. In dTD position, although protection of cardiac output is expected caused by increased venous return, a decrease in hemodynamic parameters can be seen because of gravity and increased intrathoracic pressure [2].Methods:After ethical approval, this study was designed as a prospective observational study. Thirty patients with malignant prostate cancer who were > 18 years old, and had no chronic heart failure, valvular disease, arrhythmia, and myocardial ischemia in the last 3 months were included in the study. All invasive cardiac parameters and longitudinal strain (SL) achieved transesophageal echocardiography were recorded in pre-dTD (T3) and 10thminute of dTD (T4). Delta values were calculated for CCE and SL (values at T4minus values at T3).

With a simulated human bleeding model on whole blood donor volunteers, we sought to identify early signatures of bleeding using a supervised machine learning model.Methods:51 adult human subjects donated whole blood (mean age 49 ± 18 years; 55% male). On average, subjects pre-bleed hemoglobin was 14.3 g/dl, and 495 ml of blood was donated during 7 min 3 s. Each individual was instructed to stand and sit before and after donation to obtain orthostatic blood pressures. Noninvasive vital signs including electrocardiogram (250 Hz) and photoplethysmography (125 Hz) were obtained from a portable MP50 monitor, and non-invasive arterial waveform (100 Hz) with cardiac indices were acquired from a LiDCOrapid device. During donation, blood volume loss was documented each minute. Data were curated and 20 s moving time windows were extracted every 10 s. From these time windows, statistical, time-series, and morphologic features were computed. A random forest classifier was trained to identify bleeding events using these features, which were normalized by their non-bleeding baseline period before any orthostatic changes.Results:Our model, evaluated using a leave-one-patient-out cross validation scheme, demonstrated high performance in detecting bleeding using only non-invasive vital sign features: the mean AUROC was 0.955, and the TPR and TNR at clinically relevant low error regions (1% FPR & 1% FNR) were 55% and 46% (Fig. 1).

Early detection of bleeding is mandatory to improve outcomes but is difficult due to physiological responses and unreliable vital signs monitoring. We explored the discriminative ability of a novel deep learning (DL) framework on arterial waveforms to classify levels of ongoing hypovolemia in a new dynamic version of the lower body negative pressure (LBNP) model.Methods:Healthy subjects (n = 23) with invasive radial arterial pressure had three runs of LBNP (69 trials). The LBNP levels (range 0 to −60 mmHg) in each run were randomized in order to; 1) circumvent the time dependency of measurements, and 2) mimic both bleeding and fluid resuscitation (dynamic model). A supervised DL-based framework for ternary classification was realized by segmenting the underlying invasive signal and labeling segments with corresponding LBNP target levels. The DL framework had two inputs that were trained with respective time–frequency representations extracted on waveform segments to classify each of them into blood volume loss: Class 1 (mild); Class 2 (moderate); or Class 3 (severe). At the outset, the latent space derived from the unified DL model via late fusion among both inputs assisted in enhancing classification performance.Results:The experimental study was performed using threefold cross-validation based on a patient-wise stratification scheme. i.e., within each fold, the model is trained and developed using a unique 70% (16 subjects) of total data, and the remaining 30% (7 subjects) data is considered for validation. In a threefold cross-validation setup with stratified subjects, the experimental findings demonstrated AUROC: 0.84, AUPRC: 0.73, and F1-score: 69.12% (Fig. 1).Conclusions:Our proposed DL algorithm on arterial"

An open question is whether frequent urinary measurements in ICU patients will detect relevant changes. Thus we examined if semi-continuous quantitative monitoring of urine might be useful in the ICU.Methods:Patients with a range of indications for ICU-admission and different length of stays in the ICU were included. For each patient, 20 urine samples were collected every 15 min for 5 h. In addition to urinary volume, samples were analyzed at the clinical chemistry laboratory for 10 parameters: diuresis, creatinine, urea, glucose, natrium, chloride, kalium, phosphate, total protein and albumin as well as the anion gap. Data were analyzed in R studio and examined for bivariate correlations, specific patterns and rapid changes of these parameters. For each patient and parameter, the ratio between the median value and highest/lowest value was determined. The frequency distributions of these ratios are shown to illustrate the dynamics.Results:In 209 patients 3892 samples were analyzed. Remarkably rapid and pronounced changes were seen in all parameters (Fig. 1). The independent behavior of the studied parameters was underscored by limited bivariate correlations that ranged fromR= −0.19 (creatinine and sodium) toR= + 0.84 (albumin and total protein).

BIA measurements were performed 1 h before and after general anesthesia. Intraoperatively standard monitoring was applied. Perspiratio insensibilis were accepted as 0.5 ml/kg/h and net balance was calculated. BodyStat Multiscan 5000 and manufacturer’s electrodes were used. Overhydration (OHY), total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and intracellular water (ICW) were the analyzed parameters.Results:40 patients aged 59.15 ± 9.68 years with BMI 27.1 ± 4.3 kg/cm2and duration of the procedure 189.75 ± 87.63 min were involved in the study. There were 18 laparotomies, 15, thoracotomies and 7 craniotomies. Calculated net balance was 1344.64 ± 533.02 ml. TBW, ECW, ICW and OHY increased from the respective 44.84 ± 10.38 l, 15.08 ± 3.35 l, 29.66 ± 7.29 l, -0.77 ± 0.84 to 46.38 ± 10.57 l, 16.62 ± 3.52 l, 29.76 ± 7.3 l, 1.28 ± 0.75.

In critically ill patients central venous catheter (CVC) placement is a commonly performed procedure with potential serious complications [1]. Various techniques to ascertain CVC tip placement (CVCtp) include anatomical landmark-guided methods, CXR and right atrium (RA) ECG.Methods:All 128 patients enrolled in the study were hospitalized in Siena ICU, ‘Anestesia e Rianimazione’ department. Data were collected from 1° January 2022 to 31° June 2022 and retrospectively compared to data of 2021. The ECGgt included the metallic wire technique (CVC Braun Certofix + ECG adapter kit) and the fluid column technique (ECG VygoCard Kit). With ECGgt an accurate analysis of the P-shape at the ECG monitor was required. By monitoring the P-wave, we were able to determine CVCtp as it travelled through SVC-RA and RA.Results:Out of the 128 patients 106 patients underwent positioning of a CVC with ECGgt (82.8%), for 22 the procedure was contraindicated. Of the 106 CVC, 80 were PICC, 26 were CICC. Intra-procedural complication rate was 1.8%. 80 patients received CXR after ECGgt and correct positioning was confirmed in 100% of cases. Data of 2022 showed that ECGgt had a 49% increase (34,1% in 2021 and 84% in 2022). Conversely a decrease in CXR was shown (Fig. 1).Conclusions:Our study shows that ECGgt is a safe, reliable technique and a potential valid alternative to CXR. The advantages of ECGgt are the high feasibility, the catheter being operable just after the procedure, the optimisation of resources in the ICU and patients/health care staff x-rays exposure being avoided.ReferenceSoldati G. et al.

We sought to address whether placement of a CVC influences this. There have been conflicting results from trials of goal-directed therapy [2–3], but avoidance of aggressive fluid loading appears to be associated with better outcome [4].Methods:The study was granted Health Research Authority approval (London Central). All adult patients presenting to our institution for elective major colorectal resection, with planned postoperative critical care, were included between May 2019 and March 2020. Primary outcome measure was the difference in mean fluid volume infused between the two groups (‘CVC Inserted’ and ‘No CVC’). Student's T-Test was used to compare means between the two groups. Where this was not appropriate, differences in median values were calculated using non-parametric methods (i.e. Mann Whitney U Test).Results:40 patients were recruited (17 'CVC Inserted' and 23 ‘No CVC’). There were significantly lower median volumes of both crystalloid and total intravenous fluid volume (1800 ml vs. 3000 ml;pvalue < 0.0001, 95% CI 750–1950 ml and 750–1800 ml respectively) infused in the ‘CVC Inserted’ group. Postoperative fluid volumes demonstrated a trend for reduced fluid volume in the ‘CVC Inserted’ group, however this did not reach statistical significance for either total crystalloid (460 ml vs. 980 ml; p value = 0.0633, 95% CI 0–940 ml) or weight and time adjusted fluid volume (0.012 ml/kg/min vs. 0.015 ml/kg/min; p value = 0.0880, 95% CI − 0.001 to 0.015 ml/kg/min).Conclusions:An average of 40% less fluids were given to the ‘CVC inserted group’ in our study across the perioperative period.

In 11 patients, FB increased CI (1.86 [1.41–2.77] ml/min/m2to 2.27 ml/min/m2[1.82–3.33],p< 0.01) without statistically significant changes in central venous pressure (3.1 [1.0–8.3] mmHg to 4.0 [2.0–9.5],p= 0.44). In these patients, a trend for decreasing LV − MPI was observed (0.47 [0.36–0.48] to 0.34 [0.28–0.41],p= 0.17) (Fig. 1).Conclusions:Fluid bolus (FB) induced acute preload changes which did not affect LV − MPI.

The aim of volume expansion is to improve organ perfusion and oxygenation by increasing cardiac output. However, after cardiac surgery, there is marked dissociation between cardiac output and tissue oxygenation due to the deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on the microcirculation. We investigated the utility of mitochondrial oxygen tension (mitoPO2) to guide fluid therapy in patients after cardiac surgery by measurements of cardiac output in parallel with mitoPO2. MitoPO2is a novel bed-side quantitative marker which measures the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption in the skin.Methods:Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were included.

We hypothesized that a transient decrease in PEEP (PEEP-test) may be used as a test to detect volume responsiveness.Methods:Mechanically ventilated patients with PEEP ≥ 10 cmH2O (“high level”) and without spontaneous breathing were prospectively included. Volume responsiveness was assessed by a positive passive leg raising (PLR) test, defined as an increase in cardiac index (CI) during PLR ≥ 10%. The PEEP-test consisted in reducing PEEP from the high level to 5 cmH2O for one minute. Changes in CI were monitored with pulse-contour-derived CI (PiCCO2).Results:We included 64 patients among whom 31 were volume responsive. The increase in CI during PLR was 14%(11–16%). The PEEP at baseline was 12(10–15) cmH2O and the PEEP-test resulted in a median decrease in PEEP of 7(5–10) cmH2O, without difference between volume responsive and unresponsive patients. Among volume responsive patients, the PEEP-test induced a significant increase in CI of 16%(12–20%) (from 2.4 ± 0.7 to 2.9 ± 0.9 L/min/m2,p< 0.001) compared to volume unresponsive patients.

Nonetheless, assessment of fluid responsiveness (FR) has many confounders. Systolic volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) are validated as surrogate markers for FR, but some conditions limit their application: low tidal volume (VT) (< 8 ml/kg), right heart (RH) disfunction, high intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), low compliance, dysrhythmia, and patient triggered respiratory cycles. We conducted a prospective pragmatic study with the aim of characterizing the prevalence of these limitations in a cohort of patients with SC.Methods:Patients were included in the first 24 h after SC recognition, identified by hyperlactacidemia and vasopressor dependence associated with presumed or declared infection. Hemodynamic (HD) data was gathered whenever a FR assessment was performed. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were also collected.Results:Twenty-three patients were included (Table 1), of which 20 had a minimally invasive HD monitoring device. There were limitations in 76.2% of the patients: 9 had a VT < 8 ml/kg, 9 had RH disfunction, 3 had high IAP, 2 had low compliance, 6 had dysrhythmia and 10 patients had patient triggered respiratory cycles. About 56.2% of the patients only had one limitation, 25% had two limitations and 18.8% had three. ICU mortality was 45%. Table 1 summarizes other important data collected.Conclusions:In this preliminary study, the use of SVV or PPV to assess fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock had many limitations.

Usually, benefits are based on fluid responsiveness (FR) assessment. Defining FR is essential to avoid iatrogenesis. We hypothesized that heart rate (HR) variation, evaluated before and after a fluid challenge, might be a useful tool to validate fluid responsiveness.Methods:The study was performed in a large urban, university hospital. Patients were included in the first 24 h after SC recognition, identified by hyperlactacidemia and vasopressor dependence associated with presumed or declared infection. Whenever clinical judgement recommended, fluid challenge was performed (500 mL crystalloid infusion in 30 min), without other interventions. FR data was evaluated with echocardiography and considered to be present when there was a 10% increase in cardiac output (CO) or left ventricle outflow tract-velocity time integral (VTI). An average of three VTI and peak velocity measures was used. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and other hemodynamic variables were collected, including HR prior and after FR.Results:Preliminary assessment of data was performed in 23 patients. Three of which were excluded due to poor acoustic TE window. ICU mortality was 45%. All patients were under noradrenaline (NA); 19 were under invasive mechanical ventilation, 2 with non-invasive ventilation and 2 were spontaneously breathing. Table 1 summarizes other important data collected. Using the aforementioned FR definition, we identified 12 responsive and 8 nonresponsive patients. Mean HR variation was -3% (± 9.6; −18 to 22%). In responsive patients, there was no correlation between ΔVTI% and ΔHR% (p= 0.235) nor between ΔVTI% and ΔHR% if initial HR > 100 (p= 0.114).Conclusions:In this pragmatic study, preliminary data suggests that ΔHR does not correlate with ΔVTI and cannot predict fluid responsiveness.Table 1 (abstract P213).

Skin mottling is well studied in Caucasian population and its validity as a clinical sign in dark skinned ethnic population is not known. Our aim was to study the mottling in septic shock in the Indian ethnic population who has different skin colour as compared to Caucasian population.Methods:We conducted a prospective observational study of consecutive patients with skin colour category 21–34 on von Luschan scale or Fitzpatrick type IV and V who had septic shock needing high dose of norepinephrine ≥ 0.2 mcg/kg/min after fluid optimisation.The study was conducted in a mixed medical—surgical ICU over a span of 12 months. Two experts (a dermatologist and a cosmetic surgeon) independently classified the skin type and scored mottling in our patients. We recorded the demographics, hemodynamic variables, mottling score and observed for the incidence of mottling and its correlation with predictors of severity of septic shock.Results:We included 108 patients. Mean age was 61.3 years. Mean SOFA score and APACHE II score at enrolment was 10.3 and 21.9 respectively. Overall mortality was 72%. Incidence of mottling was 22/86 (20.3%). Development of mottling was significantly associated with APACHE II score > 22, SOFA score > 10 and norepinephrine dose > 0.3 mcg/kg/min (Table 1). Occurrence of mottling irrespective of its grade was strongly associated with mortality 19/22 (86.3%) (p= 0.028).Conclusions:Incidence of mottling in septic shock is much less in Indian ethnicity with brown skin colour as compared to Caucasian population.

There is little consensus in the ICU on how to monitor patients’ readiness for fluid removal beyond the initial decompensated phase of cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography-based tools help in assessing hemodynamic status. We look at various Echo and Lab parameters to see if fluid removal can be dictated by them.Methods:A retrospective single-center observational study was performed on 69 patients diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and on mechanical circulatory support. We collected echocardiographic parameters, lab values, vital signs, medications, and outcomes for 24 h from the day that echocardiograms were performed. This data was analyzed to study the association with bad outcomes. A bad outcome was defined by—fluid administration after diuresis, or an increase in vasopressor requirements. We used R 4.2.2 for statistical analysis and chi-square test or Fischer’s exact test used to calculate p values.Results:Most of the patients in our cohort were males (78.3%) and of white (58%) ethnicity. 13% of them were on IABP, and 87% were on Impella devices, with Impella 5.5 being the most common (68.3%). 80% of our total cohort survived the hospital stay. Our analysis of 242 serial observations revealed that patients in the bad outcome category had more negative fluid balance [(− 995 ± 2040 vs. − 96 ± 1760);p< 0.001], and a higher prevalence (28.2% vs. 18.6%,p= 0.011) of reduced IVC collapsibility (< 50%) than the better outcome group. Relevant results are demonstrated in Table 1.Conclusions:Beyond initial fluid optimization, echo-guided determination of volume status with euvolemic states is associated with better outcomes. Aggressive attempts to obtain a negative fluid balance is associated with poor short-term outcomes. Further prospective trials are required to determine causality.Table 1 (abstract P215).

We included all patients with sepsis aged over 18 years and admitted to the ED. RSI and quick sequential organ fail assessment (qSOFA) were calculated at admission. We have determined the predictive factors of in-hospital mortality in uni and multivariate analysis. The area under the ROC curve of the rSI was analyzed.Results:We enrolled 185 patients. The average age was 64 ± 16 years. The Sex ratio was 1.17. In-hospital mortality was 31.4%.

In preparation for a large phase 4 randomised controlled trial we aimed to identify an optimal target population for this vasopressor.Methods:Post-hoc analysis of the data from the Phase 3 Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock trial was performed in a sub-population of patients with AKI to evaluate the effect of angiotensin II on mortality and renal-replacement therapy (RRT) utilisation. AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. For comparisons between treatment arms, Fisher’s exact test or the chi-square test or the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied.Results:From a total of 321 patients with distributive shock, 203 patients (63%) had AKI (stage 1: 25 patients (12.3%), stage 2: 42 patients (20.7%), stage 3: 136 patients (67%)). Among AKI patients 98 received angiotensin II and 105 received placebo.

Little is known about how peripheral vasopressors are used in practice or how safety data from existing small, single-center studies extrapolate to routine care.Methods:We conducted a post hoc analysis of peripheral vasopressor use in the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial, which enrolled 1563 patients with early sepsis-induced hypotension in 60 US hospitals (3/2018–2/2022). Trial protocol allowed vasopressor administration through central access or a large peripheral IV, per discretion of the treating team, with vasopressor monitoring guided by local hospital protocols. We analyzed peripheral vasopressor use and assessed complications among patients treated with peripheral vasopressors and with CVC placement. Complications were graded on a 5-point scale from no clinical effect (1) to death (5).Results:Of 1563 patients enrolled in CLOVERS, 750 (48.0%) received vasopressors, including 500 (32.0%) who received vasopressors peripherally. 363 patients (23.2%) had a CVC placed within 72 h of study enrollment, including 234 (64.5%) who received peripheral vasopressors prior to CVC placement and 129 (35.5%) who did not. Use of peripheral vasopressors did not vary over the study period (p= 0.39 for trend). Complications occurred in 3/500 patients who received peripheral vasopressors (0.6%; 0 Grade 3 +), and in 14/363 patients who had a CVC placed (3.9%; 42.9% Grade 3 +).Conclusions:In this large, multicenter trial, peripheral vasopressor use"

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to midodrine (enteral, 10 mg every 8 h) or placebo for the duration of their IV vasopressor therapy and 24 h following the discontinuation of their IV vasopressor therapy. The investigation product (IP) was administered orally, or by ng tube. Primary outcomes were feasibility of recruitment and duration of IV vasopressor support. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, 90 day all-cause mortality, rates of ICU re-admission, rates of re-initiation of IV vasopressors and safety endpoints.Results:20 patients were enrolled into the study. One patient withdrew consent prior to data collection. 11 patients were assigned to midodrine and 9 to placebo. Median age was 60 (49.5–64.5) and 56.5 (43.2–68.2) respectively. 54.5% of the midodrine group were female vs 12.5% in the placebo group. Median APACHE II scores were 24.0 (19.5–27.5) and 17.5 (11.5–27.2). Treatment interventions measured included invasive mechanical ventilation (72.7% and 75.0%), CRRT (9.1% and 12.5%), IV hydrocortisone (36.4% and 37.5%) and blood products (45.4% and 37.5%). Outcomes measured included total duration of IV vasopressor support (hours) (48.6 (20.2–120.5) and 37.5 (21.4–81.0), vasopressors re-initiated over 24 h after ICU discharge (36.4% and 25.0%), ICU mortality (9.1% and 37.5%), hospital mortality (18.2% and 37.5%) and ICU length of stay 6.0 (2.5–14.8) and 4.2 (3.2–6.2) days. No adverse events related to the IP were identified.Conclusions:This pilot study provides evidence that recruitment into a larger multi-site RCT is feasible to evaluate the role of midoddrine in earlier liberation from IV vasopressor therapy.P222Effects of levosimendan on cardiovascular performance in critically ill patientsTY Kim, EM Bowcock, CF Duncan, RA Rowley, SR OrdeNepean Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Kingswood, AustraliaCritical Care2023,27(S1): P222Introduction:Cardiac dysfunction is a"

    "full_text": "P222Introduction:Cardiac dysfunction is a frequent complication in critically ill patients. Levosimendan is a unique inodilator that does not increase intracellular calcium concentration while relaxing vascular smooth muscle, hence, reducing preload and afterload of left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). There is still a lack of data assessing the trend of cardiovascular effects of levosimendan in critically ill patients.Methods:Single centre, retrospective parallel analysis of 49 patients with non-septic cardiomyopathy (NC) and septic cardiomyopathy (SC). Echocardiogram was performed median time of 1 day prior to levosimendan infusion and median time of 3 days after levosimendan infusion. Physiological markers were collected 24 h before and after therapy. Echocardiographic parameters of LV and RV function were measured by cardiac sonographers and reported by intensivists with advanced echocardiography qualifications. These values were compared between NC and SC.Results:Prior to the commencement of levosimendan infusion, patients received median amount of 46 ml/kg fluid resuscitation and 40% were on at least two cardiovascular support agents. pH and lactate improved after levosimendan therapy (7.3 vs 7.4,p< 0.01; 2.2 vs 1.3 mmol/l, p 0.01). LV ejection fraction, LV outflow tract velocity time integral (LVOT-VTI) and RVOT-VTI were higher post-therapy (31 vs 44%,p< 0.01; 12 vs 15 cm,p< 0.01; 7 vs 10 cm,p< 0.01). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion increased following therapy (15 vs 17 mm,p< 0.01). RVOT-VTI/pulmonary artery systolic pressure also improved (0.20 vs 0.25 cm/mmHg, p 0.03). Improvement in LV systolic function were more prominent in NC than SC.Conclusions:Early use of levosimendan infusion may be helpful in improving LV and RV systolic function in critically ill patients, especially in NC. It may also increase pulmonary artery compliance. Further prospective echocardiographic studies are required to assess its therapeutic benefit amongst pre-defined cardiac dysfunction phenotypes.P223Predictors for failure of early recovery after totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement (TEAVR)S Lambrecht1, J Dubois2, L Heremans1, D Vranken1, I Gruyters1, E Geerts1, I De Pauw1, L Geebelen1, B Stessel1, J Vandenbrande11Jessa, Anesthesiology & Intensive Care, Hasselt, Belgium,2Jessa, Critical Care, Hasselt, BelgiumCritical Care2023,27(S1): P223Introduction:We investigated the association between perioperative variables and failure for Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS).

Analgesia consists of the routine administration of acetaminophen and ketorolac (unless contra-indications) and supplemental opioids as needed. The primary purpose is to achieve extubation within 6 h after surgery, as stated in the ERACS guidelines. Hence, we defined EFa as intubation for more than 6 h postoperatively and/or ICU length of stay for more than 1 day. Based on the literature, 6 variables (Table 1) were analyzed as possible predictors for EFa. First, a univariate regression analysis was performed. Variables with p value < 0,1 were taken into the multivariate regression analysis.Results:Between 10/2019 and 12/2021, 176 TEAVR patients were included in the ERACS pathway. The ERACS trajectory was unsuccesful in 55/176 (31%) patients: 20/55 (36%) were intubated ≥ 6 h postoperatively, 40/55 (73%) were not discharged on postoperative day 1 and 5/55 (9%) had a combination of both. After multivariate regression analysis, the need for revision surgery < 24 h appeared to be the main risk factor for unsuccessful ERACS after TEAVR, whereas a higher EuroSCORE II showed no significant association with EFa. Preoperative use of RAAS inhibition did not appear to be a risk factor for failure of ERACS.Conclusions:Revision surgery within 24 h was the only identifiable risk factor for failure of the ERACS trajectory in our TEAVR patient population.Table 1 (abstract P223).

Twenty-three (39%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome and 12 (20%) were intubated for neurological impairment. The dose of norepinephrine was 0.46 (0.19–0.93) μg/kg/min in patients with shock.

Exploiting the full potential of airborne AED delivery would mandate 24 h UAS operability. However, current systems have not been evaluated for nighttime use [1, 2]. The primary goal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of night-time AED delivery by UAS. The secondary goal was to obtain and compare operational and safety data of night versus day operations.Methods:We scheduled two (one day, one night) flights each to ten different locations to assess the feasibility of AED delivery by UAS during night-time. We also compared operational data and safety data of night versus day missions.Results:All missions were completed without safety incident. The flights were performed automatically without interventions, apart from manually choosing the landing site and correcting the descent. Flight distances ranged from 910 to 6960 m, corresponding mission times from alert to AED release between 3:48 min and 11:20 min. Night missions (Tm:night= 7:26 ± 2:29 min) did not take longer than day missions (Tm:day= 7:59 ± 2:27 min). Despite inferior visibility of the target site at night, statistical analysis suggested non-inferiority of night landings versus day landings (p= 0.9).Conclusions:Our results demonstrate the feasibility of UAS supported AED delivery during nighttime. Operational and safety data indicate no major differences between day- and night-time use. Future research should focus on integration of drone technology into the chain of survival.ReferencesBaumgarten MC et al. Resuscitation 2022;172:139–145.Schierbeck S et al."

The objective is to compare the performances of 9 BVM in simulated pre-oxygenation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) conditions in terms of inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2), insufflated volume (VTi) and rebreathing.Methods: 9BVM were evaluated according to a specific bench protocol.Two levels of spontaneous breathing (occurring during pre-oxygenation) were simulated on an ASL test lung at ZEEP and PEEP 5 with 15 L/min O2for each BVM tested. Actual FiO2was measured and compared to the minimum 85% FiO2target imposed by the ISO standard.BVM ventilation during CPR was performed by healthcare volunteers on a specific manikin. Ventilation was tested during mechanical (Lucas 2) Interrupted Chest Compressions strategy (30:2) and after Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) according to CPR guidelines. 36 caregivers from 2 University Hospitals and 1 General Hospital provided manual ventilation.BVM were drilled to evaluate CO2rebreathing during simulated spontaneous ventilation.Results:Spontaneous breathing: The actual FiO2delivered did not reach 85% for Weinmann (32%), O-two (48%), Intersurgical Small (60%) and Laerdal (83%) (Fig. 1, Panel A). Interestingly, FiO2was above 85% in all BVM tested when a PEEP valve was added (Panel B).Ventilation during CPR and after ROSC: actual VTi delivered were in the target range 5 (± 1) ml/PBW but 4 BVM delivered significantly less volume (MI3, Mercury Small, Intersurgical Small and O-two).Rebreathing: 3 BVM (Intersurgical Adult, Mercury Small, Laerdal) showed significant CO2rebreathing.Conclusions:The 9 BVM tested exhibited varying performances on this bench study.

Our aim is to compare the time of airway establishment with a non-cuffed laryngeal device and ETI in patients with nontraumatic OHCA and to evaluate the effect of non-cuffed laryngeal device insertion and endotracheal intubation on the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).Methods:This study is a retrospective analysis of 479 patients in Lithuania who had an OHCA in whom resuscitation was attempted by emergency medical personnel with subsequent transport to medical institutions from January 2020 through December 2021. The primary outcome was ROSC on arrival at the hospital. The secondary outcome was successful ventilation using either ETI or a non-cuffed laryngeal device. Capnography measures between 35 and 45 mmHg were defined as successful ventilation following Kaunas city EMS protocol.Results:Among 479 enrolled patients, 3 were traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, and 166 patients received either no airway management device, or both a non-cuffed laryngeal device and EIT. These cases were excluded. 176 (36.9%) received a non-cuffed laryngeal device, and 129 (27.1%) received EIT as the primary airway management device. The remaining patients were managed without an advanced airway technique. ROSC on arrival at the hospital was achieved in 126 (26.4%) cases. Further study results will be presented.Conclusions:Among patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Kaunas city EMS, a non-cuffed laryngeal device insertion was associated with a greater ROSC on arrival to the hospital than ETI. These findings suggest that non-cuffed laryngeal device insertion may be considered an initial airway management strategy in patients with non-traumatic OHCA.

This may induce the recently described “intrathoracic airway closure” [1]. On the opposite, large insufflations above the FRC can generate thoracic distension and may jeopardize circulation. These phenomena affect differently capnogram during CC. The objective of the present study was to test whether a specific capnogram may identify thoracic distension during CPR and to assess the impact of thoracic distension on gas exchange and hemodynamics.Methods:In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, we identified on capnograms three patterns: intrathoracic airway closure, thoracic distension or regular pattern. An algorithm was designed to classify them automatically.To link CO2patterns with ventilation, we conducted two experiments: reproducing the CO2patterns in human cadavers exploring the impact of thoracic distension patterns on different circulation parameters during CPR on a pig model.Results:Clinical data: 202 capnograms were collected. Intrathoracic airway closure was present in 35%, thoracic distension in 22% and regular pattern in 43% (Fig. 1).Experiments:Higher insufflated volumes reproduced thoracic distension CO2patterns in 5 cadavers.In six pigs during CPR with various tidal volumes, a CO2pattern of thoracic distension, but not tidal volume per se, was associated with a significant decrease in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion.Conclusions:EtCO2interpretation during CC remains challenging. In this context, we proposed an original approach to identify and interpret more accurately expired CO2during CC. Both intrathoracic airway closure and thoracic distension can be identified using CO2patterns. Further research is needed to assess the impact on ventilation and circulation of a ventilatory strategy guided by capnograms.ReferenceGrieco et al.

However, many patients arriving to hospital are hypoxic with hypercarbia. One possible reason for the inadequate ventilation is due to the counterpressure caused by the continuous chest compressions (CCC). We hypothesized that a compression/ventilation ratio of 30:2 would provide better ventilation and gas exchange compared to CCC over ventilation during prolonged CPR. We wanted to explore the effect of adding 10 cmH2O PEEP to the protocols.Methods:We randomized 23 anaesthetized domestic swine (weight approximately 57 kg) with electrically induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) to CCC or 30:2 chest compressions and manual bag-valve ventilation with 100% FiO2and 10 cmH2O PEEP. We started CPR after a 5 min no-flow period and continued it up to 40 min from the induction of VF. Chest compressions were performed with a mechanical chest compression device (LUCAS®, Stryker Medical). The pigs were not defibrillated but received 3 standard doses of epinephrine i.v. during CPR. We collected arterial blood gas samples every 5 min during CPR. PaO2, PaCO2, and lactate over time were compared using a mixed linear model.Results:There were no statistically significant differences in PaO2(p= 0.11), PaCO2(p= 0.59), or lactate (p= 0.57) between continuous and 30:2 compression/ventilation groups (Fig. 1). Thepvalues for the interaction between compression/ventilation group and time were as follows: 0.25 for PaO2,0.96 for PaCO2, and 0.19 for lactate.Conclusions:Prolonged CPR with mechanical chest compressions performed either continuously or with a 30:2 compression/ventilation ratio with 10 cmH2O PEEP resulted in similar arterial levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and lactate.Fig. 1 (abstract P231).

CPV ventilation is a pressure control ventilation with a respiratory rate of 10 breath/min a FiO2of 1, an initial inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O and a positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. It includes a specific algorithm for high pressure that magnifies intrathoracic positive pressure during chest compression cardiac to increase the associated cardiac ejection; meanwhile it magnifies negative intrathoracic pressure during chest recoil, therefore enhancing venous return to the heart.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of all non-traumatic adult cardiac arrests recorded in the Belgian cardiac arrest registry (B-CAR) form January 2017 until December 2021. We excluded traumatic arrests, pregnant women and minors from the analysis. A multivariable logistic regression backward elimination model that adjusted for known confounders was used to identify factors independently associated with ROSC.Results:1936 patients were included in the analysis. 215 (11.1%) patients were ventilated with CPV. 638 (32.9%) of OHCA victims were female and median age was 70 years (IQR 59–80). 565 (29.2%) of patients presented with a shockable rhythm and median no flow duration was 5 min (IQR1-11). Ventilation with CPV during CPR was associated, in a multivariable adjusted analysis, with an increase in the proportion of ROSC OR 1.52 (1.12–2.07);p= 0.007 (Table 1).Conclusions:In our retrospective analysis of non-traumatic Belgian OHCA, ventilation with the CPV mode was associated with higher chances of return of spontaneous circulation.Table 1 (abstract P232).

Mechanical chest compression results in different pressures in different thoracic structures and these pressures are dependent on piston location during compression. We modeled the impact of these pressure measurements on chest compression generated blood flow using a recently developed lumped parameter computational model.Methods:In a porcine VF model of cardiac arrest (n = 3), pressures in the aorta (AoP), esophagus (EsoP), right atrium (RAP), and left ventricle (LVP), as well as carotid and jugular flows, were measured during mechanical compressions (2 inch, 100 compressions per minute), targeting the left ventricle (LV) or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Compression location alternated every 2 min for 6 min. Pressures averaged over four consecutive compressions were used as inputs into the model. During thoracic pump (TP) simulations, the AoP waveform was applied to all elements in the thorax. During modified thoracic pump model (MTP) simulations, the RAP was applied to the right atrium and right ventricle, the EsoP was applied to the pulmonary vasculature, and the LVP was applied to the left atrium, left ventricle and the systemic arteries.Results: Table 1 shows the comparison between measured and modeled blood flows for compressions in both locations. The TP simulation appears a better model of LV compressions. The MTP simulation seems a better approximation of jugular blood flow in the LVOT compressions, but the TP model is a better approximation of the carotid blood flow.Conclusions:The observation that a single pressure (TP Model) applied to all structures was a better approximation of experimental blood flows is surprising given the observed pressure differences during chest compressions in the animal model. There remains much to learn about chest compression generated blood flow.Table 1 (abstract P233).

ICU-CA was defined as a first episode of CPR and/or defibrillation following an ICU admission, as recorded in the Swedish Intensive Care Registry or the Swedish Registry of CPR. Annual adjusted ICU-CA incidence trends (all admissions) were estimated using propensity score-weighted analysis. Six-month mortality trends (first admissions) were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Analyses were adjusted for pre-admission characteristics (sex, age, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare utilization), admission year, and illness severity on ICU admission.Results:We included 231,427 adult ICU admissions. Crude ICU-CA incidence was 16.1/1000 admissions, with no significant annual trend on propensity score-weighted analysis. Among 186,530 first admissions, crude 6-month mortality in ICU-CA patients was 74.7% (95% CI 70.1–78.9) in 2011 and 68.8% (95% CI 64.4–73.0) in 2017. When controlling for multiple potential confounders, the adjusted 6-month mortality odds of ICU-CA patients decreased with 6% per year (95% CI 2–10) (Fig. 1). Patients admitted after out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest had the highest ICU-CA incidence (136.1/1000) and subsequent 6-month mortality (76.0% [95% CI 73.6–78.4]).Conclusions:In our nationwide Swedish cohort, the adjusted incidence of ICU-CA remained unchanged between 2011 and 2017.

Intestinal injury reflects the severity of IR damage, and may be a prognostic marker of poor neurological outcomes and prognosis.Methods:In a randomized, prospective Prague OHCA study, we compared an invasive strategy (intra-arrest transport, ECPR) with standard on-site CPR in refractory cardiac arrest. The assessment of ischemia–reperfusion injury was based on clinical symptoms (profuse watery diarrhoea, higher nasogastric tube waste) in the early phase after CPR. We compared the incidence of intestinal damage in both study arms and its association with patients' neurological outcomes. We hypothesized that intestinal IR injury is more common in patients with refractory CA treated with ECPR (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation). We assumed that the manifestation of the gut injury was associated with a worse prognosis.Results:Intestinal damage was found in 14 of 132 patients, compared to 47 of 124 patients in the standard and invasive arms, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p= 0.003). The adverse neurological outcome was observed in 39 out of 47 patients with IR injury in invasive arm and in 11 out of 14 patients in standard arm. The incidence of a poor neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Categories 3–5) and prognosis in patients with IR intestine injury in the invasive arm on day 180 was statistically more significant compared to the standard arm (p= 0.007 vs.p= 0.46).Conclusions:Ischemia–reperfusion intestine injury is observed more often in patients with refractory CA treated with ECPR. In these cases, intestinal injury is a significant adverse prognostic marker of poor neurological outcomes and prognosis.P236Knowledge and barrier of utilization among physicians about targeted temperature management and therapeutic hypothermiaAli Al Bshabshe1, M Jan21King Lhalid University, College of Medicine, Medicine/Critical Care, Abha, Saudi Arabia,2King Lhalid University, College of Medicine, Anesthesia/Critical Care, Abha, Saudi ArabiaCritical Care2023,27(S1): P236Introduction:We aim to evaluate the knowledge about targeted temperature management and therapeutic hypothermia and to get better understand of barriers to utilization among physicians who work with patients post-cardiac arrest [1,2].Methods:An online survey distributed to the physicians working with patients at risk of cardiac arrest namely emergency medicine, internal medicine and critical care physicians at various cities in Saudi Arabia.

Residual effects of anesthesia or sedation may hamper timely detection [1]. This study aims to evaluate the value of intraoperative regional cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) monitoring with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for predicting the occurrence of early perioperative stroke within three days after cardiothoracic surgery.Methods:We performed a retrospective observational cohort study including all consecutive cardiothoracic surgery patients with routinely perioperative ScO2monitoring admitted postoperatively to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Medical Center Groningen between 2008 and 2017. Brain images were studied. Patients with a confirmed stroke in the anterior cerebral circulation were included in the analysis. The cumulative area under the curve (AUC), duration, and the number of ScO2excursions below predefined thresholds (an absolute value of 50% ScO2or a relative reduction of 20% below baseline ScO2) were calculated per hemisphere. The intraoperative ScO2trajectory of hemispheres affected by stroke was compared with non-affected hemispheres using logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between ScO2values and stroke.Results:Of all included 2454 patients, 39 had a confirmed anterior stroke on brain imaging, of which five had a bilateral stroke resulting in 44 affected hemispheres which were compared to 34 non-affected hemispheres.

Anaesthesia and postoperative sedation may obscure clinical symptoms of stroke and thus delay diagnosis and timely intervention [1]. The objective was to assess the value of intraoperative neuromonitoring and blood pressure monitoring for predicting the occurrence of perioperative stroke within three days after cardiothoracic surgery.Methods:We performed a single-centre retrospective observational cohort study at the University Medical Center Groningen. All consecutive patients with cardiothoracic surgery and intraoperative neuromonitoring admitted postoperatively to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between 2008 and 2017 were included. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any stroke within three days post-cardiothoracic surgery. Brain imaging was studied. Areas under the curve (AUC) of intraoperative mean arterial pressure, cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2), and bispectral index (BIS) below predefined thresholds were calculated, and the association with early stroke was tested using logistic regression analyses.Results:Of all 2454 included patients, 58 (2.4%) had a confirmed stroke. In univariate analysis, a larger AUC MAP < 60 mmHg and AUC BIS < 25 were associated with the occurrence of postoperative stroke while ScO2< 50% or > 20% reduction from individual baseline was not (Table 1). After adjustment for MAP, ScO2, duration of surgery, and other relevant baseline characteristics, only AUC BIS < 25 remained independently associated with stroke occurrence.Conclusions:Cumulative BIS below 25 was associated with the occurrence of a perioperative stroke within three days after cardiothoracic surgery.

In this study, we investigated the change in prefrontal oxyhemoglobin oscillation (ΔHbO2,) is associated with the perfusion status before and after revascularization therapy in symptomatic severe extracranial ICA stenosis patients.Methods:We included eight patients with symptomatic severe extracranial ICA stenosis who underwent revascularization therapy such as CEA and CAS between July 2016 and August 2019.

Similar approach has being extended to the automated pupillometry. The aim of this work is to assess the accuracy of sonographic and pupillometry to detect intracranial hypertension.Methods:We prospectively recorded consecutive neurocritically ill patients data with ICP measurements, sonographic variables to calculate ICP with differente methos (nICP, Pulsatility index, optic nerve sheath diameter) and pupillometry, allong with clinically relevant variables. Transcranial Doppler was performed by 2 investigators, which recorded the different methods at the same time, includind ICP, n-CPP (systolic and diastolic flows), MAP, optic nerve sheath diameter and pupillometry.Results:From May to October 2022, we included 13 patients, in whom we recorded 33 measurements of standard ICP, transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter, pupillometry, hemodynamic and clinical variables. The median age of the patients was 53.8 (± 7.35); mostly male patients (female 24.24%). The most frequent diagnosis of the patients who were included was intracranial hemorrhage (51.52%).

We found a statistically significant (p< 0.001) and strong correlation (coef. 0.8954) between ICP and non-invasive ICP (n-ICP) measured by transcranial Doppler (Fig. 1). Most relevant variables in the Kappa index were n-ICP (AUC = 0.09950) and the NPi (AUC = 0.9999).Conclusions:Among neurocritically ill patients with ICP monitoring, the non-invasive assessment of ICP using transcranial Doppler seems to be a reliable and reasonably accurate alternative method.ReferencesRobba C et al.

Combining a pharmacotherapy with enriched environment (EE) housing may be efficient for cognitive recovery. We predicted that chronic NS-1738, an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (α7-nAChR) positive allosteric modulator, will improve sustained attention post-TBI, alone and in combination with EE. Blocking α7-NAChRs with methylycaconitine (MLA) will attenuate the beneficial effects of NS-1738, confirming its mechanism of action.Methods:Adult male rats were trained in the 3-choice serial reaction time task, reaching stable baselines prior to moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham injury. Rats were randomized to NS-1738 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) starting 24 h post-injury and given daily [subacute (7d); chronic (28d)]. The chronic paradigm co-investigated daily EE (6 h/d), and subgroups were also subjected to daily α7-NAChRs blockade via MLA (3 mg/kg). 3-CSRT retest occurred on days 14–24. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) Western blots assessed cholinergic markers [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and α7-nAChR]. Microarray analysis examined serum inflammatory gene expression. Statistical analysis utilized ANOVAs with Newman-Keuls post hoc tests.Results:TBI rats exhibited impaired sustained attention (p< 0.05), which was improved by chronic NS-1738 (p< 0.05), but not by subacute NS-1738 (p> 0.05). NS-1738 + EE rendered an additive effect on lowering omissions and improving inflammatory markers (p< 0.05) including TREM-1 and IL-1 RA. TBI decreased mPFC ChAT and AChE (p< 0.05) with partial restoration by subacute and chronic NS-1738. TBI reduced ChAT + cells in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, effect attenuated by EE, alone or combined with chronic NS-1738 (p< 0.05). TBI groups that received MLA demonstrated a reinstatement of performance deficits, as hypothesized.Conclusions:Our findings suggest enhancing cholinergic transmission after TBI may be beneficial for neurobehavioral recovery.P245Ionized calcium level and neurological outcome of patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injuryK Badarni1, N Harush2, E Andrawus3, H Bahouth3, Y Bar-Lavie3, A Raz3, M Roimi3, D Epstein11Rambam Health Care Campus, Critical Care Division, Haifa, Israel,2Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel,3Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, IsraelCritical Care2023,27(S1): P245Introduction:Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

The primary outcome of this study was a favorable neurological status at discharge, defined by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0–2. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine whether Ca++was an independent predictor of neurological status at discharge.Results:201 patients were included. Hypocalcemia was common among patients with isolated severe TBI (73.1%). Most of the patients had modest hypocalcemia, and only 13 (6.5%) patients had Ca++≤ 1.00 mmol/l. Hypocalcemia was independently associated with higher rates of good neurological status at discharge with an adjusted OR of 3.03 (95% CI 1.11–8.33),p= 0.03.

It is a challenge to perform TEE in traumatic patients due to cervical immobilisation and related injuries. The improper anaesthesia in airway or maxillofacial injuries, cardiac and lung contusion may compromised the airway and ventilation. This study aims to review the usage of topical anaesthetic techniques for TEE in awake trauma patients.Methods:We report a case series of performing topical anaesthesia for TEE insertion in suspected blunt aortic injury patients. The inclusion criteria: non-intubated, > 18 years old, GCS > 13. The exclusion criteria: moderate or severe brain injury, airway obstruction, stridor, suspected oesophageal,cervical and neck injury, oxygen requirement > 5 l/min. The complications during and after were documented. The patients were put on a nasal cannula 3L/min during the procedure. Topical lidocaine spray (10%, 20 puffs max 4 mg/kg) is applied to the pharynx. The flexible endoscopic TEE probe is passed once the patient felt numbness over the throat or loss of gag reflex.

Although ALS is widely accepted as the gold standard, previous studies have found no advantage of ALS over BLS care in adult trauma. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether ALS transport confers a survival advantage over BLS among severely injured children.Methods:A retrospective cohort study of data included in the Israeli National Trauma Registry from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2020 was conducted. All the severely injured children (age < 18 years and injury severity score [ISS] ≥ 16) were included. Patient survival by mode of transport was analyzed using logistic regression.Results:Of 3167 patients included in the study, 65.1% were transported by ALS and 34.9% by BLS. Significantly more patients transported by ALS had ISS ≥ 25 as well as abnormal vital signs at admission. The ALS and BLS cohorts were comparable in age, gender, mechanism of injury, and prehospital time. Children transported by ALS had higher in-hospital mortality (9.2% vs. 0.9%,p< 0.001). Following risk adjustment, patients transported by ALS teams were significantly more likely to die than patients transported by BLS (adjusted OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05–5.41,p= 0.04). Patients with ISS ≥ 50 had comparable mortality rates in both groups (45.9% vs. 55.6%,p= 0.837) (Fig. 1) while patients with GCS < 9 transported by ALS had a higher mortality (25.9% vs. 11.5%,p= 0.019). Admission to a level II trauma center vs. a level I hospital was also associated with increased mortality (adjusted OR 2.78 (95% CI 1.75–4.55,p< 0.001).Conclusions:Among severely injured children, prehospital ALS care was not associated with lower mortality rates relative to BLS measures.

Complete or full REBOA is the standard procedure utilized for a decade. Some studies pointed out that complete occlusion was associated with higher mortality and complications due to the ischemic-reperfusion. Based on animal studies, partial REBOA has been proposed recently as an option that might help with better perfusion. However, there are scarce clinical data on the effect of partial REBOA [1, 2]. Our study aimed to examine the effect of partial REBOA on traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients.Methods:MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library database searches were conducted using MesH terms for partial REBOA and trauma. An additional search of relevant primary literature and review articles was also performed. Both animal and human research were included. A random effects model was used to estimate the mortality rate using Review Manager 5.4.1 software.Results:Of 512 studies, 39 articles were included in this systematic review. Thirty-six articles were conducted in animal models (swine, sheep, and pig). Due to the variety of outcomes and small sample size, the effect of partial REBOA compared to complete REBOA could not be systematically examined. There were 3 clinical studies (191 patients) on the human population. Partial REBOA demonstrated a trend toward lower mortality compared to complete REBOA (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.34–1.21], I2= 0%) (Fig. 1).Conclusions:Partial REBOA might have a potential effect on mortality benefit, however, the recent data did not show significant improvement in survival comparing to complete REBOA.

At least one comorbidity was present in 71% of the patients. Median severity scores were: SAPS II 26 (19–38), SOFA 3 (1–6), ISS 13 (9–22), RTS 8 (6–8) and TRISS 96,75 (81.1–98.6). The most frequent mechanisms of injury were falls (59%) and road traffic accidents (25%). The majority consisted of blunt trauma (88%), 65% of brain trauma and 35% of musculoeskeletal trauma. Trauma Team assessment was started in < 3 min in all cases and median length of stay (LOS) in the ED was 261 min (154–418). Surgical intervention was performed in < 4 h in 56% of surgical brain trauma injuries, in < 6 h in 67% of extremity open fractures and in < 1 h in 6% of a penetrating trauma.

Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) that may complicate PE has high mortality [1]. Prognosis of course and outcome is needed to personalize monitoring and care of SLD patients. We propose that polumorphism of OLR1 gene encoded proinflammatory receptor LOX-1, circulating extracellular DNA (cfDNA) and immune cells ratio may impact prognosis of SLD. The aim of the study was to define whether that candidate biomarkers may stratify the SLD patients according to the risk of unfavorable course/outcome.Methods:Study cohort included 136 patients (29% women) with SLD (PE, lung abscess, pulmonary gangrene). Median age was 54 (IQR, 41–67), median SOFA score was 2 (IQR, 2–4) on admission. CfDNA was isolated from plasma using organic solvents, DNA concentration was determined by SYBR Green. Genotyping ofOLR1 rs11053646 alleles was performed using a PCR and designed allele-specific tetra primers followed by electrophoretic separation of the products. Medians/odds ratio (OR) and Fisher exact test (FET)/Mann–Whitney U test were employed for calculations and statistics, respectively.Results:BPF complicated PE patients less commonly if they carried minor alleleOLR1 rs11053646 encoding 167N variant of LOX-1 molecule (P= 0.003 by FET, n = 134, OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.6–21.1).

Articles regarding clinical indications of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and patients submitted to intensive care were included. Data extraction and the assessment of the risk of bias were performed and the results were divided per indication.Results:A total of eleven studies met all the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). In five studies carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning was analysed. In four studies necrotizing soft tissue infections were analysed, in one study air embolism was reviewed and in one study osteoradionecrosis was reviewed. Mortality and altered mental status were reviewed.Conclusions:There is a correlation between hyperbaric oxygen therapy and reduced mortality in carbon monoxide intoxication, but a higher incidence of delayed neurological sequelae in carbon monoxide intoxication. There is a significant decrease in neurological status in patients with CO intoxications treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but these patients had also a more severe levelof CO poisoning. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has no significant effect on patient survival for patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has no significant association with wound breakdown and flap complications in osteoradionecrosis. Our recommendation would be to further investigate the clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in intensive care patient through multicenter studies.Fig. 1 (abstract P258).

Recent studies have validated a leuko-platelet index (LPI) in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to predict the occurence of ischemic events, heart failure and mortality. We studied the prognostic value of LPI with these side effects.Methods:We conducted an observational prospective single-center study over 1 year including patients admitted to the Emergency Departement (ED) for NSTEMI. The reverse leuko-platelet index (rLPI = 1/(platelet count x leucocyte count) × 108) was calculated for all patients on admission in the ED. A cut-off point of LPI ≤ 24 was used. We studied the association between LPI and the risk of intra-hospital mortality, shook or heart failure and mortality at 6 months (combined end point- CEP). Describe data are presented as the means SDs or as numbers (percentages). ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting CEP.Results:One hundred and eighty five patients were included in our study. The mean age was 63 years old [27–93] with a sex ratio of 1.60. Seventy five patients (41%) had a history of coronary syndrome and 63 (34%) were treated by an anti platelet treatment. The CEP was shown in 72 patients (45%). From those, 55 patients (76%) were treated by an anti platelet treatment and 63 patients had an ILP ≤ 24. The mortality at 6 months was shown in 11 patients (7%). The analytical study showed that the LPI−1was significantly higher in patients with CEP (p= 0.000; OR = 0.769; 95% CI [0.693–0.844]) and every decrease over 24 in LPI was associated with a CEP increase (p= 0.000; OR = 2.52; 95% CI [1.49–4.27]).Conclusions:The LPI appears to be a simply and fast index, whose the lower values identifies patients with NSTEMI at high risk for CEP, in opposition with the results of the studies in the literature.P260Supraventricular tachycardias: the prognostic value of troponin levelW Bahria, S Yamoune, D Hamdi, Y Zouaghi, F Hamdi, F Lazzez, N Nouira.

Early recognition and management are essential in preventing mortality [1]. Whilst AAS is most commonly associated with severe tearing pain, it can also be painless or present with stroke-like neurological symptoms. This wide variety of presentations presents a challenge to emergency physicians when deciding which patients require computerised tomography aortogram (CTA) imaging, especially with already stretched health care services. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS) combined with D-dimer to rule out AAS in the emergency department [2].Methods:This retrospective single centre study looks at 2 years’ worth of patients who received CTA for suspected AAS at a tertiary vascular hospital emergency department. D-dimer result from day of presentation was collected and ADD-RS was calculated retrospectively from electronic patient notes.Results:A total of 190 CTAs were performed, 14 (7.4%) showed a new AAS. Patients with new AAS were significantly older (73.9 vs 61.3 years,p< 0.001), had higher ADD-RS (1.6 vs 1.1,p< 0.05) and higher D-dimer (11,761 vs 1331 ng/ml,p< 0.05). For ruling out AAS, ADD-RS ≤ 1/normal D-dimer had sensitivity of 100.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 73.5–100.0) and specificity of 31.0% (95% CI 22.1–41.0). Negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. In patients with ADD-RS ≤ 2/normal D-dimer sensitivity was 100.0% (95% CI 71.5–100.0) and specificity was 50.6% (95% CI 39.3–61.9). NPV was also 100%. No patient with AAS had a normal D-dimer.Conclusions:Using ADD-RS ≤ 1 or ADD-RS ≤ 2 (depending on availability of CTA) combined with normal D-dimer appears highly sensitive for ruling out AAS.

This study will review the demographics, characteristics and clinical course of patients presenting with acute organophosphate toxicity to an emergency department in Johannesburg, South Africa.Methods:A retrospective chart review of all patients treated for possible acute organophosphate toxicity from January 2020 to August 2021.Results:One hundred and thirty-four patients were included in the study. The median age was 26 years with a male predominance (male = 56%, female = 44%) (Fig. 1). 109 patients (81.3%) survived, 18 patients (13.4%) demised and the outcome of 7 patients (5.2%) was unknown. The median hospital length of stay was 8 days, (IQR = 5–13), the longest hospital stay was 37 days in ICU. Atropinisation dose was significantly higher for intubated patients (median = 140.0 mg, IQR = 90–219.5 mg) compared to patients who were not intubated (median = 60 mg; IQR = 20.5–120 mg;p< 0.05). The length of stay was significantly higher for intubated patients (median = 11 days; IQR = 7–15) (p< 0.00) compared to patients who were not intubated (median = 5 days; IQR = 3–8,p< 0.00). There was a moderate positive correlation between atropinisation dose and length of stay (correlation coefficient = 0.37,p< 0.00). There was a moderate negative correlation between atropinisation dose and cholinesterase level (correlation coefficient = − 0.39,p< 0.00). Of those reported to have adverse effects 78.6% were related to atropine toxicity.Conclusions:Our study shows a high mortality rate secondary to organophosphate exposure. Significant exposures and thus higher doses of atropine were associated with increased length of stay and need for intubation. We found a high incidence of atropine related adverse effects. More studies are needed to further establish the balance between the therapeutic and adverse effects of high dose atropine as a treatment modality for organophosphate toxicity.Fig. 1 (abstract P262).

Our main objective was to determine the prevalence of CCB overdose at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital adult ICU, management strategies and the patient outcomes.Methods:We performed a retrospective observational study (2020–2021). Ethical approval was obtained through the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).Results:We admitted 1317 patients to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during the study period. Demographic and organ dysfunction/support are provided in Table 1. The prevalence of toxin ingestion admissions was 14% (180/1317), 95% confidence interval (CI) 13–15%. CCB overdose accounted for 5%,CI 3–7%, (9/128) of toxin ingestion admissions. After correction of volume status, the frequency of interventions utilised were vasopressors (78%), HIE therapy (67%), calcium (44%), methylene blue (11%) and hemoperfusion (44%). Maximum vasopressor dose was achieved in the first 8 h while lactate levels peaked after 8 h from admission. The median duration of ventilation, vasopressor use, length of ICU stay were 6 days (CI 0–7), 5 days (CI 4–6), and 9 days (CI 6–11), respectively. Patients receiving hemoperfusion had a trend to lower duration of ventilation (2 fewer days), vasopressor days (1.5 fewer days), and ICU LOS (1.5 fewer days). ICU Mortality was 33% for the group and 25% for those undergoing hemoperfusion.Conclusions:Calcium channel blocker overdose is a significant healthcare burden with a high mortality.

Three patients (4%) died; all other patients made a full recovery. Twenty-three patients (31%) were admitted to the ICU because of a threatened airway due to trismus, of whom 14 (61%) were intubated. One patient developed aspiration pneumonia and in one patient, clinical course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute liver injury (ALI). The median ICU length of stay was 9 h (IQR 7–13). The second most common reason of ICU admission was hyponatremia (n = 15, 20%), of whom 11 (73%) were treated with hypertonic saline. Median sodium correction after 8 h was 13 mmol/L (IQR 7–15). One patient died due to brain edema. Lastly, 8 patients (11%) presented with hyperthermia, of whom 7 patients (88%) received cooling therapy. All displayed secondary complications, such as rhabdomyolysis, AKI, ALI and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The median length of stay was 41 h (IQR 11–123).

Doctors from three emergency departments from London were contacted for participation.Results:38 ED doctors completed the survey which included 14 questions to assess accessibility to ophthalmoscope and slit lamps, as well as measuring confidence in managing ophthalmic emergencies in A&E. 81% of participants were senior house officers versus 9% who were registrars and the remaining 10% were consultants. 76% of participants had not had any formal training on ophthalmic emergencies in A&E departments. Despite having accessible ophthalmoscope and slit lamp in their departments, only 53% and 19% felt confident using these devices respectively. Only 11% felt confident enough in dealing with ophthalmic emergencies, whilst 50% felt a little confident, and 39% felt not confident at all.Conclusions:Emergency department doctors lack confidence in diagnosing and managing eye related emergencies, as well as using ophthalmic equipment. This can be linked to a lack of formal training. This study emphasises the importance of providing more education and training on ophthalmological equipment and common ocular emergencies.ReferenceSim PY et al.

Obtaining results from a Clauss assay, the most used laboratory fibrinogen assay, can take up to 60 min; too long in emergency situations. Alternative assays are often costly and time-consuming too. In this study we used turbidity and thrombin generation curves as inputs for a mathematical model of fibrin polymerization to derive the fibrinogen levels in diagnostically challenging patients.Methods:We simultaneously measured the turbidity and thrombin generation in 44 frozen plasma samples, including 29 samples with a PT > 13 s (n = 24), with an anti-Xa > 0 U/ml (n = 14), and/or with a D-dimer > 500 ng/ml (n = 4). From these 29 samples, 8 did not produce an analysable turbidity and/or thrombin generation curve. The model derived fibrinogen levels of the remaining 36 samples were then compared to the fibrinogen levels measured with the Clauss assay (ranging between 1.1 and 16.6 g/l).Results:The one sample with a very high Clauss fibrinogen level of 16.1 g/l could not accurately be determined using our method. Comparison of the predicted and Clauss fibrinogen levels in the other samples resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.92 (Fig. 1).Conclusions:This feasibility study shows that our method can determine the fibrinogen concentration very well.

Therefore, we consider this method promising as a fast fibrinogen assay for application in time-critical situations.Fig. 1 (abstract P270).

The protease ADAMTS13 regulates Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimere size and thereby platelet adhesion to the vascular wall. The specificity of ADAMTS13 for VWF is self-regulated by CUB domains resulting in a closed conformational state. Degradation of its CUB domains by plasmin during hyperfibrinolysis could increase ADAMTS13 activity and result in decreased substrate specificity. Here, we propose a novel mechanism of trauma-induced hyperfibrinolysis. We hypothesise that ADAMTS13 can circulate in an ‘open’ conformation after trauma (= without CUB domains) which is associated with increased ADAMTS13 activity and the presence of hyperfibrinolysis. Additionally, we hypothesise that forcing an open conformation of ADAMTS13 in vitro decreases its specificity for VWF and hence increases tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced fibrinolysis.Methods:In 38 trauma patients with a base deficit of > 5 mM, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) Fibtem and ADAMTS13 activity and conformation were determined. Additionally, 11 blood samples of healthy volunteers were incubated with either an ADAMTS13 opening antibody (17G2) or an inhibiting antibody (3H9) and ROTEM Fibtem was performed in the presence of tPA.Results:Trauma patients had an open ADAMTS13 conformational state in 21% of cases, which was defined as a conformation index > 0.5 (Fig. 1A). An open ADAMTS13 was associated with increased ADAMTS13 activity (B) and hyperfibrinolysis in ROTEM Fibtem (C). An open conformation of ADAMTS13 accelerated tPA-induced fibrinolysis in vitro (D-F).Conclusions:ADAMTS13 can circulate in an ‘open’ and hyperactive conformational state in severely injured trauma patients, which is associated with hyperfibrinolysis. This was confirmed in vitro, where inducing an open conformation of ADAMTS13 accelerated hyperfibrinolysis.Fig. 1 (abstract P271).AADAMTS13 conformation index > 0.5 is"

Our earlier results showed that fibrinolysis could be detected in more patients and earlier with ECA-test. Our presumption was that this could be attributed to the absence of calcium in the ECA-test, resulting reduce activation of FXIII and TAFI. On the other hand, thrombin generation (TG) is crutial in the formation of the fibrin mesh. The aim of the further analysis was to assess if the kinetics of ecarin-activated TG show any difference when compared to the tissue factor or elagic acid-induced TG, and if this could contribute to distinct sensitivity to fibrinolysis of the ECA-test.Methods:From 25 adult liver transplant recipients blood samples were collected in 5 pre-defined time-points during surgery (n = 125). ClotPro’s IN-test, EX-test, and ECA-test were performed simultaneously from each sample. Hyperfibrinolysis was defined as maximal lysis > 15%. The maximal velocity (MaxV) of TG and AUC, indicative of the total amount of generated thrombin, were calculated from the first derivate of the viscoelastic curve. Independent samples t-test, Kruskal–Wallis test with Bonferroni correction were used to compare these parameters between EX-test and IN-test vs ECA-test in lysis and non-lysis groups.Results:The AUC was significantly lower in the lysis groups of all tests (EX-testp= 0.02; IN-testp= 0.009; ECA-testp= 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference could be detected in terms of MaxV and AUC when TG capability was assessed within the groups with hyperfibrinolysis (MaxV EX vs ECAp= 0.774; IN vs ECAp= 0.105; AUC EX vs ECA and IN vs ECAp= 1).Conclusions:Within the groups showing hyperfibrinolysis, no significant difference could be detected between TG and AUC. These results failed to indicate altered thrombin generation in the ecarin-induced test, which infers that distinct sensitivity to fibrinolysis of the ECA-test cannot be attributed to features of thrombin generation.P273Comparison of coagulation parameters associated with fibrinogen concentrate and"

This analysis focussed on seven patients on cryo who developed thromboembolic events (TEEs).Methods:FORMA-05 was a prospective, randomised, controlled Phase 2 study. Patients undergoing PMP surgery with predicted blood loss ≥ 2 L received HFC (4 g) or cryo (2 pools of 5 units), repeated as needed. Plasma coagulation factor levels, EXTEM A20, FIBTEM A20 and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) were measured perioperatively.Results:Patients were randomised to receive cryo (N = 23) or HFC (N = 21). Fibrinogen, platelet count, factors XIII and VIII, von Willebrand factor (VWF), EXTEM/FIBTEM A20, and ETP were maintained throughout surgery in both groups. No patients in the HFC group developed TEEs. Two patients in the cryo group developed deep vein thromboses (DVT), and appeared to have a procoagulant status preoperatively, with higher fibrinogen level (Fig. 1A), FIBTEM A20, and platelet levels which persisted perioperatively. The five patients on cryo who developed pulmonary embolism (PE) showed a disproportionate increase in VWF levels intraoperatively (post-cryo administration) which was retained postoperatively (Fig. 1B).Conclusions:Patients treated with HFC versus cryo showed broad overlaps in coagulation parameters; however, patients who developed PE experienced a disproportionate rise in VWF following cryo administration, while patients who developed DVT displayed a procoagulant status before and following surgery. Preoperative testing may allow identification of these patients and thus minimise risk of TEEs.Fig. 1 (abstract P273).

Adult patients with a risk factor for DIC (severe infection, trauma, malignancy, obstetric complication or pancreatitis) and a thrombocytopenia < 150 × 109/L were eligible for inclusion. ROTEM profiles of the EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tracings of clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), clot amplitude at 5 min (CA5), maximal clot firmness (MCF) and maximum lysis (ML) were measured once between day 1–4 of ICU stay. A DIC diagnosis was defined as an International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis DIC score of ≥ 5. ROTEM EXTEM parameters with a statistically significant difference between DIC and non-DIC patients were selected for construction of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves with subsequent calculation of the area under the curve (AUC).Results:Of 55 included patients, 15 (27.3%) developed DIC. Compared to non-DIC patients, DIC patients had a statistically significant prolonged EXTEM CT with a concomitant decrease in EXTEM CA5 and EXTEM MCF, EXTEM ML was inhibited in DIC (Table 1). The results of the INTEM and FIBTEM tracings were similar.

The introduction of thromboblastography (TEG) in recent years to the diagnostic arsenal in intensive care units has allowed us to advance in bedside assessment of the coagulation status of our patients. TEG has allowed us to guide resuscitation in bleeding patients by providing the necessary data to dispense with other more subjective interpretations.Methods:A prospective observational study was performed. During a 4-month period, measurements were taken in 40 postoperative patients scheduled for cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery and neurosurgery. The TEG 6sc thromboelastograph (Haemonetics®) was used to analyze the samples. Blood samples were obtained within the first half hour of admission. Subsequently, clinical and analytical follow-up was performed over the following 48 h to detect the appearance of possible significant bleeding episodes. Significant bleeding was defined as: anemization > 2 g/dL of hemoglobin in less than 6 h, or bleeding episodes requiring red cell concentrate transfusion or initiation of support with vasoactive drugs.Results:Of the 40 cases studied, 55% (22/40) were men and the incidence of bleeding was 10% (4/40). Thromboelastographic data were recorded for the \"bleeding\" and \"non-bleeding\" groups (summarized in Table 1) and the data were subsequently analyzed with nonparametricU-Mann–Whitney tests without finding statistically significant differences between the two groups.Conclusions:The results obtained suggest that TEG in our study follows the trend already published in many other studies in which the high negative predictive value in relation to bleeding stands out. However, the size of the sample, the heterogeneity of the groups and the fact that we did not consider hemostasis-modifying drugs prior to admission are very important limitations of this analysis.Table 1 (abstract P281).

VET technology has been useful in areas where conventional tests are inadequate, such as screening for HyperC, thrombotic risk assessment and systemic anticoagulants’ effect. We aim to characterize the evolution profile of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 infection during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay.Methods:Consecutive recruitment of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital’s ICU, during a 6 months period. Patients with thrombosis in the previous 3 months, pregnancy, under hormone therapy, and congenital coagulopathies were excluded. VET were executed every 5 days, at discharge and in complications and all of them were under low weight molecular heparin (LMWH) therapy. Group 1 (G1), n = 24—less than 10 days in ICU and group 2 (G2), n = 16—more than 10 days in ICU. In G1 there was 1 death (day 3) and in G2 there were 5 deaths (between days 15 and 42). We focused current analysis on VET- Rotem® parameters (see Fig. 1).Results:Prognostic scores APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA were higher in G2, but surprisingly G1 patients are more obese. G2 patients had shorter aPTT and lower platelets. The variables CT_HepTem and MCF_Extem-MCF_Fib_Tem present a greater difference between groups, but no statistical significance. We observed an initial correlation between basophils number (which is lower) on CT Intem and CT HepTem, lost as progression to cure, probably due to cytoplasm heparin granules. As expected, VET were in accordance with HyperC: short CTs, increased MCFs, and decreased lysis.Conclusions:We expected to guide/adjust LMWH dosage, using Rotem® profiles, however these were not corrected by LMWH, used transversally, and remained unchanged in all patients during their stay in ICU.Fig. 1 (abstract P282).

The CoLab-score includes the patient’s age and ten blood parameters, reflecting the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated the CoLab-score over time in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients at the ICU. We hypothesized that the CoLab-score will decrease over time, independent of survival, disease severity and pandemic periods. This would create the opportunity to monitor COVID-19 patients and potentially ruling out the need for isolation when the host response decreases and the infection is overcome.Methods:We used serial data of the Maastricht Intensive Care Covid (MaastrICCht) cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients to investigate the association between time and daily CoLab-score using linear-mixed models. Crude models were adjusted for sex, APACHE II score, SOFA score, and stratified for intensive care mortality.Results:324 patients (73% men), aged 64 ± 12 years with 5959 daily CoLab-scores, were included. CoLab-score decreased with 0.31 points per day (95% CI − 0.33 to − 0.28). Adjustment for sex, APACHE II and stratification for mortality did not change this result.Conclusions:The CoLab-score decreased over time in mechanically ventilated ICU COVID-19 patients, with a point reduction per three days. This suggests that the CoLab-score eventually decreases to a normal state, reflecting a host response that has overcome infection. Future investigation is warranted to assess whether the need for isolation can be ruled out based on the CoLab-score.ReferencesArjen-Kars B et al. BMJ Open 2022;12:e059111.Leers MPG et al.

This increased risk can be partly explained by ICU specific coagulopathy through inflammation induced by sepsis and other causes. We hypothesize that the increased incidence of VTE could be partly explained by insufficient dosing of LMWH to antagonize this coagulopathy with associated low anti-Xa levels. The primary aim of this retrospective study is to describe the anti-Xa levels in critically ill patients treated with different LMWH doses. Secondary aim is to provide data on the percentage of patients in target of anti-Xa levels with (guideline) dose therapy.Methods:Study design: A retrospective non-randomized study to evaluate the effect of prophylactic nadroparin dose on anti-Xa levels in a mixed medical-surgical population.Study population: Patients ≥ 18 years with an ICU stay > 48 h who received at least three subcutaneous injections of nadroparin and for whom at least one anti-Xa measurement was available.Measurements: Age, gender, ICU length of stay, admission diagnosis, nadroparin doses and dose adjustments, anti-Xa levels, haemoglobin, platelet count, APTT, PT, APACHE III score, SAPS score.Results:344 patients were included. Median age was 66 years, and 34% of all patients were female. Median length of ICU stay was 10 days. In hospital mortality was 21%. Nadroparin 2850 IE daily was given 1257 times in 158 patients. Nadroparin 5700 IE daily was given 811 times in 149 patients. Median anti-Xa levels after nadroparin 2850 IE/day were 0.1 U/L (IQR 0.1–0.2 U/l), compared to 0.3 U/l (IQR 0.2–0.4 U/l) after nadroparin 5700 IE/day. Nadroparin 2850 IE/day led to adequate prophylactic anti-Xa levels in 39% of measurements, compared to 83% with nadroparin 5700 IE/day.Conclusions:Nadroparin 5700 IE/day leads to more adequate prophylactic anti-Xa levels compared to 2850 IE/day in critically ill patients.P285Anti-Xa guided twice daily enhanced anticoagulation for severe COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit setting: outcomes, incidence of pulmonary embolism and complicationsRE Elsheikh1, GB Dani Benvenutti2, AP Pambouka2, LK Kenny2, LO Orlando2, NG Ganatra2, SA Audet2, AD Dushianthan2, RC COVID-19 Investigators21Southampton General Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Southampton, UK,2Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UKCritical Care2023,27(S1): P285Introduction:Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and morbidity [1].

Inflammatory cytokines, most importantly IL-6, play a role in this pathogenesis. Given that both anemia and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are associated with adverse outcomes, and iron is ineffective, novel treatments of anemia are wanted. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of immunosuppressive agents on anemia development and RBC transfusions in critically ill COVID patients.Methods:This retrospective cohort study included all ICU patients of two hospitals in the Netherlands between February 2020 and April 2022 with a PCR-positive COVID-19 ARDS. Actively bleeding patients were excluded. Evolving insights in the treatment protocol resulted in three treatment groups: no treatment, steroids or combination of steroids with tocilizumab. Daily lab results and number of RBC transfusion were retrieved and the decline in Hb level between ICU admission day 1 and 7 was calculated. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to compare outcomes.Results:In total, 719 patients were included, of which 168 in the no-treatment group, 337 in the steroid group and 212 in the steroids and tocilizumab group.

The number of RBC transfusions was 1 [1–3] in the group receiving combination therapy, 3[1–6] in the group receiving steroids and 3[2–8] in the group receiving no treatment (p< 0.002). In a multivariate analysis, the receipt of combination therapy remained associated with inhibition of decline in Hb as well as with lowering the number of RBC transfusions.Conclusions:Treatment with either steroids or a combination of steroids and tocilizumab was associated with a slower decline in Hb levels during ICU stay and less RBC transfusions when compared to no treatment.P287Secondary immunodeficiency in septic hematological patientsM Barbosa, ME Batista, M Ferraz, S Cardoso, J Casimiro, T Duarte, N GermanoCentro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central, Unidade de Cuidados Intensivos Polivalente- Hospital Curry Cabral, Lisboa, PortugalCritical Care2023,27(S1): P287Introduction:Secondary immunodeficiency is defined as an impairment of the immune system caused by extrinsic factors, such as acquired infections, drugs and hematological malignancies. Understanding the immunodeficiency in the latter group is crucial to the management of one of the most serious complications: sepsis.Methods:Retrospective observational study of 82 patients with hematologic malignancies who were admitted with sepsis to a polyvalent ICU between January 2016 and November 2022. We recorded baseline characteristics, organ failure scores and outcome. We hypothesized that cytopenia of any lineage would increase the risk for a poorer prognosis and it may help identify those who may benefit the most from early ICU admission.Results:The median age was 63 years in this group. The most common hematologic malignancies were acute myeloid leukemia (47%), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (19%) and multiple myeloma (17%). Median SOFA score at admission was 8 (IQR 7–11), APACHE II was 17 (IQR 12.23) and SAPS II was 61 (IQR 49–77) with an estimated mortality of 30% and 66%, respectively. Median ICU stay was 8 days and time till hospital discharge was 7 days. At admission 21.6% had anemia. Leucopenia was found in 56.8%, neutropenia in 58.8%, and lymphopenia and monocytopenia was found in 81.1% and 86.5%, respectively.

Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity are recognised complications of CAR T therapy which may require critical care support. As indications for CAR T-cell therapy grow, this may create a resource pressure for critical care.Methods:We performed a service evaluation of all CAR T admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) from June 2019 to May 2022. The objectives were to describe the resource requirements and outcomes of these patients admitted to ICU and compare them with those who did not require ICU care.Results:69 patients were treated at MRI over 35 months with 23 patients (33.3%) requiring critical care admission. Of these 23 patients, 3 (13%) required renal replacement therapy, 2 (9%) required non-invasive ventilation, 2 (9%) required intubation and 6(26%) required vasopressor support. The median length of stay on ICU for patients was 4 days. 60% of ICU patients survived 6 months, versus 74% for non-ICU patients.Conclusions:Our findings highlight that rates of critical care admission following CAR T treatment have reduced at our centre as the maturity of our programme has grown. In addition, we have observed that most patients admitted to ICU did not require level 2 or level 3 care. This has implications for critical care capacity planning in new CAR T centres. It also highlights that there is a need for better stratification of patients into those who truly need an ICU bed for level 2 or level 3 care and those who may be better served by enhanced monitoring in a ward-based environment.P289Hematologic patients in ICU—where do we stand?ME Batista, M Barbosa, M Ferraz, J Casimiro, S Cardoso, T Duarte, N GermanoCentro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central, Unidade Cuidados Intensivos Polivalente—Hospital Curry Cabral, Lisboa, PortugalCritical Care2023,27(S1): P289Introduction:Hematologic patients have a poor prognosis in intensive care, leading to strict admission policy.

Due to sarcopenia and malnutrition, sCr overestimates GFR among intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. The use of cystatin C (cysC), an eGFR marker which is independent from race and muscle mass, improves accuracy. Among ICU survivors, we investigated the implications of the removal of race coefficient from eGFR calculation and the discrepancy between sCr- and cysC-based eGFR.Methods:Among 30,919 ICU survivors admitted at 4 hospitals from 2 US institutions (Montefiore, Bronx; and Beth Israel Deaconess, Boston), eGFR was calculated at discharge using sCr-based equations with and without race coefficient (eGFRsCr+RCand eGFRsCr-RC). In a subset of patients with available cysC between ICU admission and 1-year follow-up, eGFRsCr+RCand eGFRsCr-RCwere compared with cysC-based eGFR (eGFRcysC).Results:eGFRsCr-RCwas higher than eGFRsCr+RCby a median of 4 ml/min/1.73"

Removal of race coefficient differentially impacted the 2 institutions based on the degree of diversity in the racial composition (Fig. 1). CysC was available in 51 patients with a total of 108 measurements. eGFRcysC was lower than eGFRsCr-RCand eGFRsCr+RCby a median of 16 and 21 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, resulting in a reclassification towards worse eGFR stage in more than 50% of the total measurements.Conclusions:In a cohort of ICU survivors, the removal of race coefficient results in lower eGFR among Black patients, but appears to contribute to the overestimation of GFR among Non-Black patients. CysC may improve accuracy and reduce racial disparities in the identification of kidney dysfunction, but remains underutilized during ICU admission and the subsequent follow-up.Fig. 1 (abstract P292).

This study aims to investigate whether daily measurement of urinary and plasma renal biomarkers have a role in earlier predicting COVID-19 associated AKI.Methods:The study was conducted as a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study between August 2020 and December 2020 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 65 moderate and severe COVID-19 positive adult (≥ 18 years) patients were enrolled for this study. We measured serum creatinine, cystatin C, NGAL, KIM-1, Urine-Klotho, TIMP-2, IL-6 level, and urinary microalbumin/urinary creatinine on various days. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to find the sensitivity and specificity of various markers to predict the incidence of AKI.Results:A total of 24 moderate and 41 severe COVID-19 patients were included. Out of which 47 patients developed (72.3%) acute kidney injury (AKI) over the course of COVID-19. Among these subjects, 18/47 (38.2%) developed severe AKI (KDIGO 2 + 3), and 5/47 (10.6%) required RRT. NGAL was found to be the best marker to predict the probability of AKI (Area under curve AUC of 0.713–0.786) with a sensitivity of 76–90% and specificity of 56–79% on different days of assessment from Day 1 to Day 7.

However, the association of persistent AKI and outcome is not well characterized in solid organ transplant patients. The aims of this study are (1) to determine the occurrence of pAKI and the association between pAKI and clinical outcomes and (2) to identify the risk factors for developing persistent AKI among heart, lung or liver transplant recipients.Methods:We performed a systematic review of the literature including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. We included human prospective and retrospective cohort and randomized clinical studies that involved recipients of heart, lung, and/or liver transplant during the index hospitalization, and reported on the rates of occurrence of pAKI, and outcomes including graft failure and mortality.Results:We identified 8789 records, of which 3228 were selected for abstract review. Ten studies were selected for full text review and included in final analysis. One study reported 152 episodes of pAKI (54.5%) in 279 patients receiving 301 liver grafts. pAKI was associated with graft loss in 25% compared to 8.7% in patients without pAKI. Three studies reported occurrence of pAKI of 32.4–49.2% in 821 lung transplant recipients. Risk factors reported were body mass index, nephrotoxic agents, and hypotension. pAKI was associated with all-cause mortality with a HR varying substantially between 1.77 and 14.69. No studies investigating pAKI in heart transplant patients were found.Conclusions:Persistent AKI is a common complication in non-renal solid organ transplant recipients and is associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Through regulation of signaling inflammatory pathways, small RNA nucleotides—microRNAs (miRNAs) can be involved in sepsis and associated organ dysfunction. The aims of this study were to track the 7-days time course of serum miRNAs in patients with sepsis treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, or a non-nephrotoxic antibiotic and miRNA associations with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipokalin (NGAL), creatinine, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, and acute kidney injury (AKI) stage [1].Methods:Prospective open clinical study included 46 adult septic patients, 7 on vancomycin, 20 on gentamicin, and 19 on another antibiotic treatment. Blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 of treatment, and circulating miRNAs were identified using quantitative reverse transcription PCR during the study.Results:Four circulating miRNAs have been identified. We found no relationship between miRNA and biochemical variables on day 1. By day 7 of gentamicin treatment,miR-15a-5pprovided good discrimination between AKI and non-AKI (area under curve, 0.828).

However, no specific treatment options are available. As an amino acid, glutamine serves multiple purposes in the human body, including reactive oxygen species scavenging and elimination. This trial assesses the effect of glutamine on renal damage biomarkers in cardiac surgery patients at risk for AKI.Methods:64 high risk patients were identified by high postoperative urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels and received either body weight adapted glutamine or saline-control for 12 h intravenously. The primary outcome was the change in urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels after 12 h of administration. Secondary outcomes included the change in KIM-1 and NGAL, overall AKI rates, free days of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medication, renal replacement therapy, mortality, length of ICU/hospital stay, and major adverse kidney events at day 90.Results:Patients received coronary artery bypass graft surgery (32/64), valve surgery (18/64), a combination of both (6/64), or other procedures (8/64).

We aimed to evaluate the impact of its use in clinical practice.Methods:A single-center, prospective, observational study of critically ill patients with stage 2 or 3 AKI by KDIGO criteria on ICU admission was performed. CCL-14 was measured on fresh urine within 48 h of admission and 48 h afterwards using the NEPHROCLEAR TM CCL14 Test (Astute Medical ®). Patients with stage 5D chronic kidney disease; expected length of stay in ICU < 48 h; renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the week prior to ICU admission; and patients with a clinical decision to start RRT prior to study inclusion, were excluded.

Patients with transitory AKI, had a first CCL14 median value of 1.2 and second of 1.05. When asked, 2.6% and 7.7% of clinicians answered RRT should be started; 23.1% and 30.8% believed RRT would be needed in the next 48/72 h; 71.8% and 66.6% thought drugs dose should be adjusted, before and after knowing the CCL14 value respectively. 20% changed their fluidtherapy goal after knowing CCL14 value.Conclusions:CCL-14 may be useful for clinical practice decisions and future studies are needed to evaluate its use on hard outcomes.ReferencesCoelho S et al.

We aimed to evaluate urinary chemokine C–C ligand 14 (CCL14) as a valid biomarker to predict persistent severe acute kidney injury.Methods:A single-center, prospective, observational study of critically ill patients with stage 2 or 3 AKI by KDIGO criteria on ICU admission was performed. CCL-14 was measured on fresh urine within 48 h of admission and 48 h afterwards using the NEPHROCLEAR TM CCL14 Test (Astute Medical ®). Patients with stage 5D CKD; expected length of stay in ICU < 48 h; renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the week prior to ICU admission; and patients with a clinical decision to start RRT prior to study inclusion, were excluded.Results:Thirty-nine patients were included. Of these, 18 patients had an initial CCL14 value of less than 1.3 ng/ml, 19 with a value ≥ 1.3 to < 13 ng/ml, and two patients with dosages greater than 13 ng/ml. In 67% of cases there was no change in the value range in both assessments. 23% (n = 9) developed persistent acute kidney injury, the vast majority with stage 3 AKI on admission. CCL14 was significantly higher in end point positive at enrollement (7.34 ng/ml vs 1.22 ng/ml). CCL14 dosing higher than 1.3 ng/mL was associated with an increased risk of developing persistent AKI, odds ratio (OR) 2 (95% CI 0.4–9.5). High CCL14 values are also associated with the need for RRT in the first 5 days. 7 patients required RRT, with a median CCL14 value of 7.34 ng/ml; OR 2.6 (95% CI 0.4–15.8).Conclusions:Elevated CCL14 values correlate with the development of persistent severe acute kidney injury. These data may lead to a paradigm shift in the approach of these patients.P304Donor lactate levels at hospital admission can help predict renal graft outcomes in kidney donation after Maastricht II circulatory deathAC Gaspar1, M Gama2, G Nobre de Jesus1, J Oliveira3, M Neves3, A Santana3, JM Ribeiro11Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, EPE, Intensive Care Department, ECMO Referral Center, Lisbon, Portugal,2Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, EPE, Transplant Coordination Department, Lisbon, Portugal,3Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, EPE, Nephrology and Transplantation Department, Lisbon, PortugalCritical Care2023,27(S1): P304Introduction:In recent years, lactate levels have been associated with neurological outcomes in patients undergoing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).

Data was collected from electronic files of donors and recipients. Regarding the donors, warm ischemia time and lactate levels were gathered. Regarding the recipients, immediate graft function and creatinine at 1 month follow-up were analyzed. For statistical analysis we used SPSS® software.Results:From 2017 until May 2022, twenty-one effective donors were identified in our ECPR/uDCCD program. Thirty-one grafts were transplanted. Mean age of donors was 46.7 years and 16 were male. Time from cardiac arrest to hospital admission was 15 ± 8 min, mean lactate level at admission was 21.4 ± 0.5 mmol/l. Regarding immediate graft outcomes, 29% (n = 9) had immediate graft function, 61.3% (n = 19) had delayed graft function (defined as need for dialysis in the first week after transplant) and 9.7% (n = 3) had primary non-function. Using ROC testing, we identified that a lactate value of 19.9 mmol/l at admission had a 100% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity to estimate primary graft non-function. We also detected a correlation between higher lactate values at admission and recipient creatinine at one-month follow-up (p= 0.000).Conclusions:In our study, lactate level of potential donors at hospital admission was correlated with the risk for primary graft non-function after kidney transplantation after uDCCD. Lactate level of donors can also affect other outcomes, which needs to be confirmed with a larger series and prospective studies.P305Protective effects of pentoxifylline on renal microcirculatory oxygenation and perfusion in sepsis-induced AKI in ratsB Ergin1, H.R Taal2, I Reiss2, C Ince11Erasmus Medical Center, The Department of Intensive Care, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2Erasmus Medical Center, The Department of Neonatology, Rotterdam, NetherlandsCritical Care2023,27(S1): P305Introduction:Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains one of the most frequent conditions associated with high mortality rate amongst septic patients in the ICU. In this study we hypothesized that the microcirculatory targeting therapy using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, pentoxifylline (PTX), may have a potential beneficial effect to improve renal microcirculatory perfusion and oxygenation thereby ameliorate the development of AKI.Methods:In this study, 35 fully instrumented, mechanically ventilated, anesthetized Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups as sham, LPS group, LPS + PTX group, LPS + resuscitation with Ringer’s acetate (RA) group and LPS + PTX + RA group. Sepsis was induced by i.v. injection of 10 mg/kg LPS until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) reached below 60 mmHg followed by 3 h resuscitation or/and 60 mg/kg PTX infusion.

Perioperative AKI is an important contributor to morbidity and prolonged hospital stay [1]. In addition, individuals with AKI are nine times more likely to develop CKD, a progressive and life-threatening disease [2]. Despite this, there is limited literature of the incidence of perioperative AKI & correlation with progression to CKD.Methods:A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using patients identified from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database over a 2-year period within a single London hospital setting. 253 patients were identified.

Furthermore, it is a common reason for initiating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Early identification of patients requiring CRRT could help physicians to focus on preventing progression to CRRT, improve planning and possibly even patient outcomes. Here, we developed a CRRT prediction algorithm that uses patient data available within the first 12 h of admission to predict initiation of CRRT within the first five days of admission.Methods:All adult patients with AKI stage 1–3 and sepsis (Sepsis-3 criteria) on their first ICU stay were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database (Boston, MA, USA [2]). Baseline characteristics including demographics, vital signs, and laboratory measurements from the first 12 h of admission were extracted. Initiation of CRRT within 12–120 h after admission was the outcome. We built a predictive logistic regression model using 70% of the cohort and evaluated model performance in a 30% validation data subset. We performed majority class undersampling to address class imbalance.Results:We included a total of 12,683 patients into our final cohort. 5% received CRRT in the study period.

We propose a structured data-driven methodology and develop a model to predict the use of renal replacement therapy for patients on respiratory support with Covid-19 in 126 ICUs from 42 Brazilian hospitals.Methods:Adult ICU patients (March 2020–December 2021) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and need of ventilatory support at D1 admission in the ICU. Main outcome was the need of RRT. We estimated 3 prediction models: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and XGB Boosting. Models were derived in the training set and evaluated in the test set following an 80/20 split ratio, and models' parameters were selected using fivefold cross-validation. We evaluated and selected the best model in terms of discrimination (AUC) and calibration (Brier’s Score). Variable importance was estimated for each predictor variable.Results:13,575 ICU patients with need of respiratory support, of which 1828 (14%) needed RRT. ICU and hospital mortality were respectively 15.7%, 20.3% (non-RRT) and 54.3%, 69% (RRT). Mean age was 63.9 and 55.3 years (RRT vs non-RRT). Mean ICU LOS was 27.8 vs. 12 days, in RRT vs non-RRT. RF and XGB models both showed higher discrimination performance compared to LR (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.81–0.85] and 0.83 [0.80–0.85] vs 0.78 [0.75–0.80]). RF and XGB models"

Other markers of kidney function such as serum creatinine are distorted during RRT and therefore not utilizable. Proenkephalin A 119–159 (penKid) has been described as a novel biomarker to assess kidney function even during non-stable state, such as critical illness or sepsis. Therefore, we hypothesized that penKid may be a competent biomarker to assess recovering kidney function during ongoing continuous RRT.Methods:This post-hoc analysis included 210 critically ill adult patients with AKI from the randomized ELAIN trial. PenKid levels were measured in the blood of these patients. Competing risk time-to-event analysis were performed for penKid at initiation of RRT and in a landmark analysis at day 3 after RRT initiation. Competing risk endpoints were successful liberation from RRT or death without prior liberation from RRT.Results:Manufacturer cut-off of 89 pmol/l confirmed by optimal cut-off analysis. Low penKid levels (≤ 89 pmol/l) at RRT initiation were associated with early and successful liberation from RRT compared to patients with high penKid levels (Fig. 1a), estimated 28d-cumulative incidence function (CIF) of successful RRT liberation 61% vs. 45%,p= 0.022). This association persisted in the landmark analysis on day 3 of RRT (Fig.1b, 28d CIF of successful liberation from RRT 67% vs. 47%,p= 0.018).

The current analysis focused on mortality in patients with documented SOFA scores.Methods:In this third analysis [1], all patients enrolled until August 31, 2020, were assessed for eligibility. Patients with documented SOFA scores immediately before the first ADVOS session were included. Demographic characteristics, treatment settings, adverse events, and the SOFA Score-standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were analyzed. For the latter, patients were divided according to their SOFA score, and the expected mortality [2] was compared to the observed hospital and 28-day mortality.Results:202 patients from 5 German clinics were included. 67% were male, with a median age of 58 years. 89% received vasopressors, 73% were on mechanical ventilation and 52% had acidosis. The median SOFA Score was 15 (IQR 12, 18) and 91% had multiple organ failure. 739 ADVOS sessions were prescribed with a median of 3 (IQR: 2, 5) per patient and a duration of 19 h (IQR: 12, 23) at low blood flows (100 ml/min (IQR: 100, 150)). Less than 5% of the sessions were aborted due to device-related problems. Only 2% of the adverse events (e.g., clotting) were attributed to the ADVOS multi by the users.

Multi-system organ failure or direct kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) which subsequently increases the need for RRT and may affect the outcomes.Methods:This is a retrospective observational study of 338 critically ill patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICU of a tertiary center in Portugal, between March 2020 and December 2021. Clinical, analytical and baseline patient characteristics were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to correlate patient data with the need for RRT and ICU mortality.Results:From a total of 338 patients, 5% required RRT (n = 16), 25% of which received intermittent hemodialysis (n = 4) and 87,5% continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (n = 14). Baseline characteristics are described in Table 1. In our sample, 61 patients (18%) presented with acute AKI, from whom 14 (23%) were submitted to RRT. From all the patients receiving RRT, 10 (62.5%) did not have pre-existing chronic kidney disease. In the logistic regression analysis, AKI (OR 45.4; 95% CI 7.7–269.5;p< 0.001), higher SOFA (OR 1.24; 95% CI 103–1.51;p= 0,03), creatinine (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.4–3.0;p< 0.001) and C-reactive protein (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02–1.16;p= 0,01) on admission were associated with the need for RRT. Additionally, ICU mortality associated with RRT was 75% compared to 28.3% in the group not submitted to RRT (OR 7.6; 2.4–24.2;p= 0.001).Conclusions:The need for RRT in critically ill COVID-19 patients is associated with an increased mortality rate in our study. We were also able to identify AKI, higher SOFA, creatinine and C-reactive protein at admission as risk factors for RRT. However, due to the retrospective nature of our analysis and our small sample size, more studies on this topic are needed to confirm these results.Table 1 (abstract P311).

Central venous catheters (CVC) are often used in intensive care patients for drug infusion. If a patient receives CRRT, a second central dialysis catheter (CDC) is required. Where to insert CVCs is directed by guidelines but there are no recommendation how to place multiple catheters [1]. If a drug is infused in a CVC with the tip close to the CDC, it could be aspirated into the dialysis machine and by that, increasing the risk of elevated drug clearance [2]. This phenomenon of direct aspiration has been described in vitro,in case studies and in one experimental study [2–4]. If there is a difference in clearance, when CVC and CDC tips are at different positions is less described.Methods:In this experimental model with 18 pigs, gentamicin (GM) and vancomycin (VM) were infused through a CVC, during CRRT. Clearance was measured when the tip of the CVC was 2 cm caudally of the tip of the CDC, at the same level and at 2 and 4 cm cranially of the tip of the CDC. Position was controlled by chest radiography. Serum and dialysate concentrations were sampled after 20 min of CRRT at each position. Clearance was calculated. Repeated measure ANOVA was performed, level of significance was set top< 0.05.Results:When GM and VM were infused through a CVC the distances between the CVC and CDC tips affected clearance of GM (F = 2,91,p= 0.05) and VM (F = 2.98,p= 0.04), during CRRT (see Fig. 1). Clearance was higher when infusion was in a CVC tip cranially to the CDC tip.Conclusions:The distance between CVC and CDC tips can affect drug clearance, during CRRT.ReferencesFrykholm P et al.

This study analises the correlation between p(v−a)CO2and lactate values during liver transplantation.Methods:A correlation analysis between lactate and p(v−a)CO2was conducted at the different stages of liver transplantation at Ramon y Cajal Hospital. The Shapiro–Wilk normality test was used to rule out normal distribution. Spearman’s correlation between lactate and p(v−a)CO2was assessed.pvalue < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.Results:Perioperative data of 98 patients were collected. Lactate median at baseline was 1.2 mmol/l (IQR 0.6) and p(v−a)CO2median 4 mmHg (IQR 5). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was r = 0.25 (p= 0.03). Lactate median in anhepatic phase was 4 mmol/l (IQR 1,1) and p(v−a)CO2median 4 mm Hg (IQR 4.8). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was r = −0.1 (p= 0.2). Lactate median in neohepatic phase was 3.1 mmol/l (IQR 1.3) and p(v−a)CO2median 3 mmHg (IQR 5). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was r = −0.1 (p= 0.07). Lactate median at ICU admision was 2.25 mmol/l (IQR 2.2) and p(v−a)CO2median 4 mmHg (IQR 4). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was r = −0.01 (p= 0.9). Lactate median 24 h after liver transplantation was 1.2 mmol/l (IQR 1.1) and p(v−a)CO2median 4 mmHg (IQR 3). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was r = −0.1 (p= 0.4).Conclusions:We only found correlation between lactate and p(v−a)CO2in baseline measurements before surgery. There was no correlation during the other phases of liver transplantation which leads us to think maybe p(v−a)CO2could be a better indicator of microcirculatory state and tisular perfusion in these patients, since lactate clearance is dependent on liver function.P314Gastroesophageal reflux disease and its health-related quality of life among adult ICU survivorsS Wali, M Gurjar, S Gutte, S Mohindra, B Poddar, A Azim, V Kapoor, P MishraSanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Critical Care"

Within hours of critical illness, 90% of commensal organisms are lost, increasing morbidity and mortality. Probiotic supplementation failed to ameliorate dysbiosis in this population. Fermented foods have been shown to increase microbiome diversity and decrease inflammatory markers. This study investigated the safety and feasibility of administering kefir (a fermented milk beverage containing multiple cultures of commensal bacteria) as the first step to using fermented foods to mitigate dysbiosis in the critically ill.Methods:We conducted an open-label phase I safety and feasibility investigation of kefir given in escalating doses to adult critically ill patients with intact gastrointestinal tracts, starting with 60 ml, then 120 ml 12 h later, followed by 240 ml daily.

We aimed to assess microbiome diversity and composition, with regards to 28-day mortality and secondary infections in sepsis.Methods:This is a secondary analysis of the INCLASS randomized trial (NCT03345992), evaluating the efficacy of clarithromycin treatment in patients with sepsis-associated respiratory distress and other organ dysfunctions [2]. Rectal microbiome was assessed for all patients on day 1, after DNA extraction and16Sgene—based sequencing on Oxford Nanopore MinION followed by EPI2ME analysis (ONT/Metrichore Ltd). All two-tailed, Bonferroni-corrected,pvalues < 0.05 were considered significant.Results:After quality assessment, 102 samples were included in the analysis. Biodiversity, assessed by Shannon and Simpson indexes, was significantly reduced among patients who died (p= 0.003 andp= 0.005), but greater among those with sepsis resolution (v= 0.010 andv= 0.018, respectively). The Shannon Index was an independent risk factor for mortality [OR 0.497; 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 0.286–0.864;p= 0.013], after adjustment for sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson comorbidity index, and type of initial infection. Survivors displayed greater abundance inActinobacteria(p= 0.00205) andBacteroidetes(p= 0.01745) than non-survivors; distribution ofProteobacteria(p= 0.39299) andFirmicutes(p= 0.29353) did not differ (Fig. 1). Higher abundance inActinobacteriawas less likely associated with primary bacteremia during follow-up (p= 0.03264).Conclusions:Gut dysbiosis is associated with 28-day mortality in sepsis, independently of severity scores. Higher abundance inActinobacteriamay be protective, possibly due to decreased bacterial translocation related to overgrowth of other phyla. Targeted interventions may improve sepsis outcome.ReferencesAdelman MW et al. Crit Care. 2020;24:278.Karakike E et al. Crit Care. 2022;26:183.Fig. 1 (abstract P318).

However, it is largely unknown whether this also applies to systemic immune responses, especially in humans. If so, profiling the gut microbiota may aid precision medicine approaches in critically ill patients.Methods:The fecal microbiota composition of 108 healthy participants was determined using 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. Immunological phenotypes were determined using (1) an ex vivo challenge model in which monocytes were stimulated with various inflammatory compounds, and (2) an in vivo challenge model of systemic inflammation and immunological tolerance induced by repeated intravenous administration of 1 ng/kg body weightE. coliendotoxin. This model captures hallmarks of both the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotypes of sepsis.Results:Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the gut microbiota composition was associated with sex, but not with age, BMI, or diet (Fig. 1a). Significant associations were observed between the microbiota composition and ex vivo monocytic cytokine responses induced by several stimuli, although the explained variance was relatively low (0.3–4.8%, Fig. 1b). A number of pairwise correlations betweenBlautia, BacteroidesandPrevotellagenera and cytokine production induced by these stimuli were identified (Fig. 1c). No significant relationships between microbiota composition and in vivo cytokine responses or tolerance were found (explained variance ranging from 0.4 to 1.3%, Fig. 1d,e).Conclusions:Although the gut microbiota composition does explain some of the variance in ex vivo cytokine responses, its predictive value is limited. Furthermore, the gut microbiota composition is neither associated with in vivo systemic immune responses to endotoxin in humans, nor with immunological tolerance. Therefore, our findings do not support considering the gut microbiota composition for precision medicine approaches targeting the immune system in critically ill patients.Fig. 1 (abstract P319).AExplained variance calculated using redundancy analysis (RDA) for non-immune-related covariates.BExplained variance calculated using redundancy analysis (RDA) for ex vivo"

Current severity scores do not assess gastrointestinal (GI) tract function. We aimed to determine the association between GI tract function on the days preceding presumed infection with the clinical outcome.Methods:A retrospective cohort study including all the adult patients admitted to the 18 beds general ICU in an academic tertiary medical center between January 2013 and December 2020. We included patients with suspected infection after at least 72-h from ICU admission. Patients with a colostomy, ileostomy, or a rectal tube were excluded. The main exposures were the number of bowel movements (BM) and consecutive days without BMs during the preceding 72-h. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess for possible confounders including factors associate with GI tract motility, antibiotics, length of stay, APACHE II, and SOFA scores.Results:The cohort included 1306 patients. The median age was 56.2 years (IQR 39.469.1); 1004 (70.0%) were male. At the time of suspected infection, 1139 (79.4%) were treated with antibiotics, and the median SOFA score was 5.0 (IQR 3.0–7.0). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 364 (25.4%). Patients who had 0–2, 3–5, and > 5 BMs during the 72-h preceding the suspected infection had mortality rates of 20.3%, 28.0%, and 34.3% (p< 0.001) (Fig. 1). Patients who had > 2 BMs had an adjusted OR of 1.55 (95% CI 1.13–2.1,p= 0.005) for mortality. Every additional consecutive day without BM before the suspected infectious event was associated with an adjusted OR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.73–0.95,p< 0.02) for mortality.Conclusions:In patients suspected to have sepsis, a higher frequency of BMs during the preceding 72-h, is associated with increased mortality.

Thus, our study aimed to determine the accuracy of more convenient methods by the pH strip test (pHS) and pH liquid test (pHL), compared to the standard pH meter (pHM) in measuring gastric pH values in critically ill patients.Methods:A prospective observational study was conducted on patients who were admitted to medical ICUs of the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University (MedCMU), Chiang Mai, Thailand, between June and July 2022. Gastric samples were measured by pHM, pHS, and pHL techniques and interpreted by four independent raters. The reliability of pHS and pHL readings reported by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.93 (0.90, 0.96) and 0.94 (0.90, 0.96), respectively.Results:A total of 113 gastric samples were collected from 27 ICU patients, which were 71 (IQR 56, 81) year-old, male 48% (13/27 cases), sepsis/septic shock 67% (18/27 cases), SOFA score 5 (IQR 2.9), and serum lactate 3.7 (IQR 2.2, 5.6) mmol/l. The pH values measured from pHM, pHS, and pHL were 5.83 (IQR 5.12, 6.61), 5.50 (IQR 4.88, 6.00), and 5.75 (IQR 5.25, 6.38), respectively,p< 0.01. The pH value from the pHS method was slightly lower than the pHM, with a difference of −0.25 (−0.54, 0.03),p< 0.001. While the pH value from pHL was slightly higher than the pHM, with a difference of 0.02 (−0.36, 0.53),p= 0.04. The accuracy of pH measurement from pHS had a good correlation with pHM, with Spearman’s correlation (rho) of 0.91 (0.86 to 0.96) and the linear regression equation Y = 0.95 X + 0.56 (Fig. 1A (abstract P321)). On the other hand, there was an optimal correlation between pHL and pHM, with rho = 0.75 (0.60 –0.89) and the equation Y = 1.09 X −0.72 (Fig. 1B).Conclusions:The use of the pHS has a better correlation with the standard pHM measurement than the pHL.

Male and female residents and citizens (≥ 18 years) who tested positive for COVID-19 upon ICU admission and who were ready for discharge were included. The ‘MUST’ malnutrition screening was performed to identify patients at high risk of malnutrition who required ONS and other treatments.Results:The present study included two hundred patients where male participants constituted 68% compared to females (32%). The included population was neither acutely ill nor had nutritional intake for more than 5 days. 45% of COVID-19 patients experienced a reduced dietary intake at hospital, and 58% lost weight during ICU/hospital stays. About 25% received enteral nutrition in the ICU, whereas (2%) required ongoing homecare nutritional support after hospital discharge. Almost 80% were advised to follow up with a dietitian and 96% were provided additional dietary counseling.

In the critically ill patients in ICU, mortality is still a challenge, particularly for elderly patients with functional decline. The relationship between mortality in ICU critically ill patients and sarcopenia is inconsistent throughout literature, impeding our ability to quantify the magnitude of the problem. Our primary objective is to evaluate the role of sarcopenia in the mortality of the critically ill patients in ICU through a systematic review.Methods:This systematic review was conducted using the Cochrane, Embase and PubMed databases to examine the studies available for the association between sarcopenia and mortality in the critically ill patients.Results:Overall, eleven retrospective cohort studies totalling 2029 patients, all aged 65 years of age and older, were included in our review with the primary outcome of all studies being mortality. As far as the methods of skeletal muscle measurement using Computerized Tomography (CT) are concerned, six studies used skeletal muscle index (SMI) (n = 832), three studies used skeletal muscle area (SMA) (n = 711) and two studies used total psoas muscle area (TPA) (n = 486).

Effective intervention programmes such as early mobilization and high protein diet can help reduce the mortality risk and provide beneficial outcomes.P325The association of sarcopenia defined by a simpler screening tool and long-term outcomesT Yuyen, C Thanakiattiwibun, O ChaiwatDepartment of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Department of Anesthesiology, Bangkok, ThailandCritical Care2023,27(S1): P325Introduction:Sarcopenia and frailty are common in older adult patients and associated with poor postoperative outcomes. Low muscle mass and function are main indicators of sarcopenia. The simpler screening tool without muscle mass measurement, C3 formula, demonstrated high predictive power for diagnosing sarcopenia [1]. The aim of this study was to identify the association of sarcopenia defined by C3 formula and long-term outcomes in older adult cancer patients undergoing surgery.Methods:Cancerous surgical patients aged older than 60 years were enrolled. The sarcopenia was defined by C3 formula, consisted of low muscle strength and/or abnormal physical performance, plus malnutrition/risk of malnutrition. The muscle strength was measured by handgrip-strength. The physical performance was assessed by the 6-m usual gait speed walk test. Nutritional status was evaluated by the Mini Nutritional Assessment–Short Form (MNA-SF). After sarcopenia screening, the long-term outcomes were collected including the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores, any infections in the hospital, length of hospital stay, and mortality at 3 months and 1 year.Results:251 patients were enrolled. 130 patients were sarcopenic defined by C3 formula. Sarcopenic patients had greater number of moderate to severe disability (ADL score ≤ 70) at 3 months after hospital discharge (19.5% vs 5.2%,P= 0.001) and higher mortality rate at 1 year after sarcopenia screening (29.5% vs 14.9%,P= 0.006). There were no differences regarding the infection rate, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality rate. The independent risk factors for one year mortality were distant organ metastasis (HR: 3.99, 95% CI 2.25–7.07) and sarcopenia defined by C3 formula (HR: 1.78, 95% CI 1.01–3.15).Conclusions:Sarcopenia defined by a simpler screening tool was associated with higher moderate to severe disability at 3 months after discharge and increased mortality rate at 1 year after screening.ReferenceChaiwat O et al.

We aimed to redefine the evidence regarding the effectiveness and timing of early EN using a systematic review that focused on critically ill patients with sepsis.Methods:We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP databases on February 23, 2022. Our systematic review included studies published after 2004 that compared outcomes of early EN with those of delayed EN in critically ill patients with sepsis aged ≥ 18 years. Two authors independently reviewed the title, abstract, and full text and selected relevant studies according to the inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted patient information and reports on effectiveness, adverse effects, and clinical outcomes.Results:Ten studies were included, and the sample size was 31–2410. The pooled risk ratio of mortality obtained using three randomized controlled trials was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85–1.24; I2= 3.15%,p= 0.26), which was not significant. The pooled mean difference of length of stay in the intensive care unit obtained using two randomized controlled trials was -1.52 days (95% CI − 3.18 to 0.15; I2= 47.62%,p= 0.17), which was not significant. The pooled risk ratio of intestinal ischemia obtained using two randomized controlled trials was 3.53 (95% CI 1.36–9.15; I2= 0.00%,p= 0.53); this was significantly predominant for early EN. Other outcome measurement indices and adverse effect reports had mixed results.Conclusions:Early EN intervention did not significantly improve intensive care unit-related mortality but increased intestinal ischemia risks in critically ill patients with sepsis. Heterogeneous characteristics and outcome measurements should be improved for a tailored approach to early EN in critically ill patients with sepsis.P327Early initiation of fluid intake (sipping) after extubation versus current recommendation, effect of feeling of thirstV Nigrovičová, Š Sedláčková, M DurilaUniversity Hospital in Motol, Department of Anaesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care medicine, 2nd Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague 5, Czech RepublicCritical Care2023,27(S1): P327Introduction:Safe extubation is only possible if the patient is conscious and cooperative, able to cough, swallow and has preserved protective reflexes of the respiratory and swallowing tract.

The aim of study was to investigate the incidence of thirst and occurrence of complications between patients receiving sipping immediately after extubation and patients who did not drink any fluid within 2 h after extubation.Methods:In randomized study we assigned 40 patients after short intubation and who were extubated within 48 h. We defined 2 groups with 20 patients in every group. 1st group—early initiation of oral fluid intake in a form of sipping within 2 h, with maximal amount of water 100 ml per hour. 2nd group—oral fluid intake postponed up to 2 h after extubation. Exclusion criteria: patients after upper digestive tract surgery, trachea surgery and with possible neurological deficiency. At defined time points (0, 60 and 120 min after extubation) we evaluated thirst and occurrence of complications (nausea, vomiting, aspiration) between both groups.Results:Despite the fact we did not find a significant difference in the feeling of thirst at time points—p> 0.05 (probably because of low number of patients, but tendency is obvious), we found, that in the 1st group where patients received sipping, we saw a significant thirst relief in every time point—0, 60, 120 min after extubation—p= 0.0009, 0.0088 and 0.0003. There were no differences in occurrence of complications between both groups.Conclusions:The study shows that early initiation of fluid intake after extubation, in a form of sipping, seems to be beneficial and safe for patients and decreases incidence of thirst after extubation without any complications.P328Amino acids effect on muscle and gut functionality in critically ill patients: a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trialR Bounab1, N Heming1, R Carlier2, H Prigent3, V Maxime1, B Guenoud4, M Hartweg4, C Roessle4, D Breuille4, D Annane11Raymond Poincaré hospital, critical care unit, Garches, France,2Raymond Poincaré hospital, Medical Imaging, Garches, France,3Raymond Poincaré hospital, Department of Physiology, Garches, France,4Société de Produits Nestlé, Nestlé Health Science, Lausanne, SwitzerlandCritical Care2023,27(S1): P328Introduction:A fraction of critically ill patients require prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays [1].

This study aimed to examine the impact of proning on providing nutritional therapy for mechanically ventilated COVID-19-patients by comparing the achievement of nutritional goals and possible complications in patients who were proned vs. those who were not.Methods:This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. We included all adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from 01/03/2020 until 31/05/2020 who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), excluding those referred for ECMO.

In order to manage this physical sequela of critical illness, a specific approach has been adopted: physical rehabilitation. In the ICU, rehabilitation is used to reverse muscle catabolism, reduce the effects of immobility and improve physical functioning. Our main outcome is to investigate the effect of physical rehabilitation in ICU specifically on the outcomes of patients, the dose–response profile and the impact it has on task-specific training.Methods:We conducted a systematic review using the Ovid Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases to explore the current studies available on physical rehabilitation in the ICU. We included all randomized controlled trials which investigated physical rehabilitation in the ICU in adults. Physical function, muscle strength, hospital and ICU stays, health-related quality of life and mortality comprised our outcomes.Results:We included sixty-five trials, with a total of 5658 participants. Results showed that physical rehabilitation decreased hospital length stay by 1.77 days (mean difference, 1.77 d: 95% CI 3.05–0.48 d), ICU length of stay by 0.7 days (mean difference, 0.70 d: 95% CI 1.39 TO 0.25 d) and physical function at the hospital discharge has been improved (mean difference, 0.24; 95% CI0.00–0.46).

Patients were classified into two groups: eRHB or not eRHB. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and a telephone survey was conducted one year after D/C. Clinical Frailty Scale at ICU admission (T1) and one year after D/C (T5); Medical Research Council (MRC) at the start of rehabilitation (T2) and hospital D/C (T4); Barthel Index at ICU D/C (T3), T4 and T5; and the SF-36 health questionnaire at T5 were also collected. Statistical analysis was performed between subgroups: Pearson's Chi-square test or Mann–WhitneyUtest to find significant differences. ART-ANOVA was used to analyse the survey results.Results:Of 99 patients, 64.6% belonged to the eRHB group. There were no statistically significant differences in the analysis of clinic-demographic variables. We observed a significant improvement of the MRC, a better Barthel Index in the eRHB group, and a statistically significant positive impact on several components of the SF-36 in the eRHB group (physical functioning, vitality, social functioning, bodily pain, general health, and self-reported health transition).Conclusions:Patients who received eRHB had better physical functioning and higher vitality recovery. In addition, they suffered less impact on their social life, had better pain control, and reported improved general health. All this emphasises the need for eRHB protocols in the ICU, promoting multidisciplinary care of our patients.ReferencesNeedham DM. JAMA 2008;300:1685–1690.Lang JK et al. Crit"

There is data showing that an early start as recommended, i.e., within 72 h after ICU admission or intubation in critically ill patients, is essential for positive effects on ICU LOS [1, 2]. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of early mobilization within 72 h of ICU admission or intubation.Methods:We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of early mobilization within 72 h compared with standard care in terms of ICU length of stay. Here, randomized controlled trials were included from inception to October 8, 2022. Early mobilization was defined, based on Bein et al., as any patient intervention that initiates and/or supports passive or active range of motion exercises and aims to promote and/or maintain range of motion [1].Results:Of a total of 29,680 studies screened, 18 studies with a total of 1833 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the statistical analysis. In the meta-analysis, the random effects model showed a positive effect in ICU LOS in the group after admission in favor of early mobilization compared with standard care (WMD (weighted mean difference): −0.57 days, 95% CI [−1.26, 0.13]; SMD (standardized mean difference): −0.44, 95% CI [−0.82; −0.06]; 16 studies with 1567 patients; see Fig. 1). The effect after intubation proved to be nonsignificant (WMD: −0.65 days, 95% CI [−1.92, 0.63]; SMD: −0.37, 95% CI [−1.11; 0.38]; 2 studies with 266 patients). When all studies were considered together, there was a positive effect in favor of early mobilization compared with standard care with a significant SMD (WMD: −0.58 days, 95% CI [−1.19, 0.03]; SMD: −0.43, 95% CI [−0.78; −0.09]).Conclusions:Early mobilization within 72 h of ICU admission or after intubation had a positive albeit small effect on LOS in the ICU.ReferenceBein T et al.

Long term complications post critical illness, such as post intensive care syndrome (PICS), are well-recognised [1], however, little data exists specific to COVID-19 ICU survivors.Methods:Local ethics committee approval was secured. Participants were recruited using the electronic intensive care chart database. All patients, from March 2020 to November 2021, who survived Covid-19 were included. Researchers conducted phone interviews with participants and completed three questionnaires; Katz Index of Independent Living Questionnaire, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. Data was input and analysed using excel and stored on a password encrypted computer.Results:Database search revealed 61 patients available, 33 of 61 patients were included. 20 (61%) were male, 13 (39%) were female. Mean age was 58, with a range of 25–81. Mean length of ICU stay was 15 days, with a range of 1–74 days. 15 (45%) patients were intubated. Most common Katz score (range 1–6) was the highest score of 6 in 23 (70%) patients. Most common Karnofsky score (range 10–100) was 60 in 11 (33%) patients, with 31 (94%) scoring < 100. The most frequent ATS shortness of breath (SOB) grade (range 0–4) was 3 in 10 (9%) patients, with 23 (70%) patients scoring > 0. 14 (42%) patients had an ongoing cough, 11 (33%) patients had a wheeze and 0 (0%) patients were on home oxygen therapy.Conclusions:This study highlights in the majority of patients who survived severe Covid-19 disease to discharge home, there were serious ongoing limitations to their functional status and exercise tolerance, however, they remained independent of basic activities of daily living.ReferenceRawal G et al.

Our primary aim of this cross-sectional study is to observe the evolution in time of the impact on mental health during as well as after the pandemic.Methods:In this cross-sectional study the mental health of our ICU nursing staff (n = 18) was monitored over a period of 26 months by using validate questionnaires for anxiety, depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) score, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia severity index (ISI) and the revised version of the Impact of Event Severity scale (IES-r). In total it entailed 4 surveys during the pandemic and one follow up survey 6 months after.Results:Regarding GAD7 and ISI, ICU nurses did not score significantly at the beginning nor the end of this study. IES scores started off at 18 which is just below significant but 35% had a score associated with developing PTSD. These scores remained relatively high throughout the pandemic but saw a mean downward trend at the end (p= 0.338). Mean PHQ-9 scores were initially at the level of “minimal depression” and rose to be classified as “mild depression” at the end of the pandemic. In the follow-up survey scores dropped back to “minimal depression”. In time, the PHQ-9 test was not withheld as significant (p= 0.298).Conclusions:It is evident that the results presented in our study show that ICU nurses are prone to developing mental health problems during times of increased workload and stress and in particular the development of PTSD remained high in some subjects. Although there was a slight decrease in our follow-up survey, we believe mental health should be closely followed upon in the future.P339Potential benefits of automated infusion relay: survey of its possibilities from the material waste and cost perspectiveE Meijer1, M Onrust1, W Dieperink1, F Doesburg2, W Bult3, M Nijsten41UMC Groningen, Dpt of Critical Care, Groningen, Netherlands,2UMC Groningen, Dpt of Medical Technology, Groningen, Netherlands,3UMC Groningen, Dpt of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Groningen, Netherlands,4UMC Groningen, ICU, Groningen, NetherlandsCritical Care2023,27(S1): P339Introduction:Manipulations with continuous syringe infusions in the ICU are time-consuming and cost-intensive. Nurses often have to exchange syringes at preplanned times, but pre-emptive swapping of syringes may result in considerable unused residual volume, and thus additional waste. During vasopressor infusion, automated infusion relay is usually considered for ensuring a smooth switching between syringe pumps. However, infusion relay also allows the optimal use of drug solutions and could present an opportunity to reduce environmental footprint and lower costs. Consequently, we studied the magnitude of unused drug disposal in our ICU in a context of manual syringe exchange, to evaluate the potential benefit of an automated infusion relay function.Methods:We performed a"

All patients, except strictly isolated patients (e.g. with COVID-19, MRSA or ESBL) were included. All 50 ml syringes that were disposed of before or after use were separately collected per patient and the constituent solution and the remaining volume were recorded. Medication costs, as used internally in our hospital, were identified for the 20 most commonly used drugs or solutions.Results:A total of 2667 syringes from 105 subsequent adult ICU patients were collected and analyzed (Fig. 1). Expired medication or discontinuation of medication accounted for disposal of 179 (7%) completely filled syringes. The 2488 remaining syringes had a mean ± SD residual volume of 12 ± 13 ml (24%). This remaining medication volume had an associated cost of € 5736 or 28% of total cost of fully filled syringes, or at least €100,000 on an annual basis.Conclusions:In our ICU approximately a quarter of syringe solutions are discarded during syringe switching. In terms of waste production, associated nursing time and associated material costs, more efficient syringe exchanges with automated infusion relay may address these three concerns.Fig. 1 (abstract P339). Frequency distributionP340Identifying barriers to a robust second check of medicationV Milic, L Cameron, C JonesSt Thomas Hospital, Pharmacy, London, UKCritical Care2023,27(S1): P340Introduction:Medication errors are common in critically ill patients with a reported average of 1.7 medical errors each day [1]. Critically ill patients are at increased risk of medication error and patient harm, due to complex medication regimens with frequent changes, organ dysfunction increasing potential for harm from medication errors, and greater use of intravenous medications are associated with increased errors. Many hospitals have policies mandating an independent second check for high risk medication administration such as intravenous drugs or Controlled Drugs, with the intention of improving safety by identifying and preventing errors reaching the patient. This second checking process has a significant time implications and the efficacy for error prevention is debated with adherence to second checking being documented between 52 and 72% within literature [2, 3]. The aim of this study was to determine the barriers for a robust independent second check of medication within adult critical care.Methods:Four focus groups were conducted with critical care nurses at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify potential barriers to implementing an effective second check.

One way to reduce the risk of DRPs is the presence of a hospital pharmacist in the ICU. Since Belgian healthcare is organized differently and the presence of a hospital pharmacist in ICU teams is not well established, a study was conducted to implement clinical pharmacy services.Methods:A prospective non-controlled interventional six-week study was conducted in a 31-bed intensive care unit in az groeninge Kortrijk, Belgium. The hospital pharmacist was involved in the evaluation of the medication chart of the patient, attending medical rounds, and answering drug-related questions. Clinical interventions were presented to physicians. The acceptance rate was measured, and potential risk factors associated with the acceptance rate were identified.Results:A total of 204 DRPs were detected. Physicians accepted 158 interventions, resulting in an acceptance rate of 77.5%. Statistical analysis showed that the acceptance rate was significantly associated with the type of proposed intervention. The intervention to change a drug and to pause or stop a drug was implemented more frequently.Conclusions:Providing patient care to critically ill patients by a multidisciplinary team is an emphasis of the modern day ICU because the team approach is invaluable. Through proactive participation in evaluating the appropriateness of the medication chart, identifying and reporting DRPs, and proposing evidence-based interventions, the pharmacist contributed to the multidisciplinary team in the ICU.

Based on different literature resources, the prevalence of ADR-related hospital admissions ranges from 0.2 to 54.5% [1]. The costs of an ADR have been reported to be substantial with an additional $6000–$9000 for each event [2]. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, probability, and severity of ADRs and ADR-related costs in patients admitted to the ICU.Methods:This prospective consecutive study was carried out in the ICU of Kaunas Hospital of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences from September 2021 to November 2022. Adult patients admitted to the ICU because of an ADR were included. The probability of suspected ADRs was evaluated using the Naranjo Scale. The severity of ADRs was assessed by the Modified Hartwig and Siegel Scale.Results:A total of 768 patients were admitted to the ICU during a 15-month period. Of them, 43 (5.6%) admissions were related to ADRs. The mean age of patients admitted due to ADRs was 76.7 years (SD 13.8; range, 33–97). Most of the suspected ADRs (74.5%) were classified as probable; 16.3%, as definite; and 9.3%, as possible. The majority (93%) of ADRs were categorized as severe (of them, 32.5% resulting in death) and the remaining ADRs were moderate. The most commonly reported ADR was bleeding (53.5%) followed by hyponatremia and bradycardia (each 14%), diarrhea (11.6%) and other such as coma, pulmonary edema, etc. (7%). The costs per event ranged from €502 to €11,280. Health care expenditures attributed to ADR-related admissions to the ICU totaled more than €172,000.Conclusions:Our study showed that the overwhelming majority of ADRs were severe and one-third of them led to a fatal outcome. This warrants future studies on preventability and solutions how to reduce the costs of ADR-related ICU admissions.ReferencesAngamo MT et al. Drug Saf 2016;39:847–57.Kane-Gill SL et al.

Drug preparation may be delegated to doctors of varying experience, causing potential error or delay. We instituted dedicated ERD preparation stations containing drugs, equipment and a quick-reference table. As per European guidance [2], we introduced pre-filled syringes of drugs that would otherwise need dilution, to avoid miscalculation and extra steps.Methods:Efficiency and safety in ERD preparation was assessed pre- and post-intervention. Doctors were surveyed regarding knowledge and confidence levels. Two subsets of 10 doctors completed a practical task pre- and post- intervention to record the time taken to prepare a full set of ERDs. They were each given a drug reference table to mitigate prior knowledge as an influencing variable. Participants completed feedback to identify equipment and process factors that they felt caused delays or risk of error.Results:20 pre- and 11 post-intervention survey responses were collected. 91% of responders felt that the new stations had improved safety and efficiency. There was a 61% increase (p= 0.003) in awareness of drug locations post-intervention. In the practical assessments, the average time taken to prepare a full set of drugs decreased from 20 to 7 min pre- to post-intervention (p= 0.00009).Conclusions:Dedicated drug preparation stations have improved efficiency and drug location knowledge. The stations will be extended to other trust ICUs, where we aim to re-audit with a larger sample.

Physicians in ICU often describe patients as “frail” in reference to their pre-morbid condition and possibly their chances of recovery following ICU admission. Several validated scores to assess frailty have been developed, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and the Modified Frailty Index (MFI). These scores correlate well with post-operative and post-ICU mortality [1–3]. Nonetheless, in our clinical experience, ICU physicians more often opt to use their clinical judgement, or “eyeball assessment”, to estimate the degree of frailty.Methods:A retrospective study of patients admitted to a single center ICU in a large academic medical center in Tel Aviv during March and April 2019. Physician-perceived frailty, as reported on admission on an ordinal scale of no frailty, mild, moderate, or severe frailty, was compared with results of validated scores such as CFS and MFI calculated retrospectively from patient records.Results:100 consecutive patients were included; 60 [60%] were male, mean age 58 ± 18 years.

Adult patients anticipated to stay for ≥ 48 h were included. Exposure of interest was frailty as defined by the Clinical Frailty Scale (> 5) and the primary outcome was ICU mortality. Additional outcomes were in-hospital mortality, receipt of invasive or non-invasive ventilation or kidney replacement therapy, stage 2/3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and length of ICU stay. Categorical outcomes were compared using Chi-square and continuous outcomes using Mann–Whitney test. For analyses of ICU and hospital mortality, we employed generalized linear models; associations are reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results:838 patients were included.

The aim was also to evaluate to what degree patients hospitalized for sepsis seek medical attention prior to hospitalization.Methods:This was a retrospective case–control study with data validated through clinical chart review. A disproportionate stratified sampling model was used to include a relatively larger number of sepsis hospitalizations. All eight public hospitals in region Scania, Sweden were included (January 1 to December 31, 2019). 447 patients hospitalized for sepsis (cases), and 541 patients hospitalized for other causes (control) were identified through clinical chart review. Logistic regression was used to analyze healthcare the week prior to hospitalization, and cox regression was used to analyze death and readmission the year after discharge.Results:48% of patients that survived a sepsis hospitalization were readmitted the year after discharge, compared to 39% for non-sepsis patients (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.03–2.19),p= 0.04 (Fig. 1). 32% of readmissions were caused by infection, and 18% by"

This creates a secure learning environment where mistakes can be made safely [1]. SBE is commonly organized by medical faculties and includes feedback from experienced educators. The main disadvantage is that medical simulations are resource intensive, posing significant organizational challenges due to limited staff availability, compromising training opportunities [2]. In order to improve SBE delivery possibilities, senior residents could be engaged as teachers. We evaluated the effect of a resident-led SBE program on the confidence level of FYR to manage common critical care scenarios.Methods:This study included FYR from internal medicine, anesthesiology and emergency medicine. The course was voluntary and encompassed an online module, followed by 4-h simulation training containing eight common critical care scenarios. Senior residents (third year or higher) who facilitated the training received a one-day training on didactic principles. FYR self-confidence was measured before and after the course and rated on a scale from 0 to 100% using a validated questionnaire [3].Results:Forty FYR participated in the course.

The traditional method of transmitting specialized knowledge through role modeling when educating students on clinical procedures has given rise to issues such as inadequate understanding and difficulty in maintaining motivation. Therefore, we focus on simulation-based education and group discussion. The aim of this research was to evaluate the state of training and clarify future issues.Methods:Simulation-based education was performed for medical students and residents and a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the impact the training had on them. The research was performed between January 2022 and October 2022. We have the following four steps: classroom learning; simulation-based education giving the roles of surgeon, caregiver and instructor; group discussions; and summary with the supervising physician.Results:A total of 75 medical students and 5 residents participated, and all of the participants reported that the simulation exercise was useful. When residents performed the procedure on an actual patient after the simulation education, 80% of the residents were successful in their first attempt. Most of the post-procedure comments were positive, such as participants having “more confidence in the procedure” and “a clear understanding of the points of procedure”.

The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified pressures on healthcare staff, resulting in deteriorating mental health and increased incidence of stress and burn out. The Intensive Care Society (ICS) has placed emphasis on peer support to combat this; recognising that working in a ‘psychologically safe’ environment improves wellbeing, enables safe and compassionate care, and reduces mistakes [1]. The aim of peer support is to improve wellbeing by offering a systematic, strategic approach to sustain staff who are coping well and provide initial support to those who are struggling.Methods:Staff who have undertaken ICS training, under the supervision of a clinical psychologist, facilitate fortnightly meetings open to all ICU trainees. They also act as an initial contact to provide advice and guidance on addressing the psychological difficulties highlighted above. An anonymous screening questionnaire at the start of each session allows a moment of reflection for trainees prior to discussion. This, in addition to anonymous feedback, provides qualitative data to both audit the programme and inform improvement.Results:Participation in peer support is voluntary, nonetheless attendance at meetings has been excellent. Initial qualitative results indicate that most trainees feel ‘nervous, anxious or on edge’, ‘question their capability at work’ and are ‘unable to stop thinking about work/a significant event at work’ at least a few days per week. Feedback from trainees regarding the programme has been intensely positive.Conclusions:Anxiety and stress are high amongst ICU trainees which can lead to psychological harm if not addressed. Engagement from trainees in our programme has been good and feedback positive, emphasising the need for peer support in the ICU.ReferenceWilliams R et al.

Thus, this study aimed to explore the experience of registrar-grade doctors undergoing the transition to intensive care medicine (ICM), and to examine the interplay between personal and professional life during this transition.Methods:This qualitative study was guided by transcendental phenomenology and multiple and multimodal transitions theory (MMT). Data were collected via eleven semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using a six-step thematic analysis. Peer debriefing, audit trail and a reflexive diary were used.Results:The experience of doctors undergoing the transition to ICM was found to be influenced by the clinical environment of the ICU, which was noted to be a demanding and potentially stressful workplace, and one in which the support of colleagues was greatly valued (Fig. 1). The individual characteristics of the doctor undergoing the transition impacted upon this transition, as their previous experience and the impact of the transition on their professional development and identity were observed to be influential. In keeping with MMT, the interplay between personal and professional life was significant, as participants outlined the impact of anxiety before a work shift, the emotional and cognitive burden of a shift, and the effect of the transition to ICM on their personal relationships.Conclusions:This study observes the ICU to be an extremely challenging workplace environment, with a notable influence on the personal lives of those working therein. Nevertheless, ICM offers invaluable opportunity for learning and both personal and professional growth.Fig. 1 (abstract P354).

Of these 102 (50%) were present at moment of death. The four main themes emerged: Communication; Care and treatment; Visiting and Perceptions and understanding (Fig. 1). Across themes, communication was intrinsically linked to all aspects of a NOK’s experience but mostly with patient care. Several clinical learning points were identified including NOK’s involvement in decision making and timing and delivery of complex information.Conclusions:Using ME collected data has proven a valuable source of insightful feedback.

The aim was to investigate agreement between family and intensivists’ assessment concerning patient’s evolution of health, focusing on family members’ resilience and their perceptions about decision-making.Methods:For each ICU patient, withdrawal criteria were assessed by intensivists while family members assessed the development of patient's health and completed Connor-Davidson Mental Endurance- and Self-Compassion-Scale. Six months after ICU discharge, a follow-up contact was established, and family members responded about two hypothetical scenarios.Results:162 ICU patients and 189 family members were recruited. Intensivists decision about whether a patient met the withdrawal criteria had 75.9% accuracy for prediction of survival, while family’s assessments was statistically independent of intensivist’s opinion; resilience had a significant positive effect on probability of agreement with intensivists. Six months after discharge, family members whose relatives were still alive were significantly more likely to consider family or patient himself as those who should be involved in decision-making.Conclusions:Resilience is related to an enhanced probability of agreement of family with intensivists’ perception of patient’s health evolution.

The essential predictors that influence family satisfaction were identified using quantitative and qualitative analyses.Results:Seventy-three out of the 227 patients' NOK who initially agreed, completed the FS-ICU questionnaire (response rate 32.2%). The mean (SD) FS-ICU/total was 63.9 (30.8). The mean score for satisfaction with FS-ICU/dm was lower than the FS-ICU/care (62.1 [30.30 vs. 65.4 [31.4];p0.001) (Fig. 1).

The remote audio-visual doffing surveillance (RADS) system has the potential to overcome this limitation [1, 2]. We aimed to compare the efficacy of this real-time RADS system against the onsite buddy system for monitoring the doffing of PPE.Methods:This prospective, observational study was conducted at our tertiary care centre in northern India. Study was registered in the clinical trial registry India (CTRI/2020/11/038172). 200 HCWs who cared for COVID-19 patients in the intensive care units were included. Group A included HCWs who performed doffing with the help of an onsite trained observer and group B included HCWs who performed doffing with the RADS system.

In both groups, there was no difference in HCWs feedback regarding the ease of the system and fear of committing an error. Though the perceived quality of monitoring was felt better with onsite buddy, the overall confidence rating of being safe after doffing was better with the RADS system.Conclusions:Real-time RADS system may be more effective than the onsite buddy system for ensuring the safety of HCWs during doffing PPE. HCWs level of satisfaction related to the ease and anxiety with the monitoring systems were comparable. RADS system can reduce reliance on HCW resources and can integrate well into existing healthcare systems.ReferencesSingh A et al. Anesth Analg. 2020;131:e112–3.Naik BN et al.

A contributing factor is the ICU environment; in particular the noise which patients experience. We aimed to describe the characteristics of sound pressure levels (SPLs) that patients and staff are exposed to in an 11 bed bay of a district general hospital in order to target noise limiting interventions.Methods:SPLs (LAeq1 min and 1 h; A-weighted continuous equivalent SPL, LAFmax; A-weighted fast constant maximum SPL, and Lpeak; peak SPL) were monitored continuously over a 116 day period using a SoundEar3 (NoiseMeters Ltd) noise activated warning device. Data were extracted and diurnal median and interquartile LAeqvalues were plotted. Diurnal rates of LAFmaxvalues above different thresholds were plotted.

Despite this, the processes and influences on decision-making have been poorly defined. Our aim was to synthesise existing research to identify factors influencing clinicians’ decisions surrounding organ support.Methods:We conducted a systematic search on three databases (PubMed, Embase and CINAHL) to find relevant papers exploring human factors that influenced decisions made by critical care clinicians. A meta-ethnography was then completed on included papers. The data were collated into a common format and cross-compared. This generated distinct themes/subthemes that were synthesised to develop a higher order interpretation.Results:33 studies (from 8647 citations) met the inclusion criteria. 21 of these only included nurses, 7 only doctors and 5 were interprofessional. 11 factors that influenced a clinician’s decision-making were identified: experience; professional and personal risk; uncertainty; characteristics of individuals; senior support; team hierarchy; decision making by colleagues; protocols, guidelines and evidence; time and workload; hospital structure; and clinical condition. These were grouped into four themes: human, team, system and patient factors. From our interpretation of the data, we developed a model of how these themes interact to influence clinicians’ decision-making (Fig. 1).Conclusions:While decision-making surrounding organ support is complex and dynamic we identified recurring themes that influenced these decisions across different professions and environments.

One measure is to transfer a patient to another ICU; a so-called ‘capacity transfer’. Understanding the impact of capacity transfers on patient outcomes is of utmost importance since these transfers are not carried for the benefit of the patient. The purpose of the current study was to examine the idea that capacity transfer is associated with increased mortality compared to non-transferred patients who either died in the ICU or were discharged alive to a regular hospital ward.Methods:In this multicentre, case-controlled, matched observational cohort study, we collected data between January 2016 and December 2019 from 68 ICUs. Capacity transferred patients were matched 1:10 using controls from the same ICU, with a stay as long or longer to avoid immortal time bias in the non-exposed population. We compared adjusted 30- and 90-day mortality rates in patients exposed to capacity transfer with non-transferred patients using potential outcomes modelling and mixed effects logistic regression modelling with propensity score adjustment.Results:95,909 individuals from 68 ICUs were eligible for inclusion. The main analysis group included 13,670 patients of which 1243 had been transferred due to capacity reasons. Capacity transfer was associated with a risk increase in 30-day mortality of 4.7% (95% CI 2.0–7.4;p= 0.001) compared to non-transferred patients when analysed using a potential outcomes framework (Table 1). The average risk increase in 90-day mortality was 4.9% (95% CI 2.1–7.8:p= 0.001).Conclusions:This study demonstrates that patients undergoing capacity transfers are exposed to an increased mortality risk with about one additional death for every 20 transferred patients, which was neither caused by illness severity on admission nor by additional factors in the referring ICU.Table 1 (abstract P366).

The questionnaire is divided into 7 scales and allows a wide assessment of safety culture which has been associated with improved outcomes and reduced adverse incidents [2]. The two surveys straddle the Covid-19 pandemic which has had a recognised impact on staff welfare. We postulated that this is likely to be identifiable within the survey and wished to understand the effect on different staff groups and levels of experience.Methods:The survey was distributed using an online platform and analysed in R.Results:1647 questionnaires were completed in 2019 (753) and 2022 (894). Demographic data was collected for role (nursing, medical, AHP, support) and critical care experience (short: < 4 years medium: 4–10 years, long: > 10 years). For all staff Climate scores fell significantly in all scales except stress recognition, most noticeably in job satisfaction and working conditions. This was also the case within the nursing subgroup; however, it was not seen in medical staff (though there was a less pronounced trend). AHPs reported a marked reduction in job satisfaction. Support staff also demonstrated big reductions in all scales including teamworking and safety climate. The fall in job satisfaction and working condition scales were also most profound in staff with 4–10 year’s critical care experience.Conclusions:The pressures of the pandemic have had a lasting effect on most staff groups, particularly in job satisfaction and working conditions. This appears to have particularly impacted nursing and support staff. Those of moderate experience may have been the staff most directly involved with increased patient care and expectations to undertake managerial roles with reduced training. The impact of this appears to be ongoing despite efforts to support staff well-being.ReferencesSexton J. BMC Health Serv Res 2006;6:44–54.Colla JB. Qual Saf Health Care"

Hand hygiene compliance at night/weekends might not be comparable. Using a vest-cam (a camera attached to the shirt front) potentially allows hand hygiene compliance to be monitored at all hours of the day by retrospective analysis of the video footage. In this pilot study we present a comparison of hand hygiene observations made by an observer, versus analysis of vest-cam video taken in parallel.Methods:Following ethics approval, 20 min observation periods were performed on ICU staff wearing a vest-cam. A human observer recorded hand hygiene opportunities (entrance and exit from the patient areas), and hand hygiene performance. The vest-cam video was analyzed by an independent observer according to the same parameters for hand hygiene opportunities and performance. The two records were then compared.Results:Twelve observation periods were analyzed. One was excluded due to camera misplacement that resulted in the caregiver's hands not being visible. Hand hygiene performance was identified by the vest cam on 68/81 (84%) occasions versus 58/81 (72%) by the observer (p= 0.09). Mean hand hygiene performance time was 10 ± 8 vs 11 ± 21 s (p= 0.74). Not all hand hygiene performance was associated with defined hand hygiene opportunities. Hand hygiene events were identified on 82 occasions. All events were identified from the vest-cam (82/82, 100%), while (67/82, 82%) were identified by the observer (p< 0.001). Calculated hand hygiene compliance was similar: vest cam vs observer 51/82 (62%) versus 43/67 (64%,p= ns).Conclusions:Analysis of video footageobtained from a shirt front mounted video camera was able to identify hand hygiene opportunities and performance at least as well as an observer. While this technique may be associated with ethical dilemmas, potentially it allows monitoring of hand hygiene compliance outside usual office hours.P369Exploring intensive care unit (ICU) consultations with a focus on treatment limitations: a critical incident analysisASY Kraaijkamp1, RH Kochen2, BPA Spaetgens3, L Schultinge2, CMH Pinxt2, MHJ Van den Beuken-van Everdingen4, WNKA Van Mook21Maastricht University Hospital, Intensive Care Department, Palliative Care Department, Maastricht, Netherlands,2Maastricht University Hospital, Intensive Care Department, Maastricht, Netherlands,3Maastricht University Hospital, Geriatric Care department, Maastricht, Netherlands,4Maastricht University Hospital, Palliative Care Department, Maastricht, NetherlandsCritical Care2023,27(S1): P369Introduction:The ICU is frequently consulted when a (frail)"

However, considering patient-tailored care, this potentially leads to the escalation of care disproportionately to the patient's preferences, pre-existing quality of life, and functioning. Alternatively, other medical specialists, such as the palliative team, can be consulted to discuss less-invasive, comfort-based treatment options. The aim was to gain better insight into the underlying motives behind ICU consultations on general wards with a focus on (prior) documented treatment limitations (such as do-not-resuscitate, do-not-intubate, comfort-only preferences) or for whom intensivists deem ICU treatment too invasive. Concomitantly, to explore the potential role of an earlier involvement of the palliative team in these consultations.Methods:A qualitative study using a critical incident technique and thematic analysis.Results:In total, 36 individual interviews were conducted between April and July 2022, with 18 ICU nurses and intensivists(in-training) consulted by general wards of a tertiary academic centre. The palliative team was involved in 6% at the time of consultation, 84% of the patients were estimated to have a life expectancy of fewer than 12 months, and 58% died within 2 months. The themes frequently discussed were awareness of the burdens of ICU treatment, establishing conformity about supervision, and timely communication about treatment limitations. Participants acknowledged the underutilization of the palliative care team due to invisibility (outside office hours) but saw a potentially valuable role in the earlier consultation of this team.Conclusions:Although intensivists are watchful for inordinate invasive care and share responsibility for counselling or discussing treatment limitations, earlier consultation of potential other actors such as the palliative team might contribute to more patient-tailored care and more efficient use of ICU resources.P370TEPology: reconsidering treatment escalation planning on ICUE Harlow, W WoodwardRoyal Cornwall Hospital, Critical Care, Cornwall, UKCritical Care2023,27(S1): P370Introduction:Treatment escalation planning (TEP) is a dynamic and nuanced process, but for effective communication and handover is often summarised into a binary decision of whether or not to attempt resuscitation. Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) status is recognised in 22 European countries [1] and in the UK, where a TEP proforma is frequently used in patient notes. The UK Guidelines for the Provision of Intensive Care Services (GPICS) states that all patients should have a treatment escalation plan documented [2], but provides little further guidance as to when it should be completed or what form it should take.Methods:We audited TEP proforma completion on a general ICU in Cornwall, UK, and compared results to patient records that included either a proforma or narrative indices of treatment escalation planning.Results:21% of"

Whilst narrative indices recorded in the Consultant notes were more common than TEP proformas, and likely better represent the complexity of TEP decisions while on ICU, the use of standardised proformas at time of ICU discharge contributes to more effective handover, which is crucial for ongoing care and reduction of readmission rates. Use of the proforma should serve to prompt discussion within the MDT, and with patients and their relatives to inform shared decision making. We plan to make TEP proformas mandatory at time of discharge, and reaudit in 3 months.

The aim of this study was to identify the incidence and characteristics of patients who died in general wards after discharge from ICU.Methods:Retrospective study of all patients discharged from a tertiary center ICU from April 2021 to October 2022. Demographic data, severity scores and hospital mortality were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by χ2and t Student tests.Results:In this period, 715 out of 962 patients were discharged from our ICU and 55 (8%) died in the wards: 33% in the first 5 days, 18% from 6th to 10th day and 49% from 11th day on. Cause of death was: sepsis (47%), irreversible neurological injury (17%), cardiovascular disease (12%) and tracheostomy obstruction (10%). Comparing to the patients who were discharged home alive, the patients who died in the wards were older (average age 66.6 vs 58.0 years), had shorter ICU length of stay (mean 15.5 vs 23.4 days), had a higher percentage of tracheostomies (34.5 vs 14.2%), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3.6 vs 2.7), higher APACHE II (23.9 vs 18.9) and SAPS-II (52.8 vs 43.3) at ICU admission, higher SOFA at ICU admission (8.9 vs 7.1) and discharge (4.8 vs 2.9) and higher standardized mortality (53% vs 37%).

Quality of end-of-life (EoL) care focuses on patient/family support, symptom management, minimising distress, and withdrawing/withholding inappropriate treatment [1]. Following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, death can be rapid and potentially distressing, hence a smooth transition is paramount with good communication and adequate symptom control [2].Methods:Service evaluation of EoL practices in a large, tertiary London hospital. Data collected from 1/5 to 16/6/22 on ICU patients transitioning to EoL care.Results:43 EoL patients (Table 1). Treatment limitations were placed for 27 (44%), prior to EoL transition. Treatment withdrawal in 30 (70%) patients: 12 (28%) palliative extubated, 7 (16%) remained intubated but other support withdrawn. 7 (16%) remained on full support. EoL medications were delivered as an infusion in 26 (60%) patients in 24 h before death: 8 (19%) subcutaneously and 18 (42%) intravenously. 8 (19%) remained on high doses with ongoing support, 16 (37%) had reduced infusion rates for comfort only. The most common infused drugs were fentanyl (50–400 mcg/hr), midazolam (20 mg/24 h-10 mg/hr), morphine (15–150 mg/24 h) and glycopyrronium (600–1200 mcg/24 h). Sedation was deep prior to death (RASS-3.8, 24 h and -3.6, 48 h). Reasons for low RASS were severe brain injury, continued full support and agitation. Mean time from EoL transition to death was 1.25 days.Conclusions:Death in ICU can be challenging, due to the highly technical environment, co-existence of multiple organ failure and inability to communicate with the patient. Despite national guidance, the practicalities of transitioning from curative to EoL care vary, even in a single institution. The more distinct variability was observed around the use of EoL medication, with doses exceeding those used in palliative care settings.ReferencesFaculty of Intensive Care Medicine.

It is recognised that early palliative care input improves symptom control, family support, length of CCU stay and the use of clinical interventions towards the end of life. Triggers is a tool to help identify patients that may benefit from early palliative care intervention [1]. The tool was adapted by the Royal Marsden Hospital to identify emergency admissions onto CCU that may benefit from early palliative care review.Methods:A local, multi-cycle retrospective review was conducted with data collected through the electronic patient record system. We collected three data sets—one prior to and two (short and long term) following the implementation of the Triggers tool.Results:Prior to implementation of the tool, data collected between April 2018–April 2019 showed that 149 patients died on CCU or within 30 days of admission. Of these patients, only 56% were referred to the symptom control and palliative care team (SCPCT) however 97% of these patients would have flagged as Triggers positive. Data between February 2020 and January 2021, after implementation of the Triggers tool, showed that 36% of CCU emergency admissions had a Triggers tool completed. Figure 1 shows the results of this sample. 44% of emergency admissions during this time would have flagged as Triggers positive. Overall, 23% of emergency admissions were referred to the SCPCT, of which 46% of these were due to the tool. Data from January to September 2022, showed a Triggers completion rate of 33%. 100% of emergency admissions would have flagged as Triggers positive. Overall, 33% of emergency admissions were referred to SCPCT due to the tool.Conclusions:The use of this novel bespoke Triggers tool is now a standard part of the admission process to CCU.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are a mainstay of medical research but have multiple drawbacks including cost and inefficiency. Bayesian adaptive trials may address these drawbacks, but are more complex and potentially less accepted by the medical community.Methods:We surveyed United States intensivists identified from an American Medical Association email list. Participants were randomized to view an abstract describing a hypothetical Bayesian adaptive or traditional frequentist trial. The abstracts were otherwise similar in format and content with results derived from the same simulated data. Participants were then asked about self-perceived and measured understanding as well as acceptance of the trial findings. Survey results were analyzed using proportional odds logistic regression.Results:There were 273 responses to 592 surveys (46.1%) and the groups were well balanced. The frequentist group had significantly better self-perceived (p< 0.01 andp< 0.01) and measured understanding (p< 0.01,p= 0.08,p< 0.01, andp= 0.04). There was no significant difference in acceptance between groups (p= 0.47 andp= 0.10). Acceptance was significantly correlated with both self-perceived and measured understanding (Table 1). These results did not change substantially when adjusting for age, practice setting, clinical time, and subspecialty. Opinions on the increasing use of Bayesian methods were mixed: 49.5% positive, 39.2% neutral or undecided, and 11.4% negative.Conclusions:Despite lower understanding of Bayesian adaptive trials compared to frequentist trials among intensivists we found no difference in acceptance of results. Understanding and acceptance were correlated and a high proportion of intensivists were neutral or undecided about Bayesian adaptive trials so our findings suggest further efforts to educate clinicians on these methods are warranted.Table 1 (abstract P374).

We then retrospectively analyzed all patients admitted to ICU in 2018 in the province of Alberta, Canada and identified those who could have been considered for the chosen landmark trials based on their clinical characteristics. We finally performed a decision tree analysis to describe the number of patients, both in community and academic settings, that could have been eligible for participation in landmark trials. We further estimated the differences in time to completion with inclusion of community ICU patients.Results:10,157 adult patients were admitted to Alberta ICUs in 2018. 5650 (55.6%) were in academic centers and 4507 (44.4%) were in community hospitals. The inclusion of community ICU patients in the selected landmark critical care trials would have led on average to a 64% increase in the number of patients potentially enrolled. Furthermore, it would have decreased the mean time to completion of trials from an estimated 2.8 years with academic ICU patients only to 1.6 years (43% reduction in duration).Conclusions:The inclusion of eligible patients admitted to community ICUs in multi-center clinical trials can accelerate recruitment and reduce time to trial completion."
