    "full_text": "TITLE: International Consensus Criteria for Pediatric Sepsis and Septic Shock ABSTRACT: Key PointsQuestionHow should children with suspected infection at higher risk of mortality, indicative of sepsis, be identified?FindingsUsing an international survey, systematic review, and analysis of more than 3 million pediatric health care encounters, and consensus process, new criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children were developed. Pediatric sepsis in children (<18 years) with suspected infection was identified by at least 2 points in the novel Phoenix Sepsis Score, including dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems; and septic shock as sepsis with at least 1 cardiovascular point in the Phoenix Sepsis Score.MeaningThe new criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock are globally applicable.
