These advances include new antithrombotic agents, new options for dyslipidemia treatment, and novel techniques for surgical stroke prevention. In addition, there is greater recognition of the benefits of multi-faceted interventions, including the role of physical activity and dietary modification. Despite these advances, the aging of the population and the high prevalence of key vascular risk factors pose challenges to reducing the burden of stroke. Using an etiology-based framework, current approaches to prevention of cardioembolic, cryptogenic, atherosclerotic, and small vessel disease stroke are outlined in this paper. Special emphasis is given to recent trials of antithrombotic agents, including studies that have tested combination treatments and response according to genetic factors."
