This latest summary addresses the most recent published resuscitation evidencereviewed by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation task force science experts. Members from 6 InternationalLiaison Committee on Resuscitation task forces have assessed, discussed, and debated the quality of the evidence, usingGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, and their statements include consensustreatment recommendations. Insights into the deliberations of the task forces are provided in the Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights sections. In addition, the task forces list priority knowledge gaps for further research.\n\nKey Words: AHA Scientific Statements ◼ advanced life support ◼ basic life support ◼ cardiac arrest ◼ first aid ◼ ILCOR◼ neonatal ◼ resuscitation\n\nAbbreviations and AcronymsAEDautomated external defibrillationALSadvanced life supportBLSbasic life supportBMVbag-mask ventilationBPblood pressureCACcardiac arrest centerCERTAContinuous EEG Randomized Trial in AdultsCOPDchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseCPRcardiopulmonary resuscitationDA-CPRdispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitationECLSextracorporeal life supportECMOextracorporeal membrane oxygenationECPRextracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitationEEGelectroencephalogramEITEducation, Implementation, and TeamsEMSemergency medical servicesFAfirst aidGRADEGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and EvaluationICUintensive care unitIHCAin-hospital cardiac arrestILCORInternational Liaison Committee on ResuscitationIPDindividual patient dataIQRinterquartile rangeMAPmean arterial pressureNLSneonatal life supportNMAnetwork meta-analysisNNTnumber needed to treatOHCAout-of-hospital cardiac arrest\n\nPEARLSPromoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in SimulationPICOpopulation, intervention, comparator, outcomePICOSTpopulation, intervention, comparator, outcome, study design, and time framePLSpediatric life supportPROSPEROProspective Register of Systematic ReviewsRCDPrapid cycle deliberate practiceRCTrandomized controlled trialsROCreturn of circulationROSCreturn of spontaneous circulationSGAsupraglottic airwaySTEMIST-segment–elevation myocardial infarctionTELSTARTreatment of Electroencephalo- graphic Status Epilepticus After Cardiopulmonary ResuscitationTItracheal intubation\n\nThis Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) Inter-is the eighth in a series of annual Internationalnational Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resusci-tation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science WithTreatment Recommendations (CoSTR) summary pub-lications summarizing the ILCOR task forces’ analysesof published resuscitation evidence since ILCOR beganthe more continuous process of evidence evaluation in2015. Summarizing the work from the 6 task forces overthe past year, this year’s review includes 19 systematicreviews (SysRevs) with new or updated treatment rec-ommendations. Although only SysRevs can generate afull CoSTR and new treatment recommendations, 14scoping reviews (ScopRevs) and 30 evidence updates(EvUps) are also included.\n\nDraft CoSTRs for all topics evaluated with SysRevswere posted on a rolling basis between December 1,\n\nDownloadedfromhttp://ahajournals.orgbyonMay25,2025\n\n2023, and January 24, 2024, on the ILCOR website.1 Eachdraft CoSTR includes the data reviewed and draft treat-ment recommendations, with public comments acceptedfor 2 weeks after posting. In some cases, if requested,public comment was permitted for longer. Task forcesconsidered public feedback and provided responses. The33 draft CoSTR statements and ScopRevs were viewed≈18 200 times, and 38 comments were provided. AllCoSTRs are now available online, adding to the existingCoSTR statements.\n\nThis summary statement contains the final wordingof the treatment recommendations and good practicestatements as approved by the ILCOR task forces, but itdiffers in several respects from the online CoSTRs. Thelanguage used to describe the evidence is not restrictedto standard Grading of Recommendations Assess-ment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) terminol-ogy,2 making it more accessible to a wider audience,and in some cases only the high-priority outcomes arereported. The Justification and Evidence-to-DecisionFramework Highlights sections are generally shortenedbut aim to provide a transparent rationale for treatmentrecommendations. The complete evidence-to-decisionframeworks are provided in Appendix A. Finally, the taskforces have prioritized knowledge gaps requiring futureresearch studies. Links to the published reviews andfull online CoSTRs are provided in the correspondingsections.\n\nThe CoSTRs are based on analysis of the data usingthe GRADE approach.2 SysRevs are conducted byexpert systematic reviewers or by task force members,always with the involvement of ILCOR content experts.The GRADE approach guides the rating of the certaintyof evidence that supports the intervention effects (pre-defined by the population, intervention, comparator, out-come [PICO] question). Certainty is categorized as high,moderate, low, or very low. Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) begin the analysis as high-certainty evidence, andobservational studies begin the analysis as low-certaintyevidence. Certainty of evidence can be downgraded forrisk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, orpublication bias; it can be upgraded for a large effect, fora dose-response effect, or if any residual confoundingwould be thought to decrease the detected effect.\n\nThe format for outcome data reporting varies by thedata available but ideally includes both relative risk (RR)and the absolute risk difference (ARD), both with 95%CI. The ARD enables a more clinically useful assess-ment of the magnitude of the effect of an interventionand enables calculation of the number needed to treat(NNT=1/ARD). When the data do not enable absoluteeffect estimates, alternative measures of effect such asodds ratios (ORs) are reported.\n\nTreatment recommendations are generated by thetask forces after evaluating the evidence and after dis-cussion. The strength of a recommendation does not\n\ndepend solely on the certainty of evidence but also onthe likely clinical impact as determined by task forcemembers.\n\nILCOR’s goal is to review at least 20% of all PICOquestions each year so that the CoSTRs reflect cur-rent and emerging science. Acknowledging that manyPICO topics will not have sufficient new evidence towarrant a SysRev, ILCOR implemented 2 additionallevels of evidence review in 2020. ScopRevs areundertaken when the amount and type of evidence ona broader topic is unclear. Search strategies are simi-lar in rigor to those of SysRevs, but ScopRevs do notinclude bias assessments or meta-analyses. AlthoughILCOR does not create or alter treatment recommen-dations without a SysRev, if the topic of a ScopRev isthought to be of particular interest to the resuscitationcommunity, good practice statements are often made.Good practice statements are not evidence-basedrecommendations but represent expert opinion in lightof very limited data.\n\nThe third and least rigorous form of evidence eval-uation is the EvUp, in which a minimum of a PubMedsearch is carried out to screen for significant new dataand assess whether there has been sufficient new sci-ence to warrant a more extensive review and updatedCoSTR. EvUps can inform a decision about whethera SysRev should be undertaken but are not used togenerate new or updated treatment recommendationsbecause they do not include bias assessment, GRADEevidence evaluation, or meta-analysis. In this document,ScopRevs are summarized in the relevant task force sec-tion, with references to the more complete online review.EvUps are listed at the end of each task force sectionin table form, with information including the prior treat-ment recommendation(s) related to the PICO question,how many new studies were identified, key findings, andwhether an updated SysRev is recommended.

thus, it was considered timely to update theSysRev completed for the 2020 CoSTR.4,5 The SysRevwas registered before initiation (International Prospec-tive Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO]CRD42017080475).7 The full online CoSTR can befound on the ILCOR website.8\n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome,Study Design, and Time Frame\n\n• Population: Adults or children in cardiac arrest(OHCA and in-hospital cardiac arrest [IHCA])• Intervention: The performance of CPR using a hardsurface (eg, backboard, floor, or deflatable or spe-cialist mattress)• Comparators: The performance of CPR on a regularmattress or other soft surface• Outcomes: Survival with a favorable neurologicaloutcome at hospital discharge/30 days (critical),survival at hospital discharge/30 days (critical),event survival (important), return of spontaneouscirculation (ROSC; important), CPR quality (eg,compression depth, compression rate, compressionfraction; important)• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlledbefore-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eli-gible for inclusion. Unpublished studies (eg, con-ference abstracts, trial protocols) were excluded.Randomized manikin simulation or cadaver studieswere included only if insufficient human studieswere identified. Studies were included regardless oflanguage if an abstract in English was available.\n\n• Time frame: The dates searched were September17, 2019 (date of the search for the previousSysRev), to February 5, 2024.\n\nConsensus on Science\n\nIn addition to the 11 manikin simulation RCTs9–19 identi-fied in the previous review,6 we identified 1 small ob-servational study20 and 6 additional manikin RCTs21–26addressing this population, intervention, comparator,outcome, study design, and time frame (PICOST) ques-tion. The overall certainty of evidence was rated as verylow to low due to risk of bias and serious indirectness.No studies reported patient outcomes. The includedstudies were grouped by surfaces studied: backboardversus hospital mattress, floor versus hospital mat-tress, floor versus firm home mattress, and floor versusother surface types. The small observational study thatcompared a backboard with a hospital mattress useda single accelerometer for measurement, and the re-sults were considered unreliable.20 Results of the meta-analysis of data from the manikin simulation studies aregiven in Table 1.\n\nPrior Treatment Recommendations (2020)\n\nWe suggest performing chest compressions on a firmsurface when possible (weak recommendation, verylow–certainty evidence).\n\nDuring in-hospital cardiac arrest, we suggest, wherea bed has a CPR mode which increases mattress stiff-ness, it should be activated (weak recommendation, verylow–certainty of evidence).\n\nDuring in-hospital cardiac arrest, we suggest againstmoving a patient from a bed to floor to improve chest\n\nTable 1.

Mat-tress compression can be as high as 57% of total com-pression depth, with greater compression seen in softermattresses.27–29 This can lead to reduced spinal-sternaldisplacement and a reduction in effective chest compres-sion depth. It is known that effective compression depthscan be achieved on soft surfaces if the CPR providerincreases overall compression depth to compensate formattress compression.30–33 CPR feedback devices thataccount for mattress compression (eg, the use of dual,and not single, accelerometers or increasing compres-sion depth targets) can help CPR providers to ensureadequate compression depth when CPR is performed ona mattress.11,33–35\n\nIn making these recommendations, the task forceconsidered the importance of high-quality chest com-pressions and minimizing delays to the initiation of CPRand the lack of human data, including patient outcomes.Within the limitations of manikin studies, the availableevidence indicates that using a backboard on a hospitalmattress provides only a marginal depth benefit that isunlikely to be clinically significant. In considering whether\n\nto transfer a patient to the floor to improve compressiondepth, the task force considered the risks of harm (eg,interruption in CPR, risk of losing vascular access) tothe patient and resuscitation team outweighed any smallimprovement in chest compression depth. The additionof 2 studies simulating out-of-hospital settings (wherebeds may be softer) and one where the CPR providermay be a single untrained rescuer led the task force tobroaden the recommendations to include OHCA. Thetask force felt the indirect evidence on backboards wasnot sufficient to have backboards removed where theyare currently used. However, users should be aware thatmattress stiffness and backboard size and orientationinfluence the backboard’s effectiveness.36–39\n\n• Studies reporting clinical outcomes• Studies examining the logistical aspects of back-board deployment or moving a patient from a bed tothe floor• Studies in both high- and low-resource settingswhere hospital bed or prehospital stretcher configu-rations may vary\n\nRationale for Review\n\nThe 2020 CoSTR on dispatcher-assisted diagnosis ofcardiac arrest recommended that dispatch centers lookfor ways to optimize sensitivity of recognition of cardiacarrest.4,5 These interventions have not been reviewed byILCOR before. A ScopRev was conducted to understandfactors related to DA recognition and to review the cur-rent state of evidence for interventions aiming to opti-mize timely recognition to inform the development of aPICOST for a SysRev.40 The full online CoSTR can befound on the ILCOR website.41\n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome,Study Design, and Time Frame\n\n• Population: Adults and children who are in cardiacarrest outside of a hospital.• Intervention: Factors and interventions that improvedispatcher-assisted recognition of cardiac arrest.• Outcomes: Dispatcher-assisted recognition of car-diac arrest defined as initiation of cardiac arrest–specific actions, such as instructions to performCPR.• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlledbefore-and-after studies, cohort studies, qualitative)were eligible for inclusion. All relevant studies withan abstract in English were included.• Time frame: The search of Medline was performedon June 2, 2023, from database inception to June2, 2023.\n\nThis ScopRev identified 60 relevant articles.42–101 Theincluded articles described 4 major categories and 18subcategories: 2 major categories and 11 subcategoriesrelate to factors found to influence DA recognition, and 2major categories and 7 subcategories were interventionsaiming to improve DA recognition (Table 2). The detailedfindings within each theme are summarized in the fullCoSTR on the ILCOR website.41\n\n• Most of the studies identified were retrospective,observational studies assessing the proportionof OHCAs recognized by dispatchers and factorsassociated with OHCA recognition. Only 1 studyreported dispatcher-assisted recognition in pediat-ric arrests. There were no studies testing 2 differentprotocols in a randomized trial.• The most pertinent challenge to dispatcher-assistedrecognition of OHCA seems to be determiningwhether the patient is breathing normally. Severalstrategies were studied, including bypassing breath-ing in the initial assessment and asking the caller toput their hand on the patient’s stomach. No strat-egy showed better results than the commonly used2-questions strategies. Although several strategieswere tested, there were no RCTs comparing differ-ent strategies.\n\nTable 2. Categories and Subcategories of FactorsInfluencing Dispatcher-Assisted Recognition of OHCA\n\nCCTV indicates closed-circuit television; MPDS, medical priority dispatch sys-tem; and OHCA, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\nCategoriesSubcategoriesFactors related to dispatcher-assisted recognitionCommunication between caller and dispatcher (n=16)1.

Although the model had ahigher rate of recognition of OHCA, it did not improvedispatcher recognition of OHCA when implementedin practice. The main problem appeared to be highfalse positive rates.• Based on this ScopRev, there is insufficient evi-dence to pursue a new SysRev on this topic.\n\n• Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive valuesof different factors to improve dispatcher-assistedrecognition of OHCA, as well as how studied vari-ables affect time to recognition• How different protocols and strategies comparewith each other in randomized trials• The impact of the characteristics of dispatchers (eg,experience, training) and their exposure to OHCAcalls on OHCA recognition• When dispatchers should deviate from the scriptin the dispatch protocol. There is an expectationor necessity for dispatchers to follow and not devi-ate from a script. However, deviation may be nec-essary in certain cases, and continuation of thescript in these cases could lead to worse com-munication, lower rates of recognition of OHCA,or longer time to recognition. Studies to identifywhich cases may benefit from deviation of scriptare warranted.• How to optimize dispatcher-assisted recognition ofpediatric OHCA\n\nRationale for Review\n\nThe 2020 SysRev recommends CPR instructions beprovided by dispatchers during the emergency call.4,5 Al-though the certainty of evidence was rated as very lowat that time, dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR) hasbeen implemented widely,102–105 and the task force wasaware of new evidence examining interventions aimingto optimize DA-CPR. A ScopRev was conducted to mapthis evidence and determine if it was sufficient to warranta new SysRev of interventions to improve DA-CPR.106Studies comparing compression-only CPR with standardCPR were excluded as this topic is covered in a separateILCOR PICOST.107,108 The full online CoSTR can be foundon the ILCOR website.109\n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome,Study Design, and Time Frame\n\n• Population: Adults and children with out-of-hospitalcardiac arrest where DA-CPR is implemented• Intervention: Interventions used in addition toDA-CPR\n\n• Comparators: Nonmodified DA-CPR• Outcomes: Any outcomes• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlledbefore-and-after studies, cohort studies) wereeligible for inclusion. Unpublished studies (eg,conference abstracts, trial protocols), editorials,commentaries, animal studies, and SysRevs wereexcluded. If there were insufficient studies fromwhich to draw a conclusion, case series could beincluded in the initial search. All relevant studieswith an abstract in English were included.• Time frame: The search of Embase, Medline,Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied HealthLiterature Database, and Cochrane Database ofSystematic Reviews was performed on May 17,2023, for the period January 1, 2000, to May 17,2023.\n\nThirty-one studies were included in this ScopRev: Onewas a nonrandomized implementation trial,110 16 weresimulation studies (15 RCTs,111–125 1 nonrandomizedcomparison126), and 12 were observational studies re-viewing real-world OHCAs from registries or collecteddata80,83,126–135 or emergency call review.136 Two includedstudies used qualitative137 and mixed methods.138 Only1 study focused on pediatric cardiac arrest.117 Completedetails of the studies and findings are reported in the fullCoSTR on the ILCOR website.\n\nThe interventions examined were advanced dispatchertraining (n=3),127–129 centralization of the dispatch center(n=2),130,131 use of metronome or varied metronome rates(n=2),111,112 change in CPR sequence and compressionratio (n=1)132 an animated audiovisual recording (n=1),113prerecorded instructions compared with conversationallive instructions (n=1)114 implementation of novel DA-CPR protocols (n=4)80,83,110,115 changes in terminologyabout compressions (n=6; 1 pediatric), 116–118,126,133,136inclusion of “undress patient” instructions (n=1),119 verbalencouragement (n=1),125 and use of video at the scene(n=9).120–124,134,135,137,138\n\nThe implementation of novel DA-CPR protocols, pre-recorded instructions, centralized dispatch, advanceddispatcher training, use of metronomes and varying met-ronome rates and instructions to undress the patient allhave to make any comment on their effectiveness at this point.\n\nThe studies that focus on simplifying the compres-sion instruction language (ie, “Push as hard as you can”versus “Push ≈2 inches/5 cm”) suggest an improvementin the quality of CPR.117,118,126,133 The studies that exam-ined adding video to the emergency call, compared withaudio-only calls, suggest an improvement in CPR prac-tice (eg, hand positioning) and quality (eg, compressiondepth and rate).120–124,135\n\nThe task force discussed the review findings and notedthe following:\n\n• The lack of high-quality evidence, studies in humans,and the significant heterogeneity between studiesof the various interventions.• Terminology changes in instructions may not begeneralizable to other languages.• Almost half of the studies comparing video to audiowere simulation studies.\n\nBased on this ScopRev, there is insufficient evidenceto pursue a new SysRev on this topic.\n\n• High-quality prospective research in humans,including assessment of patient outcomes• Data on optimizing DA-CPR in pediatric cases\n\nOptimization of Dispatcher-Assisted AEDRetrieval and Use (BLS 2120: ScopRev)\n\nRationale for Review\n\nBystander use of AEDs is associated with high survivalrates from OHCA,139,140 but its use is currently infre-quent.141 This topic was selected for review by the BLSTask Force because of the widespread use of dispatchinstructions for the retrieval and use of an AED105,142 andthe need to optimize systems to improve the public’s AEDuse.143,144 Although there is no existing ILCOR treatmentrecommendation related to dispatcher- assisted AEDretrieval, the task force decided the current evidencerequired a ScopRev to fully explore the scope of thetopic. Studies using drone delivery were excluded fromthis review because this evidence was examined in the2023 CoSTR publication.146 The full online CoSTR canbe found on the ILCOR website.147\n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome,Study Design, and Time Frame\n\n• Population: Adults and children with out-of-hospitalcardiac arrest• Intervention: dispatcher-assisted AED retrieval anduse• Outcomes: Any reported outcomes• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlledbefore-and-after studies, cohort studies), simulationstudies, case series (>5 patients), trial protocols,and conference abstracts were included. All relevantstudies with an abstract in English were included.• Time frame: The search of Embase, Medline, andCochrane Central was performed on April 14, 2023,from database inception to April 13, 2023.\n\nSixteen studies were included in this ScopRev: 5 obser-vational studies reviewing real-world OHCAs148–152 and\n\n11 simulation studies (6 RCTs,153–158 1 nonrandomizedtrial,138 and 4 observational159–162).\n\nThere were no studies that examined patient out-comes. One observational study did report improvementin survival with favorable neurological outcome in 1132(of 1606) OHCAs when a DA-CPR protocol includedinstructions to retrieve an AED, but the relative contribu-tion of the dispatcher-assisted AED instruction could notbe determined from the data provided.150\n\nIn systems using dispatcher-assisted AED retrievaland use, 5 observational studies reported low rates ofAED retrieval (0.8%–5.8%),148,149,151 pad application(0.4%–1.7%),149,151,152 and shocks delivered (2.4%–11%).148,150 In one study, rates of bystander defibrillationwere greater with dispatcher instructions to retrieve anAED, compared with cases where no instructions weregiven (11% versus 5%, unadjusted Pobservational study reported confusion and delays in theemergency call after a 3-part instruction to retrieve anAED.148 Callers often had to ask the dispatcher to repeatthe instruction, or they asked clarifying questions.\n\nIn simulation studies, time to first shock, when mea-sured from the time the AED arrived, was longer whendispatcher assistance was provided than when there wasno assistance.153,154 However, when time to retrieve anAED was factored in, time to first shock was shorter.156,157\n\nAED competence scores were consistently higherwith dispatcher assistance (or an analogous form ofinstruction).138,153,154,158,162 In a simulation study, theuse of video instruction enabled the correction of padplacement, which initially was done incorrectly by mostbystanders.162 In another study the use of mobile phonevideo resulted in better performance than verbal instruc-tion alone,153 but a second study demonstrated no dif-ference.138 The use of prerecorded video instruction wasinferior to real-time (verbal) dispatcher instruction.158 In 1study, dispatchers facilitated the application of an AED in5 out of 6 cases when the AED had been brought to the(simulated) patient’s side, but the study participant didnot attempt to use it unprompted.160\n\n• There is limited published research in this area, par-ticularly on the impact on patient outcomes.• Given the majority of OHCAs occur in the home,public-access AEDs are likely to be in close prox-imity in only a minority of cases, and fewer still arelikely able to be located, retrieved, and attached to apatient in a meaningful time frame.• If an AED is not available on-site, the optimal strat-egy to consider AED retrieval depends on thenumber of available rescuers, the arrest setting (ie,residential versus public), the proximity of AEDs, thefidelity (accuracy) of AED registry, and the timeli-ness of the community’s professional response.• Research is emerging on the user-friendliness ofdifferent AED brands.163,164\n\n• There is a risk that by implementing dispatcherinstructions to retrieve and use public-accessAEDs, other aspects of the community response(eg, time to CPR, delay to dispatcher CPR instruc-tions, reduced CPR efficacy due to distraction orinterruptions) could be affected. These risks arelikely to be greatest when there is a lone rescuer atthe scene.\n\nThe studies reviewed in the present ScopRev suggestthere is currently insufficient evidence to pursue a newSysRev on this topic. There were no previous treatmentrecommendations on this topic. Given the widespreadadoption of this intervention and interest in this topic, thetask force considered the available evidence and devel-oped the following good practice statements.\n\n2024 Good Practice Statements\n\nEMS implementing dispatcher-assisted public-accessAED systems should monitor and evaluate the effective-ness of their system (good practice statement).\n\nOnce a cardiac arrest is recognized during the emer-gency call and CPR has been started, dispatchers shouldask if there is an AED (or defibrillator) immediately avail-able at the scene and ask the caller to update them whenone arrives (good practice statement).\n\nIf an AED is not immediately available and if there ismore than 1 rescuer present, dispatchers should offerinstructions to locate and retrieve an AED. Retrievalinstructions should be supported, where resourcesallow, by up-to-date registries about public-access AEDlocations and accessibility (good practice statement).\n\nOnce an AED is available, dispatchers should offerinstructions on its use (good practice statement).\n\nTask Force Knowledge Gaps\n\n• High-quality evidence of the effect of dispatcher-assisted public-access AED use on critical andimportant clinical (patient) outcomes• The effect of dispatcher-assisted public-accessAED use in pediatric cardiac arrest• The risks associated with dispatcher instructionsfor public-access AED retrieval and use during anemergency call• What contribution dispatcher instructions for public-access AED retrieval and use have in the overallcommunity and EMS response to OHCA• The barriers and facilitators to dispatcher instructionfor public-access AED retrieval and use• Which specific interventions will increase bystanderretrieval and use of a public-access AED after dis-patcher instructions• Optimization of current systems: What is the optimalway to introduce and implement dispatcher instruc-tions for public-access AED retrieval and use? Howand where should AED retrieval integrate into cur-rent dispatch protocols/algorithms? What is theoptimum phrasing to use? Do the AED’s instructions\n\ncomplement or conflict with DA-CPR instructions?What is the potential role of using live-stream videoor similar during dispatcher instruction on AED use?How best to use registries and associated technol-ogy so that dispatchers can best help bystanderslocate and retrieve AEDs?\n\nRationale for Review\n\nCPR feedback devices are intended to improve patientoutcomes through improving the quality of CPR. The2020 CoSTR on feedback for CPR quality recommend-ed the use of real-time audiovisual feedback and promptdevices during CPR when used as part of a comprehen-sive quality improvement program.4,5 There were chal-lenges with the 2020 ILCOR review due to the exclusionof many studies because they combined the evaluationof feedback with other quality improvement activities (eg,debriefing). The task force decided to perform a ScopRevto understand if the wider literature, including studieswith other interventions, may provide further insights intothe effectiveness of feedback and improve the existingPICOST question.165 Additionally, the task force conclud-ed that this review should focus on the provision of CPRby health professionals responding in a professional ca-pacity, rather than by bystanders or lay responders. Thedetailed results are provided on the ILCOR website.166\n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome,Study Design, and Time Frame\n\n• Population: Adults and children (excluding neo-nates) who are in cardiac arrest in any setting whoare resuscitated by health professionals respondingin a professional capacity• Intervention: Real-time feedback and promptdevices concerning the mechanics of CPR quality(eg, rate and depth of compressions or ventilations)• Comparators: No feedback or prompt devices, oralternative devices• Outcomes: Any outcome or measure of CPR quality• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlledbefore-and-after studies, cohort studies) are eligiblefor inclusion• Time frame: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, andCumulative Index to Nursing and Allied HealthLiterature were searched from database inceptionto July 18, 2023. A gray literature search was per-formed in the Google search engine (July 18, 2023).All relevant studies with an abstract in English wereincluded.\n\nOf the 55 studies included, we identified 10 Sys-Revs,167–176 5 RCTs,177–181 37 observational stud-ies,20,182–216 2 case series,217,218 and 1 commentary.219 The\n\npatients included varied widely between studies. Only 3studies included children,210,212,220 and most of the evi-dence consisted of before-and-after studies.\n\nThe use of metronomes was examined in 1 SysRevfrom 2014176 and 6 observational studies (3 OHCA and3 IHCA).182–187 This evidence suggests an associatedimprovement in CPR quality, but there are few data onpatient outcomes and what outcome data are reportedare not adjusted for confounding (Table 3).\n\nBy including a wider range of published studies andstudies examining audiovisual feedback with othersystem improvements, we identified 9 SysRevs,167–1755 RCTs,177–181 31 observational studies,20,188–216,220and 2 case series.217,218 Evidence examining keyoutcomes with a non-feedback comparator groupsuggests improved CPR quality, but most stud-ies reporting improved patient outcomes beyondROSC included other interventions, such as high-performance CPR and postevent debriefing (Table 4).This evidence aligns with ILCOR’s current treatmentrecommendation that feedback devices should be used aspart of a comprehensive quality improvement program.4,5\n\nTable 3.

However,the lack of RCTs was noted and many of the stud-ies published since the last review continue to havemethodological issues (eg, lack of adjustment forconfounders, small sample sizes, no patient out-comes reported).• EMS systems and hospitals in well-resourced set-tings have, or are implementing, quality improvementprograms, including the use of feedback devices,to improve the quality of CPR. This implementationmakes the study of isolated interventions, such asfeedback devices, difficult to evaluate in observationalresearch.\n\n• While 55 studies were included in the narrativesynthesis, there was insufficient new evidence torecommend a SysRev using the expanded PICOSTquestion. An update of the SysRev using the exist-ing PICOST question is recommended, with sub-groups based on the different devices and separatereview for health care professionals and lay people.• This ScopRev has revealed a substantial adjacentliterature studying the implementation of high-performance CPR and quality improvement programs,but it was not possible to extract a specific associa-tion with real-time CPR feedback from these studies.It is suggested that a new PICOST question is devel-oped that examines the impact of these programs onclinical outcomes for both OHCA and IHCA patients.\n\n2024 Treatment Recommendations (Unchangedfrom 2020)\n\nWe suggest the use of real-time audiovisual feedback andprompt devices during CPR in clinical practice as part of acomprehensive quality improvement program for cardiacarrest designed to ensure high-quality CPR delivery andresuscitation care across resuscitation systems (weakrecommendation, very low–certainty evidence).\n\nWe suggest against the use of real-time audiovisualfeedback and prompt devices in isolation (ie, not part of acomprehensive quality improvement program, weak rec-ommendation, very low–certainty evidence).\n\n• High-quality evidence adequately powered to exam-ine patient outcomes• The lack of implementation science research guid-ing the implementation of feedback devices andquality improvement programs• Studies examining the impact of ultrasound\n\nRationale for Review\n\nEarly defibrillation is associated with a large increase insurvival from OHCA.221–224 If defibrillation occurs within 3to 5 minutes of collapse, survival rates as high as 50%to 70% have been reported.223,224 EMS response timesrarely enable delivery of defibrillation in such a shorttime.225 Recently, several companies have started adver-tising “ultraportable” or “pocket” AEDs for personal useor equipping community volunteer responders to improveAED availability. These devices may be limited in thenumber and the energy of the shocks they deliver (eg,restricted to up to 20 shocks and a maximum of 85 J).\n\nThis topic has not been reviewed before, and given theinterest in these devices, the task force thought a reviewof their effectiveness in practice was timely.225a The de-tailed results are provided on the ILCOR website.226\n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome,Study Design, and Time Frame\n\n• Population: Adults and children in OHCA• Intervention: The use of an ultraportable or pocketAED• Outcomes: All outcomes were accepted• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlledbefore-and-after studies, cohort studies, conferenceabstracts, and trial protocols) were eligible for inclu-sion.

The largestRCT in the prehospital setting suggested that earlytitration to a lower oxygen target is harmful.234 Thetask forces discussed whether the evidence favoredavoiding any titration of oxygen in the out-of- hospitalsetting because most patients in the control arm ofthe EXACT trial (Reduction of Oxygen After CardiacArrest) received 100% oxygen without titration.However, most thought that once reliable measure-ment of oxygenation was available, the evidenceonly supported not titrating to a lower target rangeof 90% to 94%.\n\n• In making the recommendation to avoid hypoxemia,the task forces concluded that the physiologic basisfor hypoxia being harmful justifies its avoidance andthat detection of hypoxemia may be the best sur-rogate for true hypoxia.• The suggestion to avoid hyperoxemia is based onvery low–certainty to moderate-certainty evidencethat showed either harm (in observational stud-ies included in the 2020 SysRev) or no benefit (inRCTs) from hyperoxemia. It is important to considerthat the higher oxygen groups in RCTs generally didnot reach the very high Pao values (300–400 mm2Hg, or ≈40–53 kPa) associated with harm in someobservational studies.• The variability in oxygenation targets across RCTsand observational studies makes it difficult to identifyan evidence-based optimal range. However, the taskforces recognized the need for more precise guid-ance than that provided previously and agreed thattargeting an oxygen saturation of 94% to 98% ora Pao target of 75 to 100 mm Hg (10–13 kPa) is2reasonable.• While studies evaluating the accuracy of pulseoximetry in people with different degrees of skinpigmentation were not part of this SysRev, theSysRev team and task forces were aware of andconsidered several such studies that have founda slightly higher risk of occult hypoxemia (pulseoximetry reading of >90% saturation, while arte-rial oxygen saturation by blood gas is people with dark skin.246–248 While none of thesestudies were done in cardiac arrest patients, thetask forces concluded that it was important tomake medical professionals treating cardiac arrestpatients aware of this issue because this knowl-edge could inform decision-making about whetherto titrate supplemental oxygen. The task forces,therefore, provided a good practice statement tohighlight this issue.\n\nCarbon Dioxide Targets\n\n• The evidence from RCTs and observational studiesis inconsistent. RCTs have failed to show any effectfrom different CO2 targets. Considering the lack ofevidence for benefit or harm from targeting CO2 val-ues above or below the normal range, the task forcesdeemed it reasonable to target normocapnia, gener-ally defined as a Paco of 35 to 45 mm Hg (≈4.7–26.0 kPa), in both RCTs and observational studies.Notably, the task forces are aware of unpublisheddata from an included RCT234 as well as observa-tional studies not included in this review,249–252 sug-gesting that ETco values may not accurately reflect2Paco values, which may be an important consider-2ation in the prehospital setting. As with all criticallyill patients, there may be specific scenarios in which\n\nTable 8.

Allyears and all languages were included as long asthere was an English abstract. Observational studiesand unpublished studies (eg, conference abstracts,trial protocols) were excluded.• Time frame: The literature search was conducted inOctober 2022 and updated in August 2023.\n\nThe SysRev identified 4 RCTs of 1065 patients compar-ing lower and higher MAP targets after ROSC.257–260 Theincluded RCTs provided low-certainty evidence (down-graded for risk of bias and indirectness) of no benefitfrom a higher MAP compared with a lower MAP targetfor the critical outcomes of mortality at 180 days (RR,1.08 [95% CI, 0.92–1.26]) and good functional outcomeat 180 days (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.84–1.16]). Similarly,there was no benefit for the outcomes of ICU mortal-ity (RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.81–1.46]) or new arrhythmiaresulting in hemodynamic compromise or cardiac arrestduring ICU stay (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.77–1.40]).\n\nPrior Treatment Recommendations (2015)\n\nWe suggest hemodynamic goals (eg, MAP, systolic bloodpressure) be considered during postresuscitation careand as part of any bundle of postresuscitation interven-tions (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend specifichemodynamic goals; such goals should be considered onan individual patient basis and are likely to be influencedby post–cardiac arrest status and pre-existing comorbidi-ties (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).253,254\n\nThere is insufficient scientific evidence to recommend aspecific blood pressure goal after cardiac arrest. There-\n\nfore, we suggest a mean arterial blood pressure of atleast 60 to 65 mm Hg in patients after out-of-hospital(moderate-certainty to low-certainty evidence) and IHCA(low-certainty to very low–certainty evidence).\n\nJustification and Evidence-to-Decision FrameworkHighlights\n\nThe complete evidence-to-decision table is provided inAppendix A.\n\nIn making these updated recommendations, the ALSTask Force considered the following:\n\n• The 4 RCTs conducted since the prior review pro-vide significant new evidence but have not yet iden-tified an optimal BP strategy.• While no specific mean arterial BP strategy has beenfound to be beneficial in cardiac arrest trials, the taskforce thought it was important to provide more spe-cific guidance than had been previously provided. Thethreshold of 65 mm Hg was agreed upon becausethis threshold is the accepted standard in other formsof critical illness, and there is no evidence to deviatefrom that practice in postarrest patients. Observationaldata suggest that the lowest MAP not associatedwith a worse outcome after cardiac arrest is about60 to 70 mm Hg,261–263 and the “Surviving SepsisCampaign: International Guidelines for Managementof Sepsis and Septic Shock” recommends targeting aMAP of >65 mm Hg in patients with septic shock.264• No statistically significant benefit or harm fromtargeting a higher MAP was found for any criticaloutcome.• All RCT studies conducted thus far focused onpatients with a likely cardiac cause of the arrest anda high likelihood of a favorable outcome.• Whether a higher MAP target, such as 80 to 100mm Hg, may be beneficial for some patients has notbeen determined by trials to date. The task forceacknowledged that this is part of clinical practice atsome cardiac arrest centers. The current treatmentrecommendation purposefully does not prescribe anupper limit for MAP targets because it is unknown.\n\n• Optimal BP management in patients with cardiacarrest of noncardiac pathogenesis or with IHCA andwho have thus far not been included in trials• What MAP to target in the prehospital setting• The current evidence can exclude a relative positiveor negative treatment effect of targeting a higherMAP of higher than 25% but not lower; this differ-ence may be unrealistic, and there may be a needfor larger trials.• Whether the effect of MAP on outcome is differentin certain subgroups of patients, such as those withchronic hypertension• Whether targeting a higher BP could be beneficialin patients with deranged autoregulation\n\n• Whether increasing MAP influences cerebral orcoronary blood flow• Whether MAP, as opposed to some other proxy fororgan perfusion (lactate clearance, urinary output,capillary refill), is the optimal bedside therapeutictarget• The optimal strategy to achieve a target MAP aftercardiac arrest, which may include the use of intra-venous fluids (fluid type and volume), specific vaso-pressors or combinations of vasopressors, and useof mechanical support\n\nRationale for Review\n\nSince publication of the prior SysRev,265 the task forcehas been aware of new clinical trials examining tem-perature control in comatose post–cardiac arrest pa-tients and, therefore, updated the SysRev (PROSPEROregistration of original review CRD42020217954). TheSysRev covered the following 6 different aspects oftemperature management: (1) use of hypothermic tem-perature control, (2) timing, (3) specific temperature, (4)duration of temperature control, (5) method of tempera-ture control, and (6) rate of rewarming.

Studiesassessing cost-effectiveness were included for adescriptive summary. Unpublished studies (eg, confer-ence abstracts, trial protocols) were excluded. All lan-guages were included if there was an English abstract.• Time frame: The original literature search was per-formed on October 30, 2020, and updated for clinicaltrials on June 17, 2021. The literature search wasconducted on May 31, 2023, for the updated SysRevand on June 3, 2023, for ongoing clinical trials.\n\nConsensus on ScienceNote on Terminology\n\nThe term targeted temperature management has beenupdated as below for clarity.\n\n• Hypothermic temperature control=active tempera-ture control with the target temperature below thenormal range• Normothermic temperature control=active tem-perature control with the target temperature in thenormal range• Fever prevention temperature control=monitoringtemperature and actively preventing and treatingtemperature above the normal range• No temperature control=no protocolized active tem-perature control strategy\n\nThis updated search yielded 6 new trials investigat-ing different aspects of post–cardiac arrest temperaturecontrol, adding to the 32 trials identified in the previ-ous review. Comparisons included temperature controlversus no temperature control, timing of temperaturecontrol, specific temperature targets, durations of tem-perature control, methods of temperature control, andrates of rewarming. Key results are summarized inTable 10.
