    "full_text": "TITLE: Crafting Community-Based Participatory Research Stroke Interventions ABSTRACT: Stroke exerts a tremendous burden on individuals, families, communities, and health systems globally. Even more troublesome are the striking disparities faced across diverse populations. These disparities are further exacerbated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Despite efforts to advance stroke research, substantial gaps remain in understanding factors that contribute to stroke disparities, including the Social Determinants of Health. Strategically designed studies and tailored interventions are needed to bridge the inequities high-risk populations face and to meet their specific needs. Community-based participatory research offers an approach to equitably partner with community members to understand and work collaboratively to address community-specific health priorities. In this focused update, we highlight the main processes of community-based participatory research studies and share exemplars from our teamâ€™s work in stroke research and from the literature. As we continue to face an increasing prevalence of stroke, compounded by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic and ongoing implications of the Social Determinants of Health, partnering with communities to address community-driven health priorities can inform interventions targeted to overcome the disparities faced by certain populations."
