We aimed to validate a paediatric sepsis screening tool and derive a simplified screening tool.DesignProspective multicentre study conducted between August 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the performance of the paediatric sepsis screening tool using stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses with 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated the final model at defined risk thresholds.SettingTwelve emergency departments (EDs) in Queensland, Australia.Participants3473 children screened for sepsis, of which 523 (15.1%) were diagnosed with sepsis.InterventionsA 32-item paediatric sepsis screening tool including rapidly available information from triage, risk factors and targeted physical examination.Primary outcome measureSenior medical officer-diagnosed sepsis combined with the administration of intravenous antibiotics in the ED.ResultsThe 32-item paediatric sepsis screening tool had good predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.80, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82). A simplified tool containing 16 of 32 criteria had comparable performance and retained an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.82). To reach a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 87% to 92%), the final model achieved a specificity of 51% (95% CI 49% to 53%). Sensitivity analyses using the outcomes of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.87) and septic shock (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.88) confirmed the main results.ConclusionsA simplified paediatric sepsis screening tool performed well to identify children with sepsis in the ED. Implementation of sepsis screening tools may improve the timely recognition and treatment of sepsis. BODY: STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYThis study identified the screening criteria which were most predictive of paediatric sepsis and derived a simplified sepsis screening tool.This study validated a paediatric sepsis screening tool used in a statewide quality improvement initiative, thereby addressing a key gap highlighted by the 2020 Surviving Sepsis Campaign.Although the screening tool performed well, the average acuity of the cohort was low, consistent with contemporary paediatric cohorts in the emergency department.Limitations include risk of selection bias, and the study was not designed to demonstrate patient-centred outcome benefits of applying the sepsis tool.These finding require external validation, particularly in low-income and middle-income settings.IntroductionSurvival of patients with sepsis strongly depends on timely recognition and initiation of treatment.1 2In neonates and children, sepsis remains accountable for an estimated three million annual deaths, and mortality rates of those requiring"

By consequence, there is a lack of evidence on features to include in sepsis screening tools. Only a small number of—mostly single-centre studies—have reported specifically on screening for sepsis, including two-tiered approaches with electronic health record-based triggers followed by clinician assessment.9 15–17While screening tools favour sensitivity at the expense of specificity, the implementation of poorly performing screening may fail to improve care for children with sepsis. In addition, oversensitive screening may jeopardise resource allocation to broader emergency department (ED) patient groups, and potentially favour unnecessary antibiotic usage.18 19In the state of Queensland, Australia, a statewide Sepsis Collaborative was launched in 2018 to address the priorities stated in the National Action Plan on sepsis.20This quality improvement programme incorporated a systematic sepsis screening tool embedded in a sepsis pathway designed specifically for children. We hypothesised that this screening tool would perform well to identify children with clinician-diagnosed sepsis. In addition, we aimed to derive a simplified screening tool for future application.MethodsMulticentre, prospective observational cohort study including children aged less than 18 years who were screened for sepsis on the paediatric sepsis pathway in EDs participating in the Queensland Sepsis Collaborative (online supplemental material 1). Details on this sepsis quality improvement programme have been published elsewhere.2110.1136/bmjopen-2022-061431.supp1Supplementary dataBriefly, the Queensland Sepsis Collaborative is an statewide quality improvement programme, with the aim to improve the recognition, treatment and outcomes of patients with sepsis in Queensland.22A dedicated paediatric sepsis pathway was designed in iterative multidisciplinary workshops incorporating evidence and information from published or online available paediatric sepsis tools.1 23 24The pathway consisted of a screening tool, a management tool and antimicrobial stewardship guidance. Paper printed pathways were distributed to the participating EDs, and clinicians were trained to manually enter data on the pathway sheets, which were collected with the patient charts. Data were then entered"

Data were then entered by trained ED nurses at the participating sites into the electronic case report form on REDCap hosted by Clinical Excellence Queensland, with regular auditing for data quality assurance. The sepsis pathway including the screening tool was implemented across 16 EDs in the state of Queensland, Australia, of which 12 contributed data for this project.We included children assessed between 4 August 2018 and 31 December 2019 who were screened for sepsis on the pathway. We excluded children with an interhospital transfer who were directly admitted to intensive care and children where no pathway had been used.Paediatric sepsis screening tool overviewThe screening portion of the paediatric sepsis pathway contained a total of 32 criteria, which were grouped into four sepsis screening blocks: (1) nine Sepsis Indicators (ie, triggers to screen), (2) six Sepsis Risk Factors, (3) eight Severe Illness Features and (4) nine Moderate Illness Features (online supplemental material 2). These 32 criteria were used as predictors for the analyses.Screening was initiated if the ED clinician (doctor or nurse, at triage or during initial assessment) suspected that the child may have sepsis, and/or the child met one or more of the Sepsis Indicator criteria. During screening, the treating clinician marked on the form if each of the specified criteria were present. Children who met any of the Severe or Moderate Illness Features were escalated to senior medical officer (SMO) review.OutcomeThe primary outcome was sepsis, defined as treatment for sepsis, which was operationalised by two criteria: (1) decision of the SMO that ‘sepsis is likely’ and (2) treatment with intravenous antibiotics in the ED. These criteria were chosen as they represent a pragmatic intention-to-treat cohort.25 26Children who were screened but who did not meet both of these criteria were classified as no sepsis. If a child was missing either of the two criteria for the outcome, namely, SMO review and antibiotics, it was assumed that these procedures were not performed, and these children were coded as no sepsis.Patient and public involvementDuring this project, the Queensland Sepsis Collaborative established a paediatric sepsis family group, which was represented as well at the Steering Group, and which contributed to workshops on the screening tool design and implementation. This led to the development of the Queensland Paediatric Sepsis Programme Family Support Structure.27Statistical analysis methodsDemographics and clinical characteristics were compared between those classified as sepsis and no sepsis. Continuous variables were not normally distributed, confirmed through visual inspection of the Q-Q plot, and as such the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. The χ2test or Fisher’s exact test (for low expected cell counts) were used for categorical variables. A p<0.05 was used to denote statistical significance for these comparisons. The number and"

The number and percentage of children with each criterion were reported to ascertain the prevalence of each criterion and the ϕ correlation coefficient (for dichotomous data) was calculated between all pairs of predictors to identify any predictors with high correlations that may result in multicollinearity problems. To examine the predictive performance of each of the sepsis screening blocks to identify children with sepsis, a separate multivariable logistic regression analysis for each screening block was initially undertaken and the ORs and 95% CIs were reported for each criterion within each block. The discriminative ability of each block to predict the outcome was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).To create the final prediction model, all 32 predictors were initially included in a logistic regression model and were iteratively removed using backward elimination, based on the largest reduction in the Akaike information criterion (AIC).28The final model was obtained when removing predictors no longer resulted in a reduction in the AIC. This final model was then internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Calibration of the predicted probabilities obtained through cross-validation was assessed by a calibration plot. The performance of the model was evaluated by the AUC, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of the model were reported at different risk thresholds, corresponding to Youden’s index, a sensitivity of 0.9 and a sensitivity of 0.85. Risk thresholds corresponding to high sensitivity rates were selected, as it is recommended that screening tests should prioritise sensitivity to reduce the false negative rate. A sensitivity analysis incorporating demographic and ED admission characteristics of gender, triage category, hospital category and admission time as adjustment variables in the final model was undertaken and evaluated by the AUC.Given previously reported challenges in defining paediatric sepsis,29we performed two sensitivity analyses on the final model where we tested the model’s performance when using the outcomes sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (children with sepsis as defined above, who met criteria for organ dysfunction within 24 hours of presentation to ED, as per the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Definition Consensus Conference30and septic shock (children with sepsis as defined above, who met criteria for septic shock within 24 hours of presentation to ED.30All modelling was performed using R (V.4.1.1)31and the code used to create the models are available online (https://github.com/TrishGilholm/Paediatric-Sepsis-Screening).

The final model consisted of 16 features (table 3): healthcare worker concern, ill appearance (‘looks sick’), altered behaviour, age <3 months, reduced immune defence, chronic disease, need for supplementary oxygen to maintain saturations, respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, increased lactate, altered level of consciousness measured by the Alert Voice Pain Unresponsiveness (AVPU) scale, non-blanching rash, hypothermia, prolonged capillary refill ≥3 s and cold extremities. The strongest associations (OR >2) were found for age <3 months, immunocompromised status, hypotension, increased lactate, non-blanching rash, hypothermia and cold extremities (table 3,online supplemental etable 1 and 2). The final model had better discrimination than the four separate blocks (AUC 0.80; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82) (table 3,figure 1), and retained similar predictive performance as the full 32-item model.Model performance and sensitivity analysesThe calibration plot displayed good agreement between predicted and observed probabilities (online supplemental efigure 3). To reach a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 87% to 92%), the final model reached a specificity of 51% (95% CI 49% to 53%) with a PLR of 1.83 (95% CI 1.75 to 1.92) and an NLR of 0.20 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.26) (online supplemental etable 3). Sensitivity analyses on children with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (n=210, 6.0%; AUC 0.84; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.87) and septic shock (n=146, 4.2%; AUC 0.84; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.88) confirmed the main findings (online supplemental etable 4).DiscussionIn this statewide prospective study, a paediatric sepsis screening tool performed well to identify children with sepsis in the ED. We identified the most discriminative criteria available from rapid patient history and vital sign assessments and derived a more parsimonious screening tool which yielded comparable predictive performance to the full 32-item screening tool. The tool has been implemented successfully across a range of paediatric and mixed EDs, and in principle can be digitalised for sites with electronic health records. The study thereby addresses a gap highlighted by the 2020 Surviving Sepsis Campaign paediatric guidelines, relating to the lack of evidence on best approaches to screening"

Due to the non-specific nature of presenting signs and symptoms of children with sepsis,35screening tools must be evaluated carefully, to enable recalibration and to avoid causing trigger or alarm fatigue.The criteria associated with sepsis included risk factors based on patient history (such as young infants or immunosuppressed patients), healthcare worker concern and features indicating likely organ dysfunction. Lactate as a rapidly available point of care laboratory value emerged as one of the strongest sepsis predictors, concurring with previous studies,36–38in addition to respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological criteria. Our findings are supported from a secondary analysis of a large trial in African children with infection, which revealed the importance of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological signs.39In agreement with our findings, Romaineet aldemonstrated that a modified score based on age-adjusted heart rate, respiratory rate, capillary refill and AVPU predicted ICU admission in febrile children.40Of note, most paediatric early warning scores (PEWS) incorporate similar features to our derived model.41 42However, the development and validation of PEWS primarily focused on sick children in ED rather than specifically on children with sepsis. Finally, the performance of our model is comparable to a weighted model to predict hypotensive septic shock in children which was derived from 2464 ED encounters, including 11.4% with shock, and which contains several similar features to our model, such as blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate and cancer as underlying disease.43Several limitations of this study need to be considered which limit the generalisability of the findings. First, data were only available on those patients where the screening tool was applied, and we did not have data on all ED admissions to estimate the degree of selection bias. While the indicator criteria (ie, triggers to screen) were designed to capture most children evaluated for infection, the diagnostic performance related to a clinician deciding to apply the screening tool to a patient was not assessed. Therefore, we cannot rule out that broad application of the screening tool to all comers in ED may yield substantially variable performance.

This challenge is magnified as there is no accepted gold standard of sepsis and there is inherent variability of ‘clinician-diagnosed sepsis’.44Second, the average acuity in the cohort was low, with only 1% admitted to intensive care and three deaths. As a result, our model may not have been powered to detect certain potentially relevant features that had low prevalence in our sample, and the study was not powered to analyse the impact on patient-centred outcomes. Third, although the primary outcome of clinician-diagnosed sepsis represents an intention-to-treat population,25 26 45clinicians were not blinded to the sepsis tool and the use of the tool may have influenced the diagnosis. To account for paediatric sepsis coding practices,29 46we performed sensitivity analyses which showed that the model performed well to identify children with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, and with septic shock, respectively. Fourth, the information captured by the screening tool was static, whereas clinicians may integrate dynamic information such as progression during initial ED observation, or response to treatment in their decision-making.19Finally, although the screening tool was tested in over 3000 paediatric patient encounters across 12 institutions, our findings require external validation. In particular, there is urgency to adapt and validate sepsis screening support tools for low-income and middle-income settings in the future.In conclusion, the findings from this multicentre study demonstrate reasonable diagnostic performance of a systematic screening tool to identify children with sepsis in the ED. While independent validation in other cohorts is required, our findings lend support for the use of systematic screening for sepsis as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. Future studies should investigate whether such tools assisting clinicians in ruling in or ruling out children in need of immediate treatment will result in improved patient outcomes.Supplementary MaterialReviewer commentsAuthor's manuscript"
