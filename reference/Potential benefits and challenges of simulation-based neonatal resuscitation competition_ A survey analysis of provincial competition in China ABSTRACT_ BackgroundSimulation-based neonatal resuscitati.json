Simulation-based competition (SBC), as an innovative derivative of neonatal resuscitation training, has been practiced recently but its potential effectiveness and challenges of competition are rarely studied. We tested the hypothesis that after SBC, participants could improve compliance with NRP® algorithm and teamwork, achieve lower stress and higher confidence in neonatal resuscitation.MethodsIn February 2023, 108 health care providers in 27 teams from different regional centres participated in provincial SBC. Each team consisted of 4 members (NICU physician [lead], NICU nurse, midwife and obstetrician). The teams were to complete a resuscitation scenario (16 min) and their performance was evaluated. All participants were encouraged to take part in a post-resuscitation questionnaire survey voluntarily immediately after the scenarios finished. Demographic characteristics and questionnaire results of participants were collected, including the confidence and perceived stress levels before and after the competition.ResultsNinety-eight (90.7%) participants completed the survey with 114 post-resuscitation questionnaire surveys. Participants perceived top benefits of SBC including improved compliance with NRP® algorithm, technical skills and teamwork, with the least benefit in improving self-confidence (vs. other benefits,P< 0.001). The confidence level did not change before and after the competition, whereas stress was reduced after the competition.ConclusionsParticipants in SBC might be benefited with improved compliance with NRP® algorithm, technical skills and teamwork. However, the impact, influence and sustainability of these benefits are uncertain. Further research is needed to explore ways to improve self-confidence and decrease stress in neonatal resuscitation. BODY: IntroductionMost neonates go through transition successfully from intrauterine to extrauterine environment. However, approximately 10% of infants need resuscitative interventions whereas 1% of neonates require extensive resuscitation.1,2,3,4Neonatal resuscitation is a high-pressure, high-risk process that can be stressful for providers5,6,7and is frequently associated with medical errors.6Although extensive resuscitation occurs not frequently in clinical work, it might cause significant stress on the providers and thus affect the performance. Furthermore, for successful neonatal resuscitation, it is essential to promptly identify perinatal risk factors and arrange team members with corresponding skills based on the risks.8The goal of neonatal resuscitation program (NRP®) is to ensure that there is at least one trained neonatal resuscitation provider at each delivery.1,9As a central"

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and challenges of SBC in HPs attending neonatal resuscitation SBC. We hypothesized that after SBC, HPs could improve compliance with NRP® algorithm and teamwork, achieve lower stress and higher confidence in neonatal resuscitation.MethodsStudy settingTo further emphasize the importance and improve quality of neonatal resuscitation, provincial SBC was organized by the Guangdong Medical Association, and conducted at the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH) on 28–29 February 2023. HKU-SZH is one of the “High Level − Summit Program” hospitals in the province of Guangdong. As the pilot hospital for high-quality development of public hospitals, HKU-SZH has adopted evidence-based practices and neonatal resuscitation workshops to provide training to NICU and obstetric staff in HKU-SZH since 2013 and to HPs nationwide as the regional simulation training center since 2016.Intervention: The provincial competition designPreparation:Regional and municipal training and competition: A total of 1,012 participants in 253 teams participated in the regional training and selection competition from May to August in 2022. Over 2,920 HPs from 319 hospitals participated in the regional neonatal resuscitation training. At preparation stage, the training and preliminary competition was conducted in seven cities respectively. The top 3–4 teams from 30 to 40 teams in each city advanced to the semi-finals. The scoring form was practical, including assessments of NRP® algorithm, technical skills and teamwork.

Before semi-finals, two meetings were held among assessors and facilitators to discuss scenarios and assessment criteria.Participants of studyA total of 108 HPs in 27 teams from different regional centres in the province of Guangdong participated in the competition. Each team consisted of 4 members (NICU physician [lead], NICU nurse, midwife and obstetrician). To promote and encourage participation of both obstetrical and neonatal HPs in neonatal resuscitation, all teams were homogeneous. The order of performance in the competition was determined by drawing lots. The participants worked as a team to complete a resuscitation scenario (16 min) and their performance including teamwork was evaluated by 6–8 assessors who were senior neonatologists in semi-final and final rounds of SBC. A generic assessment form was developed to evaluate the performance of neonatal resuscitation by the assessors. The assessment form followed the NRP® algorithm and was consistent with NRP® textbook and manual for instructors (Supplement). The participants were expected to ask questions to identify risk factors, predict possible actions, propose an appropriate plan, give clear role assignment and check equipment before delivery (4 min). After the simulated baby was born, the participants would perform appropriate resuscitation steps in the context of scenarios following the 2020 NRP® algorithm1with modifications for the context in China.19To ensure fairness, there was no immediate debriefing after each scenario and live broadcast was only opened to the participants who had completed the scenarios. The top ten teams advanced to the final round and were assessed by 8 assessors. Summary and feedback to each team was provided at the end of competition. To mitigate potential conflicts of interest, both assessors and participants came from different institutions who were also required to turn off the communication devices throughout the competition.Simulator:Laerdal® SimNewBTMhigh fidelity manikin and preterm Annie were used in the corresponding scenarios in simulation center.ScenariosThe scenarios were put in envelopes and were selected and revealed by each team leader immediately prior to SBC. Standardized parents or other relative staff also played a role in the scenario. The rationality of scenarios and evaluation criteria was discussed and revised among facilitators and assessors before competition.Scenario 1: maternal polyhydramnios with unknown antenatal history, a neonate of 40 weeks gestation had single umbilical artery and left congenital diaphragmatic hernia associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn.Scenario 2: maternal abdominal pain with rupture of the uterus, a neonate of 40 weeks gestation had no detectable heart rate at birth.Scenario 3: meconium-stained amniotic fluid and"

The completion of survey was absolutely voluntary with no effects of their evaluation results. For the possibly most important benefit of the SBC, six options were given including improving (1) compliance with NRP® algorithm, (2) teamwork, (3) technical skills, (4) clinical reasoning, (5) adaptability under stress and (6) self-confidence. The participants could choose at least one and at most three items from the options. The survey was conducted in a digital format with QR code to ensure privacy, confidentiality and anonymous personal details.Demographic characteristics and questionnaire results of participants were collected, including the confidence and perceived stress levels (in ten-point Likert scale) of participants before and after the competition.

In this observational study, the most important benefits from the SBC were improving compliance with"

    "full_text": "from the SBC were improving compliance with NRP® algorithm, technical skills and teamwork as perceived by the participants immediately after the competition.The high-fidelity, well-designed, SBC in neonatal resuscitation involving multi-disciplinary staff and standardized parents reproduced a variety of clinical scenarios of critically ill newborns and created a realistic state and atmosphere. The questionnaires were completed by participants from multiple centers immediately after finishing scenarios, with a high responding rate of 91%. The findings suggest that SBC could be a feasible novel format for neonatal resuscitation training.In neonatal resuscitation, clinical practice and training is basically guided by formal algorithms developed by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR).1However, the compliance is variable and often suboptimal with deviations in clinical practice from internationally recognized algorithms.6,20,21,22Further extensive resuscitation was associated with increased deviations from NRP® algorithms.6Gaps include but not limited to ineffective or unnecessary positive pressure ventilation, inappropriate oxygen use and failure to complete tasks within the allocated time.20Dissemination and implementation of guidelines is considered as one of strategies to improve adherence.20We speculate the possibly improved compliance and technical skills perceived by participants may be attributed to several aspects. First, through official organization of SBC by the Guangdong Medical Association, the importance of neonatal resuscitation and training was being strengthened by province-wide institutions and HPs within a relatively short period. This educational activity at provincial level was organized originally to aim at raising awareness of the guidelines, enhancing the importance of neonatal resuscitation among healthcare institutions and obstetric and pediatric medical staff to perform high-quality neonatal resuscitation. Secondly, the multiple training strategies before competition were based on updated NRP® and guidelines/recommendations and best practices in China. These strategies were implemented to enable participants’ adequate acquisition of cognitive, technical and non-technical skills. Thirdly, majority of participants (96.9%) had regular neonatal resuscitation training before the competition. We speculated that the frequency of practice before SBC increased in respective hospitals, although the detailed information was not recorded. Regular practice and drills are recommended and ideally the training should be repeated more frequently than once a year.23Given that deviations from the algorithm are frequent, our findings suggest SBC might facilitate the implementation of NRP® and national guidelines, especially during the phase after the guideline update.Improving teamwork is another important potential benefit according to participants. Indeed, both assessors and participants themselves had teamwork"

    "full_text": "and participants themselves had teamwork scored at means of 6.7 and 7.0 out of 10 points in the Likert scale, respectively, with only 32% and 47% of participants had > 80% scores, and this implies an area of improvement. Although each team member possesses knowledge and skills for neonatal resuscitation, individual abilities could not be optimized without effective collaboration and communication in teamwork.1Neonatal Resuscitation is stressful and sometimes unanticipated with limited time to prepare. Team members are not consistent and may indeed work together infrequently. Therefore, different HPs need to be integrated into teams. Teamwork facilitators include multidisciplinary team composition.24In our study, 70.5% participants expressed that they had collaborative simulation training with NICU and obstetric department. We believe that multidisciplinary teamwork training plays an important role in implementing neonatal resuscitation, improving understanding and communication among different HPs.There were four team members in each resuscitation in SBC. Although there is no single standard answer to the ideal number of providers in the resuscitation team, four or more people might be required for complex resuscitation.1The high proportion of female HPs was similar to the reality in neonatal and obstetrical units in China. Different from the resuscitation team including respiratory therapists in many north American centers,25NICU physician, midwife, NICU nurse and obstetrician are the members who often forms a team in delivery room in China. Midwife is frequently the first respondent managing the unexpected resuscitation within first minutes. In addition, the composition of neonatal resuscitation team is also dynamically changing due to staff rotation. During extensive resuscitation which occurs infrequently, obstetric staff are needed for alternative chest compression or other tasks. Moreover, in multidisciplinary training, obstetricians could understand the situation and outcomes of high-risk newborns and reflect on the management process of high-risk pregnant women thus probably improve the quality of obstetric and perinatal care. There was no significant difference in teamwork assessed between neonatologists and HPs participants, which indicated that the self-evaluation by participants was indeed reliable. A checklist including pre-resuscitation briefing, equipment, providers and corresponding tasks, post-resuscitation debriefing was found to be helpful to improve communication during neonatal resuscitation.26Interestingly, most teams in SBC performed briefing and debriefing, but none of them utilized the checklist, which should be emphasized in teamwork training.In this study, only 6% of participants considered improving self-confidence as an important benefit from SBC. This unexpected observation was consistent with the unchanged confidence levels of team leaders and members after SBC. In this survey, we did not ask the specific role of"

    "full_text": "this survey, we did not ask the specific role of participants during the scenario. We therefore only compared the confidence and stress levels of NICU physicians who presumably were the leaders in the scenarios and those levels of other team members (NICU nurses, obstetric physicians and midwives) but did not analyze the correlation between the role of participants and respective confidence or stress perception. In the analyses of confidence and stress perception in subgroups of participants who advanced to final competition or not, it is uncertain if the progress of scenario and results of competition may be related to the confidence and stress levels of participants. In addition to the competition format of SBC, the lack of confidence may reflect the absence of immediate debriefing after simulated scenarios. Debriefing provides participants with meaningful learning opportunities via experiential reflection, encouraging reflective learning and behavior change, without being judged.27,28The latter is important in adult learning. Effective debriefing allows providers to integrate the experience during scenario with the theoretical frameworks and the procedural guidelines. In the pre-competition training stage, debriefing was integrated after simulation, which took 2–3 times longer as much as that of scenarios. In the semi-final and final competition, debriefing was not performed immediately after scenarios and feedback was provided at the end of competition. We believe that structured debriefing might need to be implemented in SBC, and to improve self-confidence in future studies and training.The perceived stress was lower after the SBC but remained high in our study. Neonatal resuscitation is a time-critical and stressful event. In a randomized crossover study, the impact of observers significantly increased stress of providers when performing intubation on manikin.29The assessors, standardized parents and other staff in the scenarios might have the effect of observers causing stress to participants. However, the relationship between stress and performance is not linear but has an inverted-U-shape, indicating a moderate level of stress leads to better performance.30Individuals might have different limits and thresholds of stress. The complexity of scenarios varied, which might also have impacts on the perceived stress of the participants, and could be another source of bias. Future studies should explore and understand the factors that cause and alleviate stress in neonatal resuscitation.LimitationsOur study has several limitations. First, the perception of participants was survey-based subjective feelings. The results might be influenced by individual cognition and psychological resilience to stress. When designing questionnaires, we set certain options of potential benefits, which might lead to design bias.

Further for the comparison of self-confidence and stress level before and after scenario, it might be more reasonable to have surveys before and after the scenario which were not conducted for logistic reasons. Secondly, the environment and equipment in scenarios is similar with clinical settings but could not fully represent clinical settings. Limited conclusions can be drawn about its impact on clinical performance and patient outcome since the respective measurement is challenging. Thirdly, due to the design of SBC, the team who performed at the end in the competition had less opportunities for observing and learning from the performance of other teams. Furthermore, with the consideration of standard assessment, all scenarios were designed as extensive resuscitation with Airway-Breathing-Circulation-Drug steps or special considerations, causing some participants intentionally finish all steps. Further structured design implementing checklist and immediate debriefing, is expected to provide more evidence/information for sustainable and effective ways of neonatal resuscitation training. Despite the improvement in the compliance with NRP® algorithm, technical skills and teamwork as perceived by the participants after the SBC, it is uncertain if the beneficial effects are sustainable. A small number of participants had no previous simulation experience or did not participate in neonatal resuscitation regularly, and this might be considered as a potential bias to the results. Finally, it is uncertain regarding the dispersion and knowledge transfer of the benefits of participants to other HPs in the institutions before and during the SBC.ConclusionsParticipants in SBC might be benefited with improved compliance with NRP® algorithm, technical skills and teamwork. However, the impact, influence and sustainability of these benefits are uncertain.
