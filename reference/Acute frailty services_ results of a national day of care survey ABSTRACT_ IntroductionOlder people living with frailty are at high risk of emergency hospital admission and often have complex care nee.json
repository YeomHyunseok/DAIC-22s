This has driven the introduction of adaptations to acute care pathways designed to improve outcomes in this patient group. The identification of differences in the organisational approach to frailty may highlight opportunities for quality improvement.MethodsThe Society for Acute Medicine Benchmarking audit is a national service evaluation which uses a single day-of-care methodology to record patient and organisational level data. All acute hospitals in the United Kingdom are eligible to participate. Emergency admissions referred to acute medical services between 00:00 and 23:59 on Thursday 23rd June 2022 were recorded. Information on the structure and operational design of acute frailty services was collected. The use of a validated frailty assessment tool, clinical frailty scale within the first 24 h of admission, assessment by an acute frailty service and clinical outcomes were reported in patients aged 70 year and above. A mixed effect generalised linear model was used to determine factors associated same-day discharge without overnight stay in patients with frailty.ResultsA total of 152 hospitals participated. There was significant heterogeneity in the operational design and staffing model of acute frailty services. The presence of an acute frailty unit was reported in 57 (42.2%) hospitals. The use of validated frailty assessment tools was reported in 117 (90.0%) hospitals, of which 107 (91.5%) used the clinical frailty scale. Patient-level data were recorded for 3604 patients aged 70 years and above. At the patient level, 1626 (45.1%) were assessed using a validated tool during the admission process. Assessment by acute frailty services was associated with an increased likelihood of same-day discharge (adjusted OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.03- 2.39).ConclusionThere is significant variation in the provision of acute frailty services. Frailty-related policies and services are common at the organisational level but implemented inconsistently at the patient level. Older people with frailty or geriatric syndromes assessed by acute frailty services were more likely to be discharged without the need for overnight bed-based admission.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12877-024-05075-1. BODY: IntroductionFrailty is conceptualised as a state of vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors caused by changes in homeostasis related to ageing [1]. Frailty is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes following hospital admission, including mortality, increased length of stay and readmission [2–5]. Frailty is also associated with hospital acquired complications such as deconditioning, delirium, falls and pressure"

Estimates of the prevalence of frailty in contemporary studies of hospitalised adults vary between 30 and 60% based on the method of measurement and population included [2,8,9].A variety of tools and methods of assessment have been developed to identify frailty in the acute care setting [10,11]. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a validated frailty assessment tool which can be used to identify frailty using functional impairment as a surrogate marker [12]. The CFS was originally validated in the community setting but has since been widely applied in the acute hospital setting [13]. The use of CFS during the admission process may allow the early identification of patients likely to benefit from interventions, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) or continued inpatient care in specialist units [14,15]. CGA is a multidimensional assessment which highlights medical, social and functional needs and leads to the formulation of a patient-centred integrated care plan [16].The National Health Service (NHS) has recognised the potential benefits of a coordinated organisational response to frailty and has issued policy documents mandating the development of acute frailty services. The NHS Long Term Plan states that all hospitals with a Type 1 Emergency Department (ED) should provide an acute frailty service for at least 70 h a week [17]. Acute frailty services should be composed of a multi-disciplinary team capable of providing all domains of CGA. NHS England and NHS improvement (NHSE/I) have published additional guidance to support the implementation of acute frailty services alongside a series of metrics to measure performance [18]. The guidance states all patients over the age of 65 should be assessed using the CFS within 30 min of arrival to hospital. Recognition of severe frailty (CFS 7 to 9) should trigger assessment to diagnose the presence of co-existent geriatric syndromes within one hour and prompt consideration of end-of-life care. The guidance advocates early access to CGA as means to reduce the need for hospital admission and facilitate same-day discharge [18]. The recommendations do not specify how services should be configured locally. There is no consensus on the optimal configuration of acute frailty services. A systematic review of acute frailty services highlighted significant variation in the populations targeted, the interventions delivered and reported outcomes [19]. The relevant literature is dominated by single centre observational studies at high risk of bias.We aimed to describe variation in the operational approach to acute frailty across hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK). We quantified the prevalence of frailty assessment using validated frailty assessments tools at the organisational and patient level. Factors associated with same-day discharge were identified amongst a population of patients with frailty. This was achieved using the Society for"

This was achieved using the Society for Acute Medicine Benchmarking Audit (SAMBA), a national audit of acute medical care using a single day-of-care methodology [20,21].MethodsEthics approval and consent to participate.SAMBA is registered as a priority audit on the NHS England Quality Accounts list. All data is collected in the delivery of routine care. The North-West Wales Ethics Committee confirmed that the SAMBA did not require formal ethical review and formal consent from participants was not required. Participating sites register with the Society for Acute Medicine and follow local audit registration approval processes. Local Caldicot guardian approval is required to participate. No identifiable data is transferred from participating sites. Health Research Authority has been granted to allow secondary analysis on non-identifiable data (REC 21/HRA/4196).SAMBA methodologySAMBA is a cross-sectional service evaluation conducted by the Society for Acute Medicine annually on the penultimate Thursday in June. All hospitals in the UK receiving acutely unwell (non-elective, adult) medical patients are eligible to participate. Non-acute and community hospitals are excluded. The SAMBA22 protocol and data collection forms are publicly available [22]. Study reporting followed the Strengthening reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [23].SAMBA consists of two separate components completed by each participating hospital. An organisational survey was distributed to the designated SAMBA lead in each participating hospital one week prior to collection of patient level data. The survey contains questions relating to the organisational structure of acute frailty services, the range of services provided and their staffing model. The survey was completed by a locally designated SAMBA lead.Patient level data were collected on Thursday 23rd June 2022 between 00:00 and 23:59. All patients referred to acute medical services during the study period were eligible for inclusion. Data were collected electronically using a web-based data collection interface [24]. Patient level data were collected by named members of the acute medicine team. All variables were collected during the delivery of routine care and ascertained by retrospective review of the clinical record.The patient level evaluation contained multiple variables relevant to acute care for older people living with frailty. These included whether assessment using a validated frailty assessment tool had been recorded during the admission process and the outcome of the assessment (recorded as a dichotomous, frail vs non-frail based on the local threshold in operation). If CFS was not recorded during the admission process, it was determined by the data-collector using available information from the clinical records. Retrospective determination of CFS using case notes review has previously shown to have reasonable agreement with prospective determined values [25]. This"

The data collection tool provided data collectors with a visual guide to calculating CFS and explicitly stated the CFS should be calculated based on functional performance 2 weeks prior to admissions. SAMBA also recorded whether the patient had a geriatric syndrome (falls, cognitive impairment, delirium, new urinary incontinence) as a primary or contributory cause of admission [26]. Patient outcomes were recorded by review of the case notes or electronic health record at 14 days after admission.Organisational survey data and patient level data was used to describe variation in acute frailty service provision. The operational characteristics of acute frailty services, including eligibility criteria and staffing models were described. Patient level analysis relating to the prevalence of frailty assessment during the admission process was restricted to people aged ≥ 70. National guidelines recommend routine assessment for frailty in patients aged ≥ 65 [18]. SAMBA records age in 10-year bands which precluded assessment in this specific age range.A subgroup of patients with feature of frailty was defined to determine the relationship between acute frailty service review and same-day discharge. Criteria for the sub-group with features of frailty included CFS ≥ 5, the presence of a geriatric syndrome or both. In circumstances where the CFS and geriatric syndrome were unrecorded, receipt of a package of social care or residence in nursing or residential care was used as a proxy for frailty. Patients with a CFS < 5 and without a geriatric syndrome, or where both variables were unrecorded, not in receipt of a social package of care or residing in nursing or residential care were considered not to have frailty and were excluded from the sub-group analysis.MapsGeographical variation in the provision of acute frailty services was visualised using a series of maps. Boundary data was obtained from the Office of National Statistics geoportal to facilitate comparison between regions (Integrated Care Systems in England, local Health Boards in Scotland and Wales and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland. SAMBA participation rate was calculated using the number of hospitals with a Type 1 Emergency Department in each jurisdiction as the denominator. Maps were created in R studio using R statistical software (Version 4.1.2., Vienna. Austria). Geospatial files were manipulated using the geojsonio package.Statistical analysisContinuous data are described using the mean and standard deviation for normally distributed data and the median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed data.

Hospitals were incorporated as a random intercept to represent the hierarchical structure of the data. Age (in 10 years bands), arrival to hospital out of hours (between 20:00–07:59), initial assessment in a same-day emergency care area, the presence of a geriatric syndrome and the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were used as predictor variables in the model. NEWS2 values were dichotomised based on NEWS2 ≥ 4, which is used in national guidelines to prompt urgent assessment and consideration of escalation of clinical care and enhanced monitoring [27]. A NEWS2 ≤ 4 has been proposed as threshold at which same-day discharge may be considered appropriate in selected patients [27,28].The random intercept was used to obtain statistically valid co-efficient given the hierarchical clustered data structure but was also used to quantify variation at the hospital level [29]. To provide a more intuitive representation of variation between hospitals the random effects on the log-odd scale were converted to a median odds ratio (MOR) [30]. The MOR is the median value of the odds ratio (OR) of all possible pair-wise comparisons with the highest OR as the numerator in all pairs. Confidence intervals were created for the MOR using a parametric bootstrap technique using 1000 replicates. Fixed effect coefficients are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals calculated using a Wald test. The reported fixed effects are conditional on the random effect and represent the effect of the variable comparing patients from the same hospital rather than the average (marginal) effect. Generalised mixed effect models were implemented in the lme4 package using R statistical software (Version 4.1.2., Vienna. Austria).ResultsDescription of dataA total of 152 hospitals contributed to SAMBA22. The participation rate was 63.4% across all eligible UK hospitals.

SDEC: same day emergency care, NEWS2: National Early Warning Score 2DiscussionThis nationwide cross-sectional day of care of evaluation provides evidence of significant variation in the provision of acute services for older people living with frailty at the system level within the United Kingdom (UK). Our findings suggest a gap between the aspirations of national policy and the reality of clinical practice. The provision of acute frailty services is not universal and there are notable differences in the operational design and implementation of services at the hospital level. There also appears to be discordance between work as imagined, reflected in the organisational survey responses and the actuality of clinical practice. These observations may help guide quality improvement efforts and inform debate on the optimal configuration of acute frailty services. AFUs differ from traditional bed-based care by incorporating the principles of same-day emergency care to deliver earlier access to CGA and diagnostic services to reduce length of stay. Less than half of hospitals had access to a dedicated AFU.Assessment by acute frailty services was associated with an increased likelihood of same-day discharge amongst patients with frailty. The direction of causality cannot be inferred from our results. The possibility that acute frailty services were instrumental in achieving same-day discharge and the possibility that acute frailty services preferentially assess older people more likely to go home are both compatible with our observations.A recent randomised controlled trial of CGA delivered in the ED demonstrated a"

    "full_text": "trial of CGA delivered in the ED demonstrated a significant reduction in ED length of stay and reduced the need for hospital admission suggesting early intervention at the front door has a direct impact on outcome [31]. A narrow focus on same-day discharge as a metric of efficacy is not without risk.Services that target lower acuity patients in the pursuit of same-day discharge may inadvertently divert attention and resources from more complex patients with severe acute illness who stand to gain equally from multi-dimensional assessment and early rehabilitation.Our study highlights only a relatively small proportion of older people with frailty or presenting with geriatric syndromes are assessed by specialist acute frailty services. There is a mismatch between the number of older people living with frailty admitted with acute medical illness who may be expected to benefit from CGA and the provision of specialised acute frailty services. The ability to provide elements of CGA is not confined to clinicians working in acute frailty services and these observations highlight the need for non-specialists to incorporate elements of CGA into routine practice. Older people living with frailty admitted to hospital with acute medical illness experience delays in clinical assessment [32] and longer waiting times in the ED [33]. Studies that explore the indirect impact of acute frailty services on the care of older who do not meet the criteria for acute frailty service assessment and receive routine care by the acute and general medical team are required.Variation in the staff mix of acute frailty services and access to additional services suggest the organisational response to frailty may differ substantially between hospitals despite superficial similarities. There was significant variation in the likelihood of same-day discharge amongst patients with frailty between hospitals. Same-day discharge amongst older people with frailty was almost twice as likely on average (MOR 1.7) in pair-wise hospital comparisons. Whether differences in operational approach explain the observed variation is unclear. Older people living with frailty admitted to hospital for less than 72 h have comparable rates of emergency bed day use and survival to frail people admitted for longer periods [34]. Emergency admission of any length is therefore an adverse prognostic indicator in this group. It is vital that acute frailty services facilitating same-day discharge have access to enhanced community support, high quality rehabilitation services and the ability to undertake advance care planning in anticipation of future health crises [35,36].The number of hospitals incorporating frailty assessment tools into the admissions process at the policy level has increased from 62% in 2019 to 90% in the current study [37]. This has not been accompanied by an increase in the proportion of patients assessed at the patient level. Less than half of patients deemed at risk of frailty by age"

    "full_text": "half of patients deemed at risk of frailty by age criteria are assessed at the patient level. This is consistent with previous estimates of the prevalence of frailty assessment on admissions suggesting the presence of unaddressed barriers to implementation [37]. Given we used an age threshold of 70 to define the population at risk this is likely to represent an overestimate of performance relative to national guidelines which recommend assessment for the presence of frailty in all patients 65 years old or above.In the patient group not assessed using a validated tool during the admission more than 1 in 3 had a CFS ≥ 5 and 1 in 3 had a geriatric syndrome. This suggests an opportunity to systematically identify and quantify the severity of frailty at earlier time points in the acute care pathway is frequently missed. There is a robust evidence base which shows frailty assessment tools are good predictors of adverse outcomes including mortality, length of stay and the need for institutional care during and following emergency admission to hospital [4]. It is less clear how best to utilise this information to optimise the acute care process [13,38]. Frailty assessment tools are not inherently useful and increasing the documentation of frailty assessment on admission should not be pursued as an objective for its own sake. Knowledge of the frailty status of a patient within the first 24 h of admission may provide an additional prompt to offer evidence-based interventions such as CGA [15,39]. More consistent use of CFS may facilitate improved communication of the severity of underlying frailty in a simple and understandable way across care interfaces. The correlation between the proportion of older people assessed using a validated assessment tool on admission and assessment by acute frailty services within each hospital was weak. This suggests improved implementation of frailty screening does not directly translate to earlier specialist input. CFS is commonly used to select patients who may benefit from acute frailty service input, but CFS used in isolation identifies a population which greatly surpasses the current capacity of acute frailty service provision. This prompts questions as to whether the CFS is optimised to select patients who may benefit from acute frailty services on admission and whether more nuanced approaches to patient selection are used in practise.Strengths and limitationsThe hospital participation rate in SAMBA22 allows a reasonable assessment of acute care delivery at the national scale. Around three quarters of hospitals in England contributed data, participation was lower in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The cross-sectional single day of care methodology employed in SAMBA has significant limitations. Case-mix adjustment was limited to crude measures of severity of illness and did not include detailed information in relation to diagnosis. Performance measured over a single day is likely to vary substantially at the"

This risk of overstating variation was mitigated by aggregating hospitals within a mixed effect model. The magnitude of variation would be expected to decrease in a larger sample collected longitudinally. Acute frailty service assessment was associated with a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of same-day discharge, although there were wide confidence intervals around the estimate.SAMBA is conducted as a service evaluation. This allows rapid data collection at scale at the expense of an increase in the risk of measurement error in comparison with a formalised observational study. Organisational survey responses were provided by a single individual at each participating hospital. There may have been systemic differences in how key variables such as CFS and the presence of geriatric syndromes were recorded between participating hospital. Organisational and patient level data contained missing variables. The CFS variable was omitted relatively frequently which precluded its use to define a population with frailty in isolation. Where relevant, outcomes are reported in the patient group with missing CFS values separately. There may be systemic differences between SAMBA participating and non-participating hospitals which may limit generalisation.ConclusionThere is significant variation in the provision of acute frailty services. Frailty related policies and services are common at the organisational level but implemented inconsistently at the patient level. Older people with frailty or geriatric syndromes assessed by Acute frailty services were more likely to be discharged without the need for overnight bed-based admission. It is unclear whether this reflects preferential selection of patients at higher likelihood of discharge or a direct effect of the intervention. Further research is required to evaluate the impact of frailty assessment and acute frailty services to help define features which drive improved clinical outcomes.Supplementary InformationSupplementary Material 1."
