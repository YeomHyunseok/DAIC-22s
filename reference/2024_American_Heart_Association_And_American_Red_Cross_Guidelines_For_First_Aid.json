Lavonas, MD, MS; on behalf of the American Heart Association and American Red Cross\n\nABSTRACT: Codeveloped by the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross, these guidelines represent thefirst comprehensive update of first aid treatment recommendations since 2010. Incorporating the results of structuredevidence reviews from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, these guidelines cover first aid treatment forcritical and common medical, traumatic, environmental, and toxicological conditions. This update emphasizes the continuousevolution of evidence evaluation and the necessity of adapting educational strategies to local needs and diverse communitydemographics. Existing guidelines remain relevant unless specifically updated in this publication. Key topics that are new, aresubstantially revised, or have significant new literature include opioid overdose, bleeding control, open chest wounds, spinalmotion restriction, hypothermia, frostbite, presyncope, anaphylaxis, snakebite, oxygen administration, and the use of pulseoximetry in first aid, with the inclusion of pediatric-specific guidance as warranted.\n\nKey Words: AHA Scientific Statements ◼ American Heart Association ◼ emergencies ◼ first aid ◼ Red Cross ◼ wounds and injuries\n\n1. General care and safety: The first aid providershould provide care within their skill and knowl-edge set, seeking further medical care as needed,and be mindful of their own safety.2. First aid for bleeding: When faced with life-threatening bleeding, the first aid provider shouldapply direct pressure followed by application of atourniquet or wound packing if the location of thewound is amenable.3. First aid for chest pain: In adults with acute chestpain, it is recommended that emergency medicalservices be activated to initiate transport to theclosest emergency department. While awaitingthe arrival of emergency medical services, first aidproviders may encourage alert adults experienc-ing nontraumatic chest pain to chew and swallow\n\naspirin (162–325 mg) unless the person expe-riencing pain has a known aspirin allergy or hasbeen advised by a health care professional not totake aspirin.4. First aid for stroke: The use of a stroke recog-nition scale such as Face, Arms, Speech, Timeis recommended to aid in the recognition ofacute stroke in adults and may also be used asan adjunct in pediatrics, although it is not vali-dated in that setting and should not solely beused to identify the broad presentation of strokein children."

First aid for tick bites: First aid providers shouldremove an attached tick as soon as possible bygrasping the head of the tick as close to the skinas possible with tweezers or a commercial tickremoval device and pulling upward with steady,even pressure.9. First aid for seizure: First aid providers shouldactivate emergency medical services for first-timeseizures; seizures lasting >5 minutes; multiple sei-zures without return to normal; seizures in water;seizures with injuries, breathing difficulty, or chok-ing; seizures in infants zures in pregnant individuals or if the person doesnot return to baseline mental status within 5 to 10minutes after seizure activity stops.10. Oxygen and pulse oximetry use in first aid: It isreasonable for first aid providers to use pulseoximetry results as part of a complete assessmentof an ill or injured person and in consideration ofthe many limitations of pulse oximeters. First aidproviders should be aware of the potential harmsof administration of supplemental oxygen in indi-viduals with known chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease and should not provide oxygen over anoxygen saturation of 92%."

The last comprehensive review of AHA/Red Cross first aid recommendations was published in2010,2 with updates focused on specific topics publishedin 2015,1 2019,5 and 2020.6 The recommendationsin this document are derived from that work, evidenceevaluations from the ILCOR First Aid Task Force,7–11 andstructured evidence evaluations performed by the writ-ing group.\n\nFirst aid is defined as “helping behaviors and initial careprovided for an acute illness or injury.”1 First aid can beprovided by anyone, including the ill or injured person(self-care), nearby individuals, and trained rescuers witha duty to respond (eg, lifeguards). The scope of first aidprovided is based on the first aid provider’s level of train-ing, available equipment and resources, overall scenario,and need. First aid competencies include, at any level oftraining, the following:\n\n• Recognizing, assessing, and prioritizing the need forfirst aid;• Providing care by using appropriate knowledge,skills, and behaviors; and• Recognizing limitations and seeking additional carewhen needed.1\n\nThese guidelines are intended to apply to commonresidential, workplace, and recreational settings. In gen-eral, first aid care begins when the first aid providerbegins to assess and assist the ill or injured personand continues until the condition no longer requiresurgent intervention, emergency medical services (EMS)professionals arrive, or the person arrives at definitivehealth care (eg, a hospital, urgent care facility, or doc-tor’s office)."

These searches were executed inMedline and the Excerpta Medica Database (Embase)using the Ovid search interface and the Cochrane Cen-tral Register of Controlled Trials. ILCOR evidence re-views published since 2015 were reviewed, and thedates of updated searches were harmonized with thesereviews to avoid search overlap. Search results werenot limited by language or year as long as an Englishlanguage abstract was available. Final searches wereexecuted in February through December 2023. Struc-tured searches were supplemented by bibliography re-view and ad hoc searches when needed. Search resultswere imported into Covidence (Covidence systematicreview software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne,Australia; https://covidence.org).

Peoplemay require first aid care for a few minutes or many hours,and not all scenes are safe. First aid providers vary in age,physical ability, level of acquired and retained skill, andwillingness and ability to act. No single set of guidelinescan encompass all scenarios. The philosophical principles\n\nof beneficence, nonmaleficence, and autonomy areapplicable: The first aid provider should assist the ill orinjured person as much as possible, avoid causing harm,and respect the right of a person who is alert and ca-pable of decision-making to accept or refuse care.1\n\nFirst aid recommendations do not include actions thatlegally can be performed only by a health care profes-sional or those actions that require specialized trainingor equipment. In some cases, a first aid provider mayhave specialized training and a duty to respond; com-mon examples include lifeguards and members of indus-trial emergency response teams. Local and institutionalprotocols and the tenets of advanced training supersedegeneral first aid recommendations.\n\nThese guidelines assume that a first aid provider hasaccess to common household items and nonprescrip-tion medications but does not have access to specializedmedical equipment or monitoring tools. In addition, theyare assumed to apply to settings where access to EMSand higher levels of medical care are readily available.Recommendations may need to be altered or amendedin rural, wilderness, and other low-resource settings.\n\nThe first aid provider can improve and empower theirresponse through training and preparation, including main-taining a first aid kit and preparing for setting and activity-related responses such as in the home, at the beach, orwhile backcountry skiing. The Red Cross’ recommendedfirst aid kit content list is detailed in Tables 2 and 3. Thefirst step in the first aid response is to assess the scenefor hazards and threats and to take actions to protectoneself, such as using personal protective equipment(PPE). There can be ambiguity in emergencies, and it canbe difficult to determine whether help is needed. Decid-ing to act is the most important first step in the provisionof first aid.\n\nThe person who may be ill or injured should beassessed with the standard systematic approach taughtin a first aid course. First aid providers should assessthe ill or injured person by checking for responsive-ness, breathing, and potential injuries. Any abnormalitiesin responsiveness or breathing and any major injuriesshould be viewed as an emergency and should promptactivation of EMS.\n\nSigns of a first aid emergency requiring professionalassistance include (but are not limited to) the following:"

Ifthe person is unresponsive or the parent or guardian ofa minor is not present, consent to treatment is implied. Acalm voice and approach can reduce the person’s fear andanxiety. This also allows the first aid provider to determinewhether the person is awake and responsive to voice andverbal commands. If the ill or injured person can talk or crynormally, it may be assumed that their airway is open andtheir breathing is adequate. The first aid provider shouldcommunicate with the ill or injured person, explainingwhat they are doing to help and acting with respect andempathy. Many people with underlying health conditionswill wear medical alert jewelry (typically a bracelet or pen-dant). The first aid provider should quickly look for this tohelp guide initial evaluation and treatment.\n\nIn many cases, an ill or injured person with a normalalertness and responsiveness may be left in the positionin which they are most comfortable (usually the position inwhich they are found) unless there is a need to move themto a different location or position for safety reasons or tofacilitate treatment. First aid providers may assess an ill orinjured person by asking them questions to determine theirmental status or medical history or by more closely examin-ing part of their body (after obtaining consent). The first aidprovider should activate EMS as soon as they determinethat help is needed. Emergency telecommunicators (911dispatchers or 911 call takers) can be a valuable sourceof help in directing first aid actions. If first aid provider isusing a mobile phone, they should provide care to the ill orinjured person while talking to the emergency dispatcherby activating the phone’s speaker function.\n\nNot having first aid equipment is not a barrier to pro-viding first aid.

Education on and demonstrationof how to perform hand hygiene and to safely put on,take off, and dispose of PPE are integral parts of riskreduction and should be included in all first aid educa-tion programs.\n\nProviding first aid requires special consideration of theunique cultures, experiences, and characteristics of peo-ple and communities. Special consideration may be ben-eficial for the following groups.\n\nNeonates (days and 1 year of age): Care must be gentle andspecialized, with attention to the fragility of their smallsize. Techniques such as infant cardiopulmonary re-suscitation (CPR) require specific knowledge andhandling.\n\nChildren (1 year of age–beginning of puberty): Com-munication might be challenging; attempt to calm themand possibly engage their caregiver. Age-appropriatetechniques and equipment are essential. Beginning ofpuberty is defined by appearance of breast buds in girlsand axillary hair in boys."

    "full_text": "Teaching Methodology\n\nAlthough there is a lack of extensive RCTs, the combi-nation of health science educational best practices andobservational and quasi-experimental studies in first aideducation provides a solid foundation for these recom-mendations. The teaching methodology of first aid iscrucial. The “Learn, See, Practice, Prove, Do, Maintain”framework proposed by Sawyer et al6 incorporates vari-ous educational concepts from procedural learning,6 sim-ulation,7 and resuscitation science.8 This model beginswith learning, ideally through multimedia resources, fol-lowed by real-life demonstrations (seeing). These stepsrepresent a “flipped classroom” model, enhancing ad-vanced learning tasks in the presence of a teacher andpeers.9 Deliberate practice combines appropriate trainingfrequency,10 low-risk practice environments,11 and directobservation for feedback.12,13 Proving involves using validand reliable assessments to ensure effective learningoutcomes.14 For instance, a first aid provider certificate\n\nshould indicate a learner’s ability to positively affect pa-tient outcomes.15 Maintaining the ability to perform firstaid skill sets independently requires intermittent skill re-freshers, also called spaced learning.16,17,18 No education-al effort perfectly integrates all aspects of the Learn, See,Practice, Prove, Do, Maintain framework, but it serves asa comprehensive guide for educators planning first aidtraining, covering content, teaching methods, and evalu-ation strategies.19,20\n\nA crucial aspect of education delivery is understand-ing local needs before implementing an intervention.20Community engagement helps tailor the content such asprioritizing anaphylaxis education in schools that have ahistory of related emergencies or focusing on naloxoneadministration training for people who are most likely towitness an opioid emergency.21–25 Programs like Stopthe Bleed have gained traction partly because of theirrelevance to societal issues like mass shootings in Amer-ica.26 First aid educators should also focus on communi-ties with historically poor medical outcomes attributableto lack of prior efforts for dedicated first aid education.5\n\nAfter the appropriate first aid topics are selected,decisions on the target audience, educators, additionalteaching strategies, and evaluation methods are made.20Schools and other community institutions are key ven-ues for universal first aid education. Even young childrenin schools should be included because they are capableof performing essential first aid tasks.27 A collaborativeapproach in which first aid experts and community lead-ers work together in a train-the-trainer model is ideal.28This approach not only facilitates initial learning but alsosupports ongoing training refreshers.17 Various methods,including discussions, simulations, and technologicalinnovations such as CPR feedback devices29 and poten-tial future use of virtual/augmented reality platforms,30enhance the learning experience."

Although the recovery position has been thesubject of little formal study, its anticipated benefits are tomaintain an open airway, prevent aspiration, and providestability and comfort.1 However, the recovery position maynot be ideal if there are injuries to the spine, hip, or pelvis;if breathing is abnormal; or if CPR is needed."

If a person requires CPR or rescue breathing (ie, is unresponsive with absent or abnormal breathing), the first aid provider should position the person supine and follow the CPR algorithm.1C-EO2. A first aid provider who is assisting a person with a potentially serious illness or injury should immediately activate the emergency response system.1C-EO3. A first aid provider who is assisting a person with a potentially serious illness or injury should remain with the person until trained rescuers arrive as long as it is safe to do so.1C-EO4. If the area is unsafe, the first aid provider should move an ill or injured person to a safe location if possible and safe for the first aid provider to do so.1C-EO5. If a person has been injured, is responsive, and is breathing normally and the nature of the injury suggests a neck, back, hip, or pelvic injury, the person should be left in the position in which they were found to avoid potential further injury unless the area is unsafe.1C-EO6. An awake and alert person who is having difficulty breathing should be allowed to assume a position most comfortable for breathing, which will be sitting up in most situations.1C-EO7.

To provide effective first aid care, a provider needsto recognize whether the setting is safe to assessor deliver medical assistance.35. Although studies about moving an injured personin the first aid setting could not be identified, priorfirst aid guidelines have recommended that a per-son with suspected injuries to the neck, back, hip,or pelvis remain in their original position to avoidworsening the injury (eg, worsening hemorrhage orneurological injury).8,96. It is presumed that a person who is alert willchoose a position that optimizes their ability tobreathe and avoids airway obstruction. No stud-ies were identified that directly address this. Asystematic review evaluated the effect of lat-eral position compared with other body posi-tions on mortality, morbidity, and clinical adverseevents in critically ill adults. The review authorscould not identify one best position because ofthe lack of evidence in the included studies.10Encouraging individuals with difficulty breathingto assume a position of comfort is widely recom-mended.11–15 Studies of adults with heart failureor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease foundimproved respiratory mechanics when patientswere allowed to assume a sitting-up position.16,17A systematic review on the influence of bodyposition on lung function in healthy individualsand specific patient groups found that in healthyindividuals and patients with lung, heart, or neu-romuscular diseases or obesity, lung functionparameters such as forced expiratory volume andvital capacity were generally higher in more erectpositions.187.

It is potentially harmful for first aid providers to administer supplementary oxygen to a person with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to an oxygen saturation >92%.\n\n1. A 2022 ILCOR scoping review did not identify anystudies on the effectiveness of oxygen therapyin the first aid setting.1 The ILCOR First Aid TaskForce concluded that there is no direct evidenceto support or not support the use of oxygen by firstaid providers in the first aid setting. No evidencewas found about whether people with specificconditions such as drowning, carbon monoxidepoisoning, decompression illness, or pneumoniawould benefit from oxygen administration in thefirst aid setting. Although there are specific con-ditions for which oxygen administration by healthcare professionals or specially trained rescuers hasbeen proven beneficial, particularly when guided byreliable pulse oximetry, the overarching message isthat a role for oxygen administration in general firstaid has not been established.2. An ILCOR 2020 systematic review on oxygen foracute stroke did not identify a benefit of oxygenover room air for survival or neurological outcome.2A single observational study in the prehospital set-ting3 provided direct evidence from the prehospitalsetting, supported by 8 RCTs from the in-hospitalsetting. These studies compare the use of supple-mentary oxygen with varying flow rates and deliv-ery methods with no use of supplementary oxygen(ie, room air) in individuals with acute stroke. Thesestudies failed to find a benefit for critical outcomessuch as survival, favorable neurological outcomes,and quality of life.3. One study and a Cochrane systematic review iden-tified by the task force enrolled 214 adults withchronic obstructive pulmonary disease receivingtreatment by paramedics en route to the hospi-tal. The study observed a reduction in mortality infavor of the group in whom oxygen was titrated tomaintain pulse oximetry of 92% compared with thegroup receiving high-flow oxygen (2 deaths in thetitrated oxygen group compared with 11 deaths inthe high-flow control arm; risk ratio, 0.22 [95% CI,0.05–0.97]; 214 participants).4,5"

Assessment of respiratory statusincludes observing for bluish discoloration of theface, lips, or nails; abnormal respiratory rate andeffort; cough; a sensation of dyspnea; restless-ness and discomfort; chest pain or tightness; andincreased heart rate. Interpretation of any numeri-cal value provided by a pulse oximeter mustinclude considering these and other potentialassessment findings.2. Pulse oximeters have numerous limitations. Pulseoximeter accuracy can be affected by manypatient, device, and environmental factors.

Stroke is a serious and time-sensitive medicalemergency. Emergency interventions are mosteffective when delivered promptly. Use of EMS bypatients with stroke has been associated with ear-lier ED arrival, quicker ED evaluation, more rapidtreatment, and more eligible patients receivingintervention.5,6 For the best outcomes possible, rec-ognition and activation of the stroke care systemshould occur as quickly as possible.2. A 2020 ILCOR systematic review3 evaluated 9different screening tools reported in 19 observa-tional studies. The FAST,7 which is essentially iden-tical to the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale,was the only tool intended for administration bylaypeople (Figure 3). The FAST and the CincinnatiPrehospital Stroke Scale have the same 3 physi-cal examination items (face, arms, and speech),which the review authors identified as appropriate\n\nfor use by first aid providers. Although data spe-cific to first aid providers are lacking, the use ofstroke scales coached by EMS dispatchers andby EMS personnel improves early recognition ofstroke.9,103. If a first aid provider has the necessary knowledgeand equipment to perform capillary blood glucosemeasurement, the measurement of blood glucosemay aid in ruling out hypoglycemia, a commonstroke mimic."

Chest pain is a common healthproblem with multiple causes, ranging from minor chestwall strains to pneumonia or myocardial infarction (heartattack). It can be difficult to differentiate chest pain ofcardiac origin such as a heart attack from chest pain ofother origins.1 The prevalence of myocardial infarction inpatients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chestpain varies by age, ranging from ≈1% in patients 18 to44 years of age to 4% in patients ≥80 years of age.2 In-dividuals with chest pain often delay seeking care, lead-ing to poor outcomes.3,4 Common signs and symptomsassociated with a heart attack include chest pain or pres-sure, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or pain in thejaw, arm(s), or back.\n\nThe most important action for a person experienc-ing chest pain or other symptoms that might indicate amyocardial infarction is to activate EMS. Aspirin in thedose of 162 to 324 mg improves survival in patientswith myocardial infarction.5,6 A 2020 systematic reviewfound that early or first aid administration of aspirin toadults with nontraumatic chest pain was associatedwith reduced mortality.7 The rate of major complica-tions associated with administration of a single doseof aspirin to an individual experiencing chest painappears to be low, but certain individuals may have anallergy to aspirin or a bleeding risk, or they may havebeen advised by a health care professional not to takeaspirin.8"

Signs and symptoms ofanaphylaxis include lip and facial swelling, a sensationof the throat closing, difficulty breathing, rash, vomitingor diarrhea, and symptoms of low blood pressure suchas changes in level of consciousness, pallor, and dizzi-ness. The mainstay of immediate treatment for anaphy-laxis is intramuscular epinephrine, typically administeredin the first aid setting with an epinephrine autoinjector.Epinephrine autoinjectors are often prescribed to peoplewith a history of anaphylaxis to self-administer at the firstsign of an anaphylactic reaction. First aid providers aresometimes called on to assist people experiencing ana-phylaxis as they self-administer this medication. In manycases, this will significantly improve or resolve the per-son’s symptoms, but sometimes additional epinephrineis required.\n\nILCOR performed scoping reviews related to anaphy-laxis in 2019 and 2022.1,2 An updated literature searchwas performed by the writing group in 2023.\n\nFirst Aid for Anaphylaxis\n\nCORLOERecommendations1B-NR1.

If a person experiences anaphylaxis, the emer- gency response system should be activated.2bB-NR4. If a person with anaphylaxis does not respond to the initial dose of epinephrine and arrival of EMS will exceed 5 to 10 minutes, a repeat dose may be considered.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1. Strong international consensus, based primarilyon observational data, endorses early administra-tion of intramuscular epinephrine given in the lat-eral thigh as the primary treatment of anaphylaxisregardless of the triggering agent.3–112. A person experiencing anaphylaxis may be unableto access or manipulate their autoinjector becauseof respiratory distress, hypotension, or alteredmental status. First aid providers may assist theill person. Epinephrine is typically injected into themuscle of the lateral thigh.3–123. Approximately 500 to 1000 people die in theUnited States of anaphylaxis each year.13 In addi-tion to intramuscular epinephrine, patients withanaphylaxis may require endotracheal intuba-tion, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and otheradvanced treatments to survive.\n\n4. It is estimated that between 7% and 18% ofpeople with anaphylaxis require >1 dose of epi-nephrine.14,15 Most patients who required a seconddose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis improved afteradministration.2 One study found that patients whoreceived a second dose of epinephrine were morelikely to be admitted to the hospital than thosereceiving 1 dose, although this appeared to be dueto severity of illness rather than an adverse effectof epinephrine.16"

Seizures can occur as a result ofinfections, trauma, poisonings, lack of oxygen, meta-bolic abnormalities (hypoglycemia), fevers (in children),and underlying neurological conditions such as epi-lepsy. Febrile seizures occur in 2% to 4% of children,most commonly between 6 months and 2 years of age.Generalized tonic-clonic seizures affect large areas orboth sides of the brain and manifest as full-body rhyth-mic jerking with alterations in consciousness. Focalseizures affect only 1 area of the brain and can pres-ent as jerking of only 1 extremity or 1 side of the body,abnormal facial movements, small repetitive move-ments, or staring spells (focal impaired awareness),with or without changes in consciousness. Some focalseizures will progress to generalized seizures. Urinaryincontinence may also occur during a seizure. Seizureduration can be seconds to hours. Most seizures arefollowed by a postictal period in which the person ap-pears tired and confused for several minutes.

Syncopecauses a considerable medical and socioeconomicburden on the adult population, resulting in 2% to 6%of hospital admissions internationally and accountingfor at least $2.4 billion in annual hospital costs in theUnited States.3–5\n\nThere are many causes of syncope. Vasovagal syn-cope and orthostatic syncope result in 21.2% and 9.4%of syncopal episodes, respectively.6 However, syncope\n\nalso may have more dangerous causes such as cardiacdysrhythmia. Vasovagal syncope is preceded by prodro-mal symptoms in about two-thirds of cases.7 Presyn-cope is the prodrome of syncope that may last for a fewseconds and may include lightheadedness or dizziness,blurry or tunnel vision, nausea, a sensation of warmth,and signs such as diaphoresis and pallor. This prodromerepresents a short time in which a first aid interventionmay be used to prevent syncope. Physical counterpres-sure maneuvers (PCMs) are a first aid intervention dem-onstrated to help prevent syncope.8,9 PCMs include thecontraction of muscles of the body such as those in thelegs, arms, abdomen, or neck, causing a rise in bloodpressure and alleviating symptoms of near syncope orig-inating from vasovagal or orthostatic causes8,9 (Table 9).\n\nThe ILCOR performed a systematic review of first aidinterventions for presyncope in 2020,11 with an evidenceupdate in 2022.12 An updated literature search was per-formed by the writing group in 2023.\n\nMethodDescriptionIllustrationLower-body PCMsLeg crossing with muscle tensingLeg crossing with tensing of the leg, abdominal, and buttock muscles while lying down or, if neces- sary, while standingSquattingLowering the body into a squatting position.

If a person experiences signs or symptoms of presyncope (including pallor, sweating, lightheadedness, visual changes, and weakness) of vasovagal or orthostatic origin, that person should maintain or assume a safe position such as assisted sitting or lying down.2aC-LD2. Once the person with presyncope is in a safe position, it can be beneficial for that person to use physical PCMs to avoid syncope.2bC-LD3. Lower-body PCMs may be preferable to upper-body and abdominal PCMs in first aid for presyncope.2bC-EO4.

The use of PCMs is not recommended when symptoms of a heart attack or stroke accompany presyncope.\n\n1. Physical injuries are frequent complications of syn-cope, occurring in ≈30% of patients admitted toEDs, of whom ≈5% experience severe trauma.3Therefore, the initial goal of presyncope treatmentshould be to assume a safe position to decreasethe risk of trauma.2. A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials demon-strated an ≈50% reduction in the risk of syncopewhen PCMs were used compared with no inter-vention.9 Although no studies directly assessedthe ability of first aid providers to instruct a per-son with presyncope on PCMs in real time, inseveral studies, researchers were able to effec-tively instruct research participants on the use ofPCMs before an intervention (eg, tilt table test)or for the treatment of presyncope in the real-world setting.13–173. An observational study enrolling 27 participantswith recurrent vasovagal syncope demonstratedbetter improvements in heart rate and a lower like-lihood of syncope with the use of lower-body PCM(squatting with leg crossing) compared with upper-body PCM (handgrip).8,184. In studies involving tilt-table testing, PCMs wereable to improve cardiovascular parameters, reduceor eliminate symptoms of presyncope, and pre-vent syncope within seconds of implementing thePCM.14,15,19 In a tilt table study of people with vaso-vagal syncope, continuously applied PCMs werebeneficial for at least 2 minutes.155.

Larger local reactions and anaphylaxis may occur.Stinging bees, wasps, and hornets result in ≈60 deathsper year in the United States.1 Most deaths are due toanaphylaxis, a severe reaction that may include rapid de-velopment of difficulty breathing, tongue or throat swell-ing, lightheadedness (a possible symptom of low bloodpressure), vomiting, and disseminated hives. Death canalso occur from massive envenomation, generally fromat least 20 stings by large hornets or hundreds of stingsfrom honeybees.2–4\n\nThe honeybee has a barbed stinger that often remainsin the skin after the sting and can continue to delivervenom for up to 60 seconds.5 Other species of bees,wasps, and hornets have smooth stingers and can stingmultiple times.\n\nMany people with a history of anaphylaxis have epi-nephrine autoinjectors, which they are instructed toself-administer at the first sign of anaphylaxis. First aidproviders may be called on to assist people experienc-ing anaphylaxis to self-administer this medication.3,6,7Intranasal and sublingual formulations of epinephrinefor the treatment of anaphylaxis were not available inthe United States or Canada at the time of guidelinedevelopment.\n\nTreatment for local reactions to bee and wasp stingsis intended to reduce local symptoms of pain, swelling,and itching at the site of the sting."

Several clinical trials found that a single dose ofprophylactic doxycycline given within 72 hoursafter an Ixodes scapularis tick bite could preventLyme disease.6–8 Doxycycline prescribing requirestreatment by a health care professional. Althoughthe risk is decreased, some people develop Lymedisease despite receiving prophylactic doxycycline,and additional treatment is required.2. The risk of infection from tick-borne illnessincreases with the time of tick attachment(Figure 4). Although the risk of contracting a tick-borne illness appears to be more substantial if the\n\ntick is attached for >24 to 48 hours, the tick shouldbe removed as soon as possible to minimize therisk of infection2,9,10 (Figure 5).3. The risk of damaging tick mouthparts appears tobe lower when health care professionals removeticks with tweezers compared with laypeopleremoving ticks by hand.12 In tick removal by der-matologists, successful removal was most com-mon when tweezers were used to grasp the ticknear the mouthparts compared with lasso andtraction devices, card slit devices, and freezing.13Other methods of removal, including applicationof gasoline, nail polish, methylated spirits, petro-leum jelly, 70% isopropyl alcohol, or a hot kitchenmatch, appear to be less effective.14 Mechanicalremoval is accepted by most experts.15–17 Althoughsqueezing the abdomen of the tick on removalhas not been definitively linked to transmissionof disease, some evidence links squeezing theabdomen of the tick on removal to anaphylaxisresulting from tick bites.18 As with any injury, handwashing and wound cleansing should follow tickremoval.

The definitive treatment for snake bite is antivenom,which is not available for use in the first aid setting.It is not practical to treat shock, internal bleeding, orsevere neurotoxicity in the first aid setting. A per-son bitten by a snake that is venomous or might bevenomous should seek prompt medical attention.Transport by EMS allows delivery of supportive andstabilizing care before arrival at the hospital.2. A pit viper bite typically deposits venom intrader-mally or into the subcutaneous space. In a humanexperimental study, flow of an intradermally or sub-cutaneously injected radiotracer increased whenthe subject walked for ≥10 minutes.12 This couldlead to increased systemic absorption of venom.The ideal response in each situation requires\n\nHewett Brumberg et al"

Tourniquet application was found to be ineffec-tive or to worsen local tissue injury in systematicreviews of human and animal studies.13,15,198. The results of human and animal studies of pressureimmobilization bandaging are mixed with regard toboth intended effects (delayed onset of systemictoxicity) and to harms (worsening tissue injury).13,19Several studies show that medical personnel andlay rescuers had a low rate of appropriate pressureimmobilization bandage placement, even underideal conditions.21–23 Although a properly placedpressure immobilization bandage may have a rolein the management of neurotoxic snakebite, >95%of snake envenomation in North America involvessnakes with cytotoxic venom. Given this uncertainty,pressure immobilization bandaging is not currentlyrecommended for use in North America.24"

If a person with hypothermia cannot be immedi- ately moved from a cold environment to a warm one, they should be protected from further heat loss by insulation from the ground, covering of head and neck, and shielding from heat loss by wind using a plastic or foil layer in addition to a dry insulating layer.1C-LD3. When using rewarming devices of any kind, the first aid provider should follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the device used, place insulation between the heat source and skin, and frequently monitor for burns and pressure injury.1C-EO4. If a person with hypothermia has a decreased level of responsiveness such as unresponsive- ness, inability to remain awake, mumbling speech, confusion, or inability to participate in removal of clothing or has pallor, cyanosis, or frozen skin, the emergency response system should be activated while the person is rewarmed by any available method.1C-EO5.

The risk of burns from active external rewarm-ing was described in a 3-patient case series. Theauthors, who are subject matter experts, concludedthat first aid providers should ensure that manufac-turer instructions are followed, insulation (eg, cloth)is placed between the skin and the heat source(unless manufacturer instructions direct other-wise), and regular efforts are made to observeheated skin for signs of impending burn injury (eg,redness).94. Decreased level of responsiveness, mumblingspeech, confusion, the inability to participate inremoval of wet clothing, pallor, cyanosis, stum-bling, and frozen skin are potential signs of life-threatening hypothermia requiring immediaterewarming and advanced care.105. Shivering is a physiological response to cold expo-sure, capable of increasing heat production signifi-cantly, by ≈5 to 6 times the resting metabolic rate.Although it is an effective method for rewarming,shivering is also highly energy intensive, raisingthe core temperature of the body but at the costof substantial calorie expenditure. Providing high-calorie nutrition supports this metabolic demand,aids in maintaining energy reserves, and supportsthe natural rewarming process of the body. Theprovided substances should be at a safe tempera-ture to avoid any risk of burning the esophagus.116. In many freezing and windy settings, undressinga hypothermic person may further contribute totheir heat loss. In a simulation study evaluating amultilayer wrap such as those used in mountainrescue, a chemical heating blanket inside a foil orplastic vapor barrier wrap was effective at transfer-ring heat across dry and damp (but not saturated)fleece clothing. When evaluated in a simulatedscenario involving saturated clothing, the excessmoisture rendered the chemical heat packs inert.The researchers conclude that rescuers should cutoff saturated clothing in a protected environmentbefore wrapping wet, hypothermic people, butdamp clothing need not be removed.127. A simulation study of mildly hypothermic healthyvolunteers found that rewarming with an externalheat source was more effective than body-to-bodyheat donation by sharing an insulated bag with aneuthermic individual (2.46±1 °C/h compared with2.55±1.09 °C/h).13 Another similarly designedsimulation study found that core rewarming rateswere highest when using an 850-W heater andrigid cover (1.45 °C/h), charcoal heating and600-W rigid heater (0.7 °C/h), or 600-W heaterand blanket (0.57 °C/h) compared with body-to-body warming (0.52 °C/h).5"

Chemical heat packs used in studies rewarminghypothermic volunteers are large and are oftenbuilt into panels in blankets and cover the torso.For example, a recent simulation study used ablanket with 6 heating panels with a combinedmass of 397 g.12 In contrast, small chemical heatpacks marketed as glove and boot liners arebetween 15 and 60 g, and their ability to pro-vide heat is highly variable.14 The mass and heatgeneration of glove and boot liners are too low tofacilitate the active rewarming of a person withhypothermia.9. A simulation study describing the role of extremitycirculation in relation to core temperature foundthat heating the extremities and promoting thevenous return of cold blood from the extremitiesmay result in cooling of the central circulation.15Core temperature drop after external rewarminghas been confirmed in small human volunteerstudies.13,1610. Although people with simple cold stress (coldand shivering with normal mental status) weregenerally able to safely rewarm in a warmshower or warm water immersion in a single-patient experimental study of mild hypother-mia (core temperature ≈36° C), warm bathrewarming was associated with transient coretemperature drop, decreases in mean arte-rial pressure, and increases in heart rate andcardiac output.16 These effects can lead todecreased perfusion to the vital organs and,in severe cases, cause arrhythmia. In addition,attempting to manage a person with hypother-mia who is confused or has a decreased levelof alertness in a shower or bathtub is poten-tially dangerous for the person with hypother-mia and the first aid provider.\n\n1.

The forma-tion of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular andtissue damage. The extremities—fingers, toes, nose, andears—are particularly susceptible to frostbite. The sever-ity of frostbite varies from mild cases in which only theouter layers of the skin are affected (superficial frostbite)to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symp-toms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes inskin color (from pale to hardened and dark). In extremecases, frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digitor limb loss.\n\nA literature search was performed by the writinggroup in 2023."

Several animal model studies have demonstratedthat water temperature slightly above normalbody temperature (37–40° C [99–104° F]) isbest for rapid rewarming with a warm-waterimmersion technique.1,2 In one of these studies,rapid rewarming with warm water (45° C [113° F])was harmful.2 More recent human patient caseseries have demonstrated the safety and effi-cacy of rewarming frostbitten tissue in the rangeof 37° C to 40° C for between 20 and 30 min-utes.3,4 Five recent systematic reviews and clini-cal practice guidelines also endorse lukewarmwater immersion at or near this temperaturerange.5–9 If a thermometer is not available, watertemperature can be tested against one’s wrist,where it should feel slightly warmer than bodytemperature.2. The mechanism of tissue damage in frostbiteis the development of ice crystals in cells, whichcan destroy cell membrane integrity. As a result,it is widely recommended that tissue refreezingbe strictly avoided and first aid in-field rewarm-ing be considered only if the risk of refreezing isnegligible.6–8,103. Animal studies have demonstrated that use of awarm water immersion technique at a temperatureof 37° C to 40° C (98.6° F–104.0° F) is best forrapid rewarming of frozen tissue. Limbs left to thawspontaneously at 27° C to 29° C (81° F–84° F) alsohad good outcomes. Air rewarming can be usedas an alternative rewarming method when warmwater immersion is not possible.2\n\nHewett Brumberg et al"

Frostbite is a potentially tissue-threatening injury,and estimating the size and severity of frostbittentissue can be challenging, especially in the first aidsetting. Advanced treatment for frostbite such asthrombolytic medication can be administered onlyin a health care setting and is most effective whengiven soon after injury.11,12 Frostbite involving deepertissue depths may require care at a burn center.65. Tissue of the frozen extremities will swell, so it isrecommended to remove constricting items suchas jewelry and tight clothing.6. Frostbite is a common finding in hypothermicindividuals. However, rewarming the core of theperson with hypothermia is the treatment priority,and rewarming the extremities first can cause thecore temperature to decrease.13,147. A characteristic of acute frostbite and frozen tis-sue is the inability to sense touch, including ongo-ing mechanical tissue damage. A person withfrostbitten fingers and hands or toes and feetmay not be aware of ongoing damage causedby movement, especially walking. Experts recom-mend that frostbitten tissues be protected andthat frostbitten hands and feet not be used forclimbing or walking whenever it is avoidable.88. Frozen and thawed tissues are extremely vul-nerable to further injury and infection. Applyingbulky dressings provides a protective layer thatinsulates the tissue, maintaining an optimal heal-ing environment while shielding the area fromexternal contaminants and physical trauma. Afterthawing, tissues can become wet, increasing therisk of infection and delayed healing. Clean anddry dressings absorb excess moisture, keepingthe area dry and reducing the likelihood of bac-terial growth. Edema, or swelling, is a commonresponse in tissues damaged by freezing andthawing attributable to increased fluid accumula-tion and inflammatory processes. Loose, circum-ferential wrapping allows expansion as swellingincreases, which prevents the constriction ofblood flow and further tissue damage. Frozen andthawed tissues are susceptible to pressure soresand necrosis. Bulky dressings distribute pressuremore evenly, reducing the risk of localized pres-sure points that can compromise blood flow andtissue viability.89. NSAIDs decrease the production of prostaglandinsand thromboxanes that can cause vasoconstric-tion, dermal ischemia, and further tissue damagein frostbite. Ibuprofen is recommended by manyexperts and included in many treatment guidelines,although direct clinical evidence is lacking.5,8,1510. Intact skin is an essential barrier for infec-tion. Whenever possible, intact epidermal layersshould be left intact."

Althoughthere was variability between studies, thereview authors concluded that carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks (4%–9% glucose concentra-tion) were overall associated with the highestnet fluid balance. No beverage was superior forall end points studied, and all beverages exceptbeer were equal or superior to potable water forsome end points in some studies.\n\n1.

More than 80 000 people in theUnited States died of opioid overdose in 2021, with a14% increase in the age-adjusted death rate from opioidoverdose in a single year.1 In the same year, 1.06 millionpeople were treated in US EDs for nonfatal opioid over-dose.2 Most overdoses are unintentional.\n\nOpioid overdose causes central nervous systemdepression (sleepiness, unresponsiveness) and respira-tory depression (slowed and stopped breathing), which, ifuntreated, progresses to cardiac arrest.\n\nNaloxone is an antidote that reverses the effect ofopioid overdose, restoring consciousness and breathing.Naloxone can be administered by multiple routes, andnaloxone nasal spray is available in the United Stateswithout a prescription."

In addition to circumstantial evidence ofopioid exposure, miosis is strongly correlated withresponse to naloxone administration,63,64 althoughmany factors affect pupil size,65 and it is not estab-lished whether first aid providers can reliably iden-tify miosis. Naloxone has an excellent safety profileand is unlikely to be harmful if given to a personwith respiratory depression who does not have anopioid overdose.66,67 A person who is breathingnormally does not require naloxone.\n\nEarly activation of the emergency response systemis critical for people with suspected opioid over-dose. Rescuers cannot be certain that the per-son’s clinical condition is due to opioid-inducedrespiratory depression alone. This is particularlytrue in first aid settings, where determination ofthe presence of a pulse is unreliable,68,69 but eventrained first responders have difficulty rapidlydetermining pulselessness.70 Intranasal naloxonetakes several minutes to restore adequate respira-tions,39,55,56,58–60,62 and ventilatory support is crucialduring this time. Naloxone is not effective in othermedical conditions, including overdose involvingnonopioids and cardiac arrest resulting from anycause. People who respond to naloxone admin-istration are at risk of recurrent central nervoussystem or respiratory depression and require aperiod of observation before safe discharge from ahealth care setting.71–74 The risk of providing CPRto a person who is not in cardiac arrest is low.75Therefore, the safest course for a first aid provideris to immediately activate the emergency responsesystem, delivering high-quality CPR that includesboth compressions and ventilation, and administernaloxone. A health care professional who is able toreliably assess for the presence of a pulse can usethe appropriate health care professional algorithm."

    "full_text": "TRAUMAExternal Bleeding ControlBackground\n\nTrauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortalitythroughout the world, resulting in millions of deaths andhospitalizations each year. Uncontrolled bleeding is themost important preventable cause of death in 35% oftrauma patients and can occur before the arrival of emer-gency services.1–3 Life-threatening bleeding can be rec-ognized by pooling of blood on the ground, blood that is\n\nrapidly flowing or spurting from the wound, bleeding thatcontinues despite direct manual pressure, or bleedingthat results in systemic symptoms such as drowsiness,dizziness, chest pain, or loss of consciousness. Becausedeath can occur within minutes, first aid providers are es-sential in providing immediate care. Control of bleeding isa foundational first aid skill, and applying direct pressureis the mainstay of treatment. For extremity bleeding thatis not effectively controlled with direct pressure, tourni-quet application can be an appropriate intervention.\n\nDirect manual pressure is the hallmark of hemor-rhage control. If available, hemostatic dressings (whichcontain materials that help promote blood clotting), pres-sure dressings, mechanical pressure devices, and tour-niquets may augment the effectiveness of direct manualpressure or avoid the need for ongoing direct manualpressure. These devices may also be useful in a masscasualty event, when there are not adequate resourcesto provide direct pressure to all victims. Tourniquets arebeneficial for extremity hemorrhage only when they canbe applied proximal to the wound. Both commercial andimprovised tourniquets can be used. No human studieshave assessed the effectiveness of manual pressurepoints in individuals with life-threatening bleeding.\n\nThese guidelines are intended for use in the civilianfirst aid setting. The management of life-threateningbleeding in tactical rescue situations, mass casualtyevents, and military conflict is outside the scope of theseguidelines.\n\nThis topic was the subject of several 2020 ILCORsystematic reviews.4 An updated literature search wasperformed by the writing group in 2023.\n\nFirst Aid for Severe External BleedingCORLOERecommendations1C-LD1. Direct manual pressure should be applied to achieve initial control of external bleeding.2aC-LD2. A hemostatic dressing can be useful as adjunctive therapy to improve the effectiveness of direct manual pressure.2bC-LD3. Once bleeding has been controlled, it may be reasonable to apply a pressure dressing to maintain bleeding cessation.2bC-LD4. The utility of indirect manual pressure (ie, pres- sure points) for bleeding control is uncertain.2bC-EO5. Mechanical pressure such as pressure bandages or devices might be considered in some situa- tions when direct manual pressure is not feasible.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text"

Man-agement of an open chest wound in an out-of-hospitalsetting while awaiting the arrival of EMS is a challeng-ing scenario for a first aid provider. In patients with chesttrauma who are breathing spontaneously, air can en-ter the pleural space through the chest wall defect orthrough a lung wound during the inspiratory (negativeintrathoracic pressure) phase of the respiratory cycle (a“sucking chest wound”). The goal of a chest seal is to pre-vent air entry through the wound. Air can exit through thechest wall defect when intrathoracic pressure exceedsambient pressure such as during the expiratory phase ofspontaneous respirations, during positive-pressure ven-tilation (eg, rescue breathing, bag-mask ventilation), orif a tension pneumothorax is developing. The goal of achest seal is to prevent air entry into the pleural space.The greatest concern is the improper use of an occlu-sive dressing or device that could lead to fatal tensionpneumothorax by preventing air from exiting through thechest wound. It may be difficult for first aid providers tomonitor for signs of tension pneumothorax such as de-creased air movement on the affected side and low bloodpressure.\n\nA literature search was performed by the writinggroup in 2023.\n\nRecommendation for the Care of Open Chest Wounds\n\nCORLOERecommendations1C-EO1.

Loosening or removingthe dressing may relieve tension pneumothorax.The goal of sealing an open chest wound is toincrease the airflow resistance through the chestwall defect so that it is greater than resistancethrough the trachea, allowing proper lung ventila-tion. This is balanced against the risk of causingtension pneumothorax.For stab wounds, most handgun wounds, andmany rifle wounds, a small wound does notlead to enough air leak to impair respirations.For larger chest wall defects such as thosecaused by high-velocity rifle wounds, shotgunwounds, and blast injuries, first aid interventionsdesigned to reduce air entry through the woundare theoretically beneficial. Placement of a nonoc-clusive specialized dressing such as a vented chestseal may achieve this goal.There are no human studies of chest seals to informour treatment recommendations. The skill requiredto apply these devices correctly is unknown. Theeffect of these devices on patient-important out-comes (morbidity and mortality) is unknown. Theavailable evidence comes from porcine models andstudies on healthy human volunteers. Reportedoutcomes across the available evidence are dispa-rate, including device adhesion on soiled porcinechest walls,1 adhesion of new design for a ventedchest seal on healthy volunteers and vent func-tion,2 and valve malfunction and labored breathingin a porcine model of tension pneumothorax andhemothorax.3 One porcine study demonstrated thatboth vented and unvented chest seals providedimprovements in breathing and blood oxygenation;however, in the presence of ongoing intrapleural airaccumulation, the unvented chest seal eventuallyled to tension pneumothorax and hypoxemia.4The risk of occlusive dressing use in penetratingchest trauma has been detailed in the publishedliterature since the 1950s.5 Chest seal evalua-tions in animal models of hemopneumothoraxeshave demonstrated how these devices can fail.3Any dressing or device placed over an opening inthe chest wall has the potential to cause a tensionpneumothorax, particularly if the device does notallow egress of air. A first aid provider who places adressing or device should be aware of the potentialcomplications and monitor for its occurrence."

The mainstay of treatment for strains and sprainsis rest and limiting the use of the injured extremity.Often in the first aid setting, there is uncertaintyabout whether an injury is a sprain, strain, or a frac-ture; limiting use of the injured extremity avoidsworsening the injury.2. Cold application can acutely decrease pain andswelling in joint sprains and muscle strains. In anRCT of 74 patients with sports-related soft tissueinjury, cold therapy to soft tissue injuries improvedpain scores at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after injury.2 Coldtherapy improved edema compared with heattherapy in the acute time period.3 However, coldapplication has not been demonstrated to improvefunction or time to recovery.4 The greatest tissuecooling is achieved by using a bag filled with iceand water surrounded by a damp cloth.5,6 Othermodalities such as refreezable gel packs or icealone can also be used but do not cool the area aseffectively as an ice and water mixture.6,7 Expertsrecommend limiting the duration of cold applica-tion to 20 to 30 minutes for 3 to 4 times daily.8 Toprevent cold injury, ice should not be placed directlyon the skin.\n\nHewett Brumberg et al"

Burns can lead todamaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychoso-cial consequences.1 Immediate first aid care can reducethese consequences, and understanding the indicationsfor ED referral can be lifesaving.2\n\nSuperficial (first-degree) burns are characterized byskin redness and pain without blistering or other loos-ening or destruction of the skin surface (Figure 7). Theintact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree\n\nburns generally heal without scarring, and the risk ofinfection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) andfull-thickness (third-degree) burns involve destructionof the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and oftenrequire treatment beyond what can be provided in thefirst aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, andreduce scarring.2,4 Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or gen-italia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalationinjury (soot around the nose or mouth, difficulty breath-ing) require hospital treatment.\n\nActive cooling to “stop the burn” has long been advo-cated as essential immediate first aid for thermal burns.Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied,the majority of studies involve immediate application ofcool running water. There is a lack of international con-sensus about the optimal duration of cooling of thermalburns.\n\nThis topic was last reviewed by ILCOR in 20225 andwas included in a 2022 update.6 An updated literaturesearch was performed by the writing group in 2023.\n\nFirst Aid Cooling of Thermal BurnsCORLOERecommendations1B-NR1.

Cooling of burns with running water is an estab-lished and beneficial intervention with little riskof harm.5,6 A meta-analysis of observational data(7 studies, 11 383 adults and children) suggestsa decrease in the need for subsequent care inpatients with thermal burns who receive immediateactive cooling with clean running water.72. Because of their larger surface area–to–volumeratio, preadolescent children are more likelyto develop hypothermia than adolescents andadults. A study of 117 children with thermalburns who received whole-body cooling in theshower reported that 5 children (4%) developedhypothermia or were visibly cold with shivering.8By observing for signs and symptoms of hypo-thermia and, when possible, monitoring temper-ature, first aid providers can avoid accidentallycausing a child with burn injury to becomehypothermic.3. An ILCOR meta-analysis of 4 studies involving5978 adults and children did not demonstratea clear duration of cooling that was most effec-tive and concluded that the ideal cooling durationis unknown.5 Leading international organizationsrecommend active cooling durations of 5 to 20minutes.9–124. Porcine model thermal burn studies have demon-strated that ice reduces tissue temperatures afterthermal burn, but the application of ice has notresulted in faster wound re-epithelializing, or heal-ing with less scarring, compared with no treatment.Of note, there is risk of additional tissue damagewhen ice is used with compression.13 If cool or coldclean running water is unavailable and ice is used,the ice should be placed in a cloth or towel beforebeing applied to the burn area and limited to 10minutes of application time to prevent frostbiteinjury.\n\nFirst Aid for Thermal Burns After CoolingCORLOERecommendations1B-NR1.A person with a full-thickness burn or with a partial- thickness burn that is larger than the person’s palm or involves the person’s face, hands, feet, or genitals should promptly seek evaluation by a health care professional.1C-EO2.For a person with evidence of smoke inhalation injury such as facial burns, difficulty breathing, singed nasal hairs, or soot around the nose or mouth, EMS should be activated.1C-EO3.A person with thermal burns should promptly remove all jewelry, belts, and other tight items from burned areas.\n\nFirst Aid for Thermal Burns After Cooling (Continued )CORLOERecommendations2aB-NR4.

    "full_text": "Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1. Burns involving the face, hands, feet, and genitalsmay require surgical intervention to prevent perma-nent disability. Burns with a large surface area canlead to significant fluid loss and multisystem organfailure. The American Burn Association recom-mends that patients with second- or third-degreeburns involving the face, hands, feet, and geni-tals and those involving >10% body surface area(5% in children) be treated in a specialized burncenter because of the likely need for intravenousfluid resuscitation, surgery, and other specializedtreatments.14,152. Inhalation injury from hot smoke can lead rapidly toloss of the airway due to airway swelling. Evidenceof inhalation injury can also be indicative of carbonmonoxide poisoning. A person with signs of inha-lation injury such as facial burns, difficulty breath-ing, singed nasal hairs, or soot around the nose ormouth should have EMS activated immediately.15a3. Because burned tissue swells, expert consensusadvocates that jewelry be removed before theonset of swelling to prevent constriction and vas-cular ischemia.94. Over-the-counter analgesics such as acetamino-phen or NSAIDs are well tolerated and generallyrecommended for burn pain.16,17 A prospective studyenrolling 61 patients with second- or third-degreeburns randomly assigned to either receive 800 mgIV ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours found no sig-nificant incidence in serious adverse events.185. Petrolatum (with or without topical antibioticssuch as polymyxin), honey, and aloe have beenshown to improve healing time in patients withpartial-thickness, “open” burns, including unroofedblisters, compared with no dressing or variouscontrols.3,19–31 Most studies assessed the use ofvarious burn treatments daily or continuously untilcomplete healing; short-term use in the first aidsetting has not been well studied. Specialized burndressings are assumed not to be available in thefirst aid setting.\n\nHewett Brumberg et al\n\n6.

Does this vary between various manufactured and improvised devices?Is indirect manual pressure, including use of compression of pressure points or the use of mechanical pressure devices, effective for bleeding control in the first aid setting?Are open chest wounds best managed with occlusive dressings or with nonocclusive dressings or left open in the first aid setting?Will the deadoption of spine immobilization practices cause benefit or harm for injured individuals?Does splinting of long-bone fractures reduce pain or improve outcome?Is straightening of an angulated fracture by first aid providers associated with less pain, bleeding, or nerve or muscle injury compared with immobilization in the position found?What are the ideal cooling method and duration for thermal burns treated in the first aid setting?\n\nresearch methods are required to describe the effective-ness of first aid care from the perspective of health caresystem avoidance.\n\nSome conditions and therapies have a particularpaucity of evidence to guide treatments, despite beingfoundational content for first aid courses, such as theimmobilization of long-bone fractures, rewarming offrostbite, or cooling of thermal burns. RCTs of differentimmobilization strategies and cooling/warming meth-ods are needed. The role of technology such as mobilephones and wearables is also an important area forfuture research, including fall detection, measurementand monitoring of vital signs, and just-in-time training,instructions, and decision support tools."

Researchersshould record and report the sex and ethnicity of theirparticipants and strive for great diversity in recruitmentwhen feasible. Low-resource settings and low- andmiddle-income countries may experience the greatestimpact from robust first aid training, and work is urgentlyrequired to understand the unique first aid needs in thesecommunities and settings. In addition, more work needsto be done studying different approaches to first aid ininfants, toddlers, and children.\n\nSome critical knowledge gaps identified by the writinggroup are summarized in Table 13.\n\nWriting Group Disclosures\n\nThe American Heart Association makes every effort to avoid any actual or poten-tial conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an outside relationship or apersonal, professional, or business interest of a member of the writing panel.
