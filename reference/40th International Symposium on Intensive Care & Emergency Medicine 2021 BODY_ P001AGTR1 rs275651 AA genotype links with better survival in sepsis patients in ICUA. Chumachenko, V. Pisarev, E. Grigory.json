Chumachenko, V. Pisarev, E. GrigoryevFederal Research and Clinical Center of Intensive Care Medicine and Rehabilitology, V. A. Negovsky’ Research Institute of General Reanimatology, Moscow, Russian FederationCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P001Introduction: International studies demonstrate an annual increase in the frequency and impact of sepsis in intensive care units (ICU). Dysregulation of blood pressure makes a significant contribution during sepsis, especially septic shock. Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) affects the condition of the vessel wall and arteriolar tone. The AGTR1 gene encodes angiotensin II receptor type 1, which is involved in cardiovascular diseases. AGTR1 rs275651 AA genotype is associated with unstable angina. So, the aim of our study was to define the contribution of AGTR1 rs275651 genotypes to the course and outcomes of critical illness, complicated with sepsis.Methods: Study cohort included 145 ICU patients diagnosed with sepsis. 60% of patients underwent surgery, and 42% were diagnosed with diabetes as a major comorbidity. AGTR1 rs275651 polymorphism was studied by using specific polynucleotide tetraprimer set to amplify gene fragments from each patient’s DNA followed by analysis of PCR products in a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.Results: Septic shock occurred more frequently in patients with AT or TT genotype, than in homozygotic carriers of AGTRI A (p = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Also, patients with more common genotype AA and with sepsis often survived (p = 0.039, Fisher`s exact test, Fig. 1). SOFA values on days 1 were not different in patients of distinct AGTR1 genotypes. Expectedly SOFA values on day 2 and middle day in ICU were significantly lower in patients AGTR1 AA genotype compared to T carriers of (6.8 vs. 7.9, p = 0.04, t test and 6.9 vs. 8.4, p = 0.024, respectively).Conclusions: AGTR1 rs275651 AA genotype associates with survival advantage in sepsis patients in ICU setting presumably because of contribution to lower multiorgan failure and decreased occurrence of septic shock.Fig. 1(abstract P001)Survival of sepsis patients depends on AGTRI rs275651 genotypesP002Effects of xenon on proinflammatory activation and apoptosis of human neutrophils (ex vivo study)R.

After neutrophil isolation from the patient’s serum, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to the 4 million/ml cell concentrate at a dose of 200 ng/ml. The effect of xenon on the severity of inflammatory activation of neutrophils was assessed by the level of expression of CD11b and CD66b adhesion molecules on their surface and phosphorylation of pro-inflammatory kinases: ERK1/2 and kinase-p38.Results: The addition of lipopolysaccharide to the neutrophil incubation medium caused their activation, significantly increasing the phosphorylation of the key pro-inflammatory kinases of neutrophils: ERK1/2 and kinase-p38. After xenon anesthesia, there was a decrease in the expression of CD11b and CD66b adhesion molecules on the neutrophil surface and reducing the phosphorylation (activation) of pro-inflammatory kinases: ERK1/2 and MAP-kinase p38, which demonstrated its anti-inflammatory effect. The addition of LPS to the neutrophil incubation medium reduced their ability to spontaneous apoptosis 22 h after isolation, which was 22.6%, which was 60% less than in the control group-56.3% (p < 0.05). Xenon inhalation significantly increased to 41.35% (p < 0.05) the ability of neutrophils to spontaneous apoptosis after incubation with LPS.Conclusions: Inhalation of xenon 30 vol% for 60 min has a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect on neutrophils, reducing their activation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory kinases: ERK1/2 and MAP-kinase p38, reducing the expression of activation markers CD11b and CD66b on the surface of neutrophils and increasing their ability to spontaneous apoptosis.P003The systemic inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide administration is more pronounced in women than in menA.

We investigated whether sex affects the immune response and the development of endotoxin tolerance in a large cohort of volunteers undergoing repeated experimental human endotoxemia, an established in vivo model capturing many hallmarks of both early sepsis and sepsis-induced immunoparalysis.Methods: Subjects (54 females and 56 males) were intravenously challenged with 1 ng/kg bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) twice: on day 0 to determine the extent of the inflammatory response and again on day 7 to determine the degree of endotoxin tolerance. Area under the plasma cytokine time-concentration curves (AUCs) were calculated to provide an integral measure of the cytokine response.Results: Median [interquartile range] age was 23 [21–25] years for males and 23 [21–24] years for females (p = 0.18), whereas BMI was 23.0 [20.8–25.1] and 23.6"

Compared with males upon the first LPS challenge, females produced significantly higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF, 41% higher AUC), interleukin (IL)-6 (+ 50%), interferon gamma -nduced protein (IP)-10 (+ 47%), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (+ 112%), but not IL-10 (-4%, Fig. 1). Although a tolerant response was observed for all measured cytokines (all p < 0.0001 vs. first challenge), no differences in the degree of endotoxin tolerance between the sexes were observed.Conclusions: We demonstrate that females mount a more pronounced proinflammatory cytokine response following LPS administration than males, while levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the development of endotoxin tolerance were not different between the sexes. These findings indicate sex-specific regulation of the innate immune response. Sex hormone profiles are currently being determined to assess whether these differences have a hormonal origin.Fig. 1(abstract P003)Sex-specific differences in plasma levels of inflammatory mediators following repeated LPS administration on day 0 (D0, left panels) and day 7 (D7, center panels).

Habes, M. Kox, P.

Moreover, in critically ill patients, who almost invariably suffer from a pronounced immune response, a shift in gut microbiota composition is associated with infectious complications and mortality. We examined the relationship between interindividual differences in gut microbiota composition and variation in the in vivo cytokine response induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, we evaluated whether an LPS challenge alters the composition of the gut microbiota.Methods: Healthy male volunteers received an intravenous bolus of 2 ng kg−1LPS (n = 70) or placebo (n = 8).

Gut microbiota composition was determined using 16 s RNA gene sequencing of fecal samples obtained 1 day before (baseline) and 1 day and 7 days following the LPS challenge.Results: Baseline microbiota composition, analyzed by principal coordinate analysis and random forest analysis, did not differ between high and low responders for any of the four measured cytokines. Furthermore, baseline microbiota diversity (Shannon and Chao indices) was similar in high and low responders. No changes in microbiota composition or diversity were observed at 1 and 7 days following the LPS challenge (Fig. 1).Conclusions: Our results indicate that existing variation in gut microbiota composition does not explain the observed variability in the LPS-induced innate immune response. These findings strongly argue against the interplay between the gut microbiota composition and the innate immune response in humans.Fig. 1(abstract P004)Effect of LPS challenge on gut microbiota composition. a) Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of microbiota composition over time following LPS challenge (n = 63, paired samples across timepoints).

Data were compared with Student's t test and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: Twenty-four patients were enrolled in the study period, with an average age of 62 years. Table 1 shows the data collected. As can be seen, the improvement in the P/F ratio was immediate and has been maintained over time (pre-iNO: 95, G7: 167). A statistically significant reduction in CRP (pre-iNO: 129 mg/l, G7: 73 mg/l) and fibrinogen (pre-iNO: 6.08 g/l, G7: 4.76 g/l) was observed at three and seven days, at seven days of D-dimer (pre-iNO: 1.52 mg/l, G7: 1.1 mg/l). Ferritin showed a decreasing trend compared to baseline, reaching significance only on the third day. GB and PCT, on the other hand, did not show significant reductions.Conclusions: This study, while taking into account the limitation of the sample size and the absence of a control group, allowed to highlight a correlation between the use of nitric oxide and a reduction in systemic inflammation indices.

Regulating 2B4 and CD28 pathway was demonstrated to improve sepsis mortality in animal studies. We aim to determine the effect of them on mortality in patients with sepsis.Methods: This was a single-center, prospective observational study. Patients with sepsis who admitted to the ICU in Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University from April 2019 to December 2020 were included in this study. 2B4 and CD28 expression on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were tested on days 1, 3 and 7 after sepsis diagnosis.

GrigorievFederal Research and Clinical Center of Intensive Care Medicine and Rehabilitology, V.A.Negovsky Institute of General Reanimatology, Moscow, Russian FederationCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P010Introduction: Dysregulation of blood pressure significantly impacts the course of sepsis, especially septic shock. The AGTR1 gene encodes angiotensin II receptor type 1, which affects the vascular tone and contributes to septic shock [1]. Our study aims to define whether the AGTR1 polymorphism contributes to the course and outcomes of sepsis in patients admitted to the city hospital ICU facility.Methods: Study cohort included 157 ICU patients diagnosed with sepsis (SEPSIS-3, 2016); 66 patients were diagnosed with diabetes as major comorbidity. Functional AGTR1 rs275651 polymorphism [2, 3] was studied using a polynucleotide tetra primer set to amplify gene fragments followed by the analysis of PCR products by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.Results: The study revealed no differences in septic shock and lethality in patients with no diabetes differing in AGTR1 rs275651 genotypes. The septic shock occurred more frequently in patients with diabetes and minor T allele (AT and TT genotypes) than in homozygotic carriers of AGTRI AA and diabetes: p = 0.006 (Fisher test), odds ratio (OR) 11.692. There were no differences in shock during ICU hospitalization between AA genotype carriers vs. allele T carriers in a cohort of sepsis patients with no diabetes (n = 91, p = 0.8). Significant differences in lethality between diabetic sepsis patients and non-diabetic patients (Chi-square 7.698 (Yates); OR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.389 – 5.484, p = 0.006) were due to significantly increased lethality in diabetes patients with AT or TT AGTR1 genotype: OR = 11.034, p = 0.007 by Fisher test (Fig. 1). T allele carriers with sepsis and diabetes experienced increased SOFA and CIRS values.Conclusions: In sepsis, patients with diabetes minor mutation A > T within AGTR1 rs275651 associates with shock and increased lethality, vascular comorbidity, and organ failure.ReferencesCorrea TD et al.

The study aimed to investigate the capacity of current (procalcitonin [PCT]) and novel biomarkers (presepsin [P-SEP]) to predict both severity of illness and mortality in VA-ECMO patients.Methods: We performed a prospective single-center observational study of adult patients undergoing VA-ECMO following refractory cardiocirculatory shock, admitted to the Cardiothoracic ICU, University Hospital Of Verona, Italy. Subjects underwent daily plasmatic samples for dosage of PCT and P-SEP (sCD14-ST) during the total duration of 5 days from VA-ECMO cannulation. Blood cultures and tracheal aspirates were also collected daily. SOFA score was also assessed daily as the index of illness severity. The outcomes were considered in-hospital mortality and global illness severity. Sepsis was defined as the presence of both SOFA score > 7 and bacterial on any cultures.Results: A total of 19 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 58 ± 12 years. The average SOFA score was 11.2 (95% CI; 9.2–13.2). The majority (74%) met our sepsis criteria. In-hospital mortality was 32%. Median PCT levels were significantly higher in patients with sepsis (11.4 ± 10 ng/ml Vs. 2.6 ± 13 ng/ml, p = 0.001). The same relationship was observed for P-SEP (1410 pg/l Vs.685 pg/l, p = 0.01). Strong correlation was observed between the first 24 h SOFA score and P-SEP (r = 0.95; p > 0.001) than PCT (r = 0.48; p = 0.035). ROC curve analyses were performed. At chosen cut-off values, PCT and P-SEP accurately predict mortality in VA-ECMO patients (Fig. 1) but was inaccurate for sepsis (P-SEP, AUC 0.36).Conclusions: In our VA-ECMO patients, PCT and P-SEP were not able to predict sepsis. Instead, these biomarkers were strongly related to the severity of multi-organ dysfunction, and mortality. In particular, P-SEP was strongly associated with illness severity.Fig. 1(abstract P011)Receiver operating characteristic curves of P-SEP and PCT level in predicting patients’ mortality (PCT, AUC 0.815; P-SEPS, AUC 0.736)P012Serum SP-A, SP-D and CC16 in COVID-19 patientsM.

The data analysis was carried out taking into account the day of illness at the time of biomaterial collection, clinical and laboratory data.Results: The deceased patients presented with higher SP-A level (p = 0.009) (Fig. 1), age (p = 0.002), red blood cell distribution width (RDW) (p = 0.020), mean platelet volume (MPV) (p = 0.048), D-dimer (p = 0.049), blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.013), creatinine (p = 0.035) and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (p = 0.028), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, g/l) (p = 0.002) as compared to that of survivors on 1 – 10 days of illness. On 11 – 20 days of illness the, deceased patients also presented with higher age (p = 0.042), neutrophils (p = 0.010), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p = 0.004), RDW (p = 0.041), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.009) and lower CC16 level (p = 0.031), lymphocytes (p = 0.005) as compared to survivors. The serum SP-A and CC16 levels increased during the disease in patients with a favorable outcome (Kruskal–Wallis criterion, p = 0.035 and p = 0.018 respectively).Conclusions: Serum SP-A and CC16 are associated with COVID-19-related death.Fig. 1(abstract P012)Comparison of serum SP-A, SP-D and CC16 levels between survivor and non-survivor COVID-19 patients (Mann–Whitney U test)P013A 29-mRNA host response risk classifier enhances severity prediction in patients with suspected infection in the emergency department – a multicenter, observational studyF.

Validated clinical risk tools like qSOFA can be calculated at the bedside but suffer from limited accuracy in predicting outcomes, while time delay between infection, host response, and disease progression hampers the utility of routine biomarkers. We examined the performance of a 29-mRNA-based algorithm (IMX-SEV-3) as a predictor of clinical deterioration based on early host response patterns to acute infection.Methods: A total of 568 adult patients presenting to 6 US and 1 European emergency departments with suspected acute infection and/or sepsis of any etiology were enrolled (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03744741). Following consent, expression levels of 29 genes (+ 4 housekeeping genes) were measured on NanoString nCounter® and used as an input for a proprietary machine-learning classifier (IMX-SEV-3). Output severity scores were separated into three risk bands (low, moderate, and high) according to a priori locked cut-offs and compared to qSOFA for the composite endpoint “clinical deterioration” (need for vasopressors or mechanical ventilation within 7d, and/or 30d in-hospital mortality).Results: 65.3% of patients were judged by forced expert adjudication to have bacterial, viral, or co-infection. Overall, 46 patients (8.1%) reached the composite severity endpoint. qSOFA positive (≥ 2 points) patients had a risk of 21.4% to reach the composite endpoint, while qSOFA negative (≤ 1 points) patients had a risk of 6.6% (Fig. 1). Adding the IMX-SEV-3 classifier improved stratification in both qSOFA subgroups effectively: For high qSOFA, the endpoint was reached in 8%, 18%, and 50% (low, moderate, and high bands, respectively), while for low qSOFA, the endpoint was reached in 2%, 11%, and 18%.Conclusions: qSOFA risk estimation for increased severity and adverse outcome can be enhanced by combining with the novel IMX-SEV-3 score.Fig. 1(abstract P013)Distribution of patients over qSOFA and SEV-3 subgroups with corresponding proportion of patients reaching the composite endpoint “clinical"

In this preliminary analysis, forty-five (45) RT-PCR + patients were selected across the time frame of the study (March 18, 2020 – May 4, 2020). MDW results at baseline, based on a cut-off of 21.5 [1], were compared to RT-PCR results. The negative arm for this analysis constituted patients (N = 680) enrolled in a sepsis trial performed at the same site in Spain, prior to the pandemic [1]. Laboratory test results, microbial testing and radiological studies were extracted from the medical charts. Whole blood venous samples collected in K3EDTA were analyzed for MDW measurement on a UniCel DxH 900 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA).Results: The mean values of MDW were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (RT-PCR + = 28.64 ± 3.98 vs pre-pandemic arm = 22.00 ± 4.25; p < 0.05). ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889 (95% CI 0.855 – 0.923) for the initial assessment of MDW levels vs. RT-PCR. At a cut-off of 21.5 units, MDW effectively differentiated SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 92.1 – 100), specificity of 53.8% (95% CI 50.1 – 57.5), PPV of 12.53% (95% CI 9.5 – 16.36), and NPV of 100% (95% CI 98.9 – 100).Conclusions: An MDW cut-off of 21.5, previously validated for identification of sepsis in the ED, also reliably detects patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this initial study, MDW demonstrated a high clinical sensitivity and negative predictive value to identify those at a lower risk for COVID-19 disease.ReferenceHausfater P et al.

Multiple factors have an influence on the outcome in COVID-19, with one of such being the \"cytokine storm\" [2]. Several tools have been created to detect this condition, including Hscore and serum levels of biomarkers, but more data is needed to assess their role and significance in the critically ill patient.Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective descriptive transversal study at an ICU in a dedicated COVID-19 hospital. We recruited all severe COVID-19 confirmed adult patients with serum Interleucin-6 levels on admittance, with invasive mechanical ventilation requirements, starting March 2020 and until September 2020. After full laboratory and demographic data were collected, Hscore was calculated and put through statistical analysis with comparison between survivors at end of the follow up versus not survivors.Results: A total of 820 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were identified, of which 130 required invasive mechanical ventilation during their stay. Of that group 123 patients had interleukin-6 levels screened on admittance. Both survivor and not survivor groups had similar demographic and laboratory parameters, with a non-significant difference in Hscore, ferritin and IL-6 between the groups. A positive significant association was found with Interleukin-6 levels and length of stay in the hospital (p = 0.001).Conclusions: Cytokine storm as such diagnosed by Hscore seems to have no significant association with survival on a invasive mechanical ventilation population with COVID-19. Interleukin-6 is strongly associated with a lengthened hospital stay.Referenceshttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality. Accessed 21–6-21Fajgenbaum DC et al.

Whether this classification may translate into a prognostic tool and treatment guidance is unclear. We aimed to extend and assess the usefulness of a simplified algorithm in phenotyping sepsis and severe COVID-19.Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 1498 patients (620 with bacterial sepsis, 878 with severe COVID-19). Patients with bacterial sepsis were classified into phenotypes using a digital algorithm, based on six baseline parameters (creatinine, lactate, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, international normalized ratio), as previously described [2]. All patients with severe COVID-19, included in an open-label immunotherapy trial (NCT04357366; NCT 04,339,712), were assessed during April to June 2020 and July to December 2020. All patients during the second period received dexamethasone. Stepwise Cox regression analysis with Acute Pathophysiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II as predefined variable was used to assess phenotype impact on 28-day mortality.Results: Phenotypes α and γ were most prevalent in bacterial sepsis (41.8% and 22.4% respectively); δ phenotype was associated with the highest mortality (Fig. 1A). Phenotype α was seen in younger patients, mainly presenting pneumonia and respiratory failure. Phenotype assignment was an independent determinant of outcome (adjusted p: 0.007). Phenotype distribution and outcomes in severe COVID-19 were similar to those of bacterial sepsis (Fig. 1B; adjusted p: 0.0023). Phenotypes α and γ displayed favorable response to anakinra (p < 0.001), while phenotypes β and δ showed trend to improvement with tocilizumab (p = 0.047).Conclusions: A simple operational algorithm classified patients with sepsis in phenotypes and predicted outcome, independently of initial severity. This classification may guide treatment response in severe COVID-9.ReferencesSeymour CW et al. JAMA 321:2003–17, 2019Karakike E et al.

Retrospective analysis of data using ICCA (IntelliSpace Critical Care and Anaesthesia) to compare the number of antibiotic doses administered per patient before and after introduction of PCT. After PCT introduction, we recorded the number of PCT levels requested, their frequency as well as the level of PCT and when discontinuation occurred.Results: Eighty-one patients were included—13 admitted before PCT introduction and 68 after (this important increase in the number of patients is explained by the increased proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis). The average dose of antibiotics administered per patient was reduced by 28.8% (70.24 vs 49.98) following introduction of PCT. Despite an incurred cost of £12 per PCT assay, the overall average cost per patient was reduced by £59.60 (£257.94 vs £146.78). A lack of consistency in the frequency of PCT level request was observed.Conclusions: Introduction of PCT to aid discontinuation of antibiotics resulted in a 28.8% reduction in average antibiotics prescription and an overall cost reduction of £59.60 per patient. The reduction in antibacterial exposure also brings non-financial benefits such as increased patient safety through experience of less side effects, reduction in antibiotics resistance among others.

Endotypes from clustering were characterized by length of stays (LOS) and hospital discharge outcomes.Results: Clustering analysis identified five distinct groups (Fig. 1). Cluster 1 contained a large proportion of suspected sepsis patients and 3 contained most septic patients. Clusters 2 and 4 contained the majority of septic shock patients, with 2 having the larger proportion and the overall longest hospital LOS (10.7 days) and largest mortality (35%). Cluster 5 contained nearly all non-septic patients. Clusters with mixes of statuses highlight potential similarities among patients with different sepsis-3 classifications, and the limitations of consensus criteria.Conclusions: Using temporal data with a broader range of features, we identified five distinct endotypes for sepsis and septic shock.

Hospitalization lasted for 50 ± 20.8 days. Sera samples prepared from blood withdrawn on the first 24 h on admittance were stored at -18 oC. After storage, 1 μl of sera was applied on > 125 000 randomly synthesized 12-mer peptide microarrays (Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ, USA) and reactions were detected with Alexa Floor 647 labeled anti-IgG and laser scanner. Data analyzed using the BRB-ArrayTools software.Results: On admittance, patients exhibited 15 ± 8.2 scores on NIHSS and 13 ± 2.0 scores on Glasgow Coma Scale. Ten patients deceased during the study. Twenty patients developed severe pneumonia: Group 1 complicated with sepsis (SEPSIS-3, n = 6, 1 patient survived) and Group 2 (pneumonia, no sepsis; n = 14), with decreased lethality (p = 0.002, Fisher exact test).

EAA was measured at the ICU admission (baseline), day 3 and day 7. EAA levels were distinguished in high (EAA > 0.6) and low (EAA < 0.6) endotoxin activity. Blood gas analysis, hemodynamic and breathing pattern parameters were also recorded. We also considered the infections developed during ICU stay and the inflammatory parameters.Results: The figure shows the percentage of patients with high and low EAA, respectively. Of the 40 patients enrolled, 14 had an elevated EAA at the first EAA determination. In this group, the mortality was 57%. In the group of patients without preexisting elevated EAA the mortality was 42%. At baseline, we could not find any correlation between EAA and clinical, ventilatory and hemodynamic characteristics. At day 3 and 7, lactates, presepsin and SOFA score kidney component values were significantly higher in the group of patients with EAA > 0.06.Conclusions: We found that elevated EAA was 35%. This raises the question if a “hypoperfusion”, hyperinflammatory state or a direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on small intestinal enterocytes may induce LPS translocation. Further studies are needed to evaluate if high EAA at ICU admission may allow an early recognition of patients with worse ICU outcome.Fig. 1(abstract P022)Percentage of patients with EAA high and low, respectively during the 7 days of the studyP023Outbreak ofStenotrophomonas maltophiliapneumonia in ICU COVID-19 patientsM.

It contributes to the high morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population. Pathogens are variable and includePseudomonas,Klebsiella,AcinetobacterandStaphylococcusspecies. Recently, a new surge of many environmental bacteria was described particularlyStenotrophomonas maltophilia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of this new outbreak ofStenotrophomonas maltophiliapneumonia in COVID-19 ICU patients.Methods: This study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital with a setting of 23 ICU beds. All COVID-19 ICU patients admitted between March 2020 and April 2021 were analyzed. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the prevalence of bacterial secondary pneumonia and those caused byStenotrophomonas maltophilia.Results: A total of 155 ICU COVID-19 admitted patients with 76% men were analyzed.

Prior work proposed clinical sepsis phenotypes at presentation and explored change in phenotype over time. However, little is known about how change in phenotype is associated with outcome. We explored trajectories of phenotypes in the ProCESS trial and the association between change in phenotype and outcome.Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 815 adult sepsis encounters from the ProCESS trial in the Usual Care and EGDT arms that survived in-hospital for at least 72 h post-randomization. We predicted clinical phenotypes at randomization and 72-h post-randomization using Euclidean distance anchored to previously published cluster centroids (α,β,y,∂). We defined core members as ≥ 90% and marginal as < 90% probability of phenotype membership at randomization. We used logistic regression to determine the odds of phenotype transition by phenotype, treatment arm, and membership probability. We explored the relationship between treatment arm, phenotype transition, and in-hospital mortality within the ∂-phenotype.Results: We studied 815 adult sepsis encounters from the ProCESS trial (median age 60, [IQR 50–72]; 56% male, median SOFA at arrival 7, [IQR 4–9]) surviving for at least 72 h post-randomization. At presentation, encounters were 36% α-type, 37% β-type, 13% y-type, and 25% ∂-type. Phenotype was unchanged over 72 h in 46% of encounters. Marginal membership was (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4–2.6, p < 0.01), but treatment arm was not (OR 0.9 95% CI 0.7–1.2, p = 0.33, Fig. 1A) associated with increased odds of phenotype transition.

Evidence suggests a precision treatment approach of IV fluids and vasopressors may improve early sepsis care.Methods: We developed a precision treatment policy for i.v. fluids and vasopressors in early sepsis using Q-learning in clinical Electronic Health Record data. We identified patients with Sepsis-3 features within the first 6 h of presentation at 14 academic and community UPMC hospitals in Pennsylvania, USA, from 2013–2017. We organized 38 model features into 4-h timesteps from hospital arrival until 48-h after sepsis onset. We defined the state space using K-means clustering. The action space was a 5 × 5 matrix of i.v. fluid and vasopressor doses, including no drug administered then doses divided into quartiles. Awards and penalties were applied, maximizing 90-day patient survival. We compared AI and Clinician policy performance using weighted importance sampling with bootstrapped confidence intervals and determined absolute risk difference in predicted 90-day mortality across patient- and hospital-level subgroups.Results: We studied 30,687 early sepsis patients (mean age 64 (SD, 16) years; mean SOFA 3.5 (SD, 2.9)). The value of the AI treatment policy was significantly higher than the Clinician policy value (41.9, 95% CI: 41.2–42.7 vs 40.8, 95% CI 39.9–41.6). Predicted risk of 90-day mortality was lower among subgroups with advanced age, higher SOFA scores and non-surgical sepsis treated per the AI policy (Fig. 1A). The AI policy value exceeded the Clinician policy across all study hospitals and predicted mortality risk difference ranged from 0.01–1.18% (Fig. 1B).Conclusions: Precision treatment using i.v. fluids and vasopressors is associated with lower 90-day mortality risk among early sepsis patients compared to patients treated per clinician policy, particularly among patients with advanced age, surgical sepsis and severe organ dysfunction.Fig. 1(abstract P025)(A) Forest plot"

Butler, A. GeorgiouIntensive Care Unit, Royal United Hospitals Bath, Bath, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P026Introduction: A key tenet of ICU care following emergency laparotomy is administration of appropriate empirical antimicrobials, with prescribing adjustment based on microbiological results. We conducted a quality improvement project with the intention of increasing the frequency of intraoperative peritoneal fluid sampling during emergency laparotomy to see how this would affect postoperative antimicrobial prescribing on the ICU.Methods: A baseline audit showed the frequency of fluid sampling to be 31%. Through collaboration with our surgeons, we encouraged peritoneal fluid sampling for microbiological analysis at the time of emergency laparotomy. Any prescribing changes required from our empirical antibiotics (amoxicillin, metronidazole and gentamicin) were noted.Results: Over an 18-month period, 120 emergency laparotomies were performed on 110 patients. A sample was sent from the peritoneal cavity during 76 operations (63%). Fifty-three samples yielded positive growth. Of these 36 (68%) samples showed antibiotic resistance patterns: 22 (42%) to amoxicillin/co-amoxiclav, 3 (6%) to gentamicin, and 4 cultures (7%) to both. Six (11%) grew candida, one of which was resistant to voriconazole. Of the samples yielding positive growth, a total of 31 (58%) therefore yielded results which would influence a change in prescribing from the hospital’s empirical antibiotics. For patients in whom a sample was sent for analysis, a prescription change would therefore be expected in 40%.Conclusions: Our results suggest that sampling peritoneal fluid during emergency laparotomy may alter 40% of antibiotic prescriptions on ICU. Further work is required to understand how this affects patient outcome, but in the absence of these data it seems reasonable to advocate peritoneal fluid sampling during emergency laparotomy to guide subsequent antibiotic decision making on the ICU.P027Eclipse-it: elderly critically ill patient representation in interventional trials, a systematic reviewR.

Unfortunately, critical care evidence-based guidelines for this population are lacking and its representation in randomized control trials (RCTs) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate older adults’ participation in critical care RCTs and whether age is considered during analysis.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews in Pubmed, Ovid, Central and Cochcrane, from January 1, 2009, to October 16, 2019. We included critical care systematic reviews and meta-analysis of RCTs based on five ICU topics deemed important for older ICU patients: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, nutrition, mobilization and sedation. We collected studies’ baseline characteristics, intervention type, and extracted any age information in methods and results. We calculated the proportion of RCTs excluding older adults, with an age central tendency above 65 years, and with outcomes stratified by age and with age-specific subgroup analysis. We used Chi-squared and Kruskal–Wallis tests for comparison between groups.Results: We included 152 RCTs in our systematic review. Older age was an exclusion criterion in 17 (11%) RCTs. Between them, average age was over 65 years for 4 (24%) RCTs and over 70 years for 1 (1%). Those proportions were similar to the 132 trials without age exclusion (p = 0.581). Through the 152 RCTs, outcomes were stratified by age for 5%. Age-specific exploratory subgroup analysis was performed in 5 (3%) trials and 1 RCT reported an interaction between age and intervention, and reported different outcomes in older adults and not for younger ones.Conclusions: Older adults’ participation remains underrepresented in intensive care RCTs. The treatment effect differences are not documented. This heightens the need for more age consideration in studies and more studies dedicated for older adults in order to help clinician treat this growing population.P028Trends in the epidemiology and treatment of sepsis—a nationwide observational studyE.

Population incidence, patient characteristics, treatment received and outcome were compared across the study years.Results: During the six study years, 9166 patients were admitted to Icelandic ICUs, 971 (10.6%) because of severe sepsis or septic shock. The crude incidence of sepsis requiring admission to ICU remained stable between 0.55–0.75 per 1000 inhabitants. No significant trends were observed over time in patient age (mean 64.7 years), APACHE II score (mean 21.4), SOFA score (mean 8.1) or Charlson Comorbidity Index (mean 4.2). Mortality rates declined slightly from the first study year (2006) to the last (2016), both 28 day (27.7% to 22.2%, p = 0.25) and one year 45.8% to 38.2%, p = 0.17). Patients admitted to the ICU from the emergency department (ED) were 477 (49.1%). Length of stay in the ED before ICU admission increased from 2:52 (hr:min) in 2006 to 4:53 (p = 0.003) in 2016 and the time to drawing of blood cultures increased from 0:41 in 2008 to 1:21 in 2016 (p = 0.013). The time to a lactate measurement decreased from 4:03 in 2006 to 1:09 in 2016, p < 0.001). Achievement of the goals of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines was not associated with better 28-day survival (p = 0.60).Conclusions: Using observed clinical criteria in a nationwide population, the incidence and outcome of sepsis did not change over an 11-year period.

GrintescuAnaesthesia and Intensive Care, Clinical Emergency Hospital of Bucharest, Bucharest, RomaniaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P031Introduction: The outcome of patients with viral respiratory infections may be affected by the simultaneous bacterial infection occurrences. Considering the widespread overuse of antibiotics during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the rate of co-infections and/or superinfections in patients infected with the novel severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains to be elucidated.Methods: In order to evaluate the emerging rate of bacterial co-infections and/or superinfections, defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, we performed a retrospective, observational study that included 157 critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Survival rate and the main risk factors were also analyzed in the study group.Results: In the study group, only 33.12% met the criteria for coinfection and15.92% (n = 25) for superinfection. Survival rate evaluated based on the analysis of Kaplan–Meier curves highlighted that patients with co-infections have a median survival of 8 days vs.18 days for those with superinfections, p = 0.0074. Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus registered an increase of superinfections rate (chi-squared = 6.295, p = 0.01, OR = 2.97). Moreover, patients previously treated with remdesivir recorded a higher risk of superinfections (coefficient = 1.26, p = 0.02, OR = 3.55).Conclusions: The rate of co-infections and/or superinfections in COVID-19 patients is rather low, therefore the rationale of the antimicrobial therapy use should be reconsidered. As already stated, co-infections are associated with a poorer survival rate in patients with severe viral respiratory infections, even with the novel coronavirus. The main risk factors for hospital-acquired superinfections in COVID-19 patients were diabetes mellitus and the use of antiviral therapy.P032Extracorporeal hemoperfusion with an LPS-selective mesoporous polymeric adsorbent decreases neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in septic shock patientsV.

Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to explore the correlation between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) estimated fluid volumes and the Vd of several hydrophilic antibiotics in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the relationship between BIA measurements and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and cumulative fluid balance was evaluated.Methods: A prospective observational study was carried out in patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam or vancomycin, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of UZ Leuven. BIA measurement was performed during the same dosing interval as the collection of blood samples to calculate the Vd of the administered antibiotic. Vd was calculated using non-compartmental analysis.Results: In total, 68 patients were included. As shown in Table 1, significant correlations between Vd and BIA measurements of body water were found for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (r > 0.78; strong), meropenem (r > 0.43; moderate) and piperacillin/tazobactam (r > 0.51; moderate). When all antibiotics were pooled, correlation remained significant, albeit weak (r > 0.32). No significant correlation was found with the Vd of vancomycin. Patients with an abnormal BIA estimated hydration status appeared more severely ill (i.e., higher SOFA scores). No association with cumulative fluid balance was found.Conclusions: This study demonstrated the existence of a significant positive correlation between BIA assessed fluid status and the Vd of antibiotics at the ICU. However, correlations were not as strong as expected and absolute BIA measurements were not found to be useful in clinical practice.Table 1(abstract P033)Results of correlation between BIA estimated fluid volumes and the volume of distribution of several antibiotics (separate and all antibiotics pooled)AntibioticTBW (L)ECW (L)ICW (L)ECW (%)Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (n = 10)45.85 ± 11.02;r = 0.90* [0.66;1.00]22.84 ± 6.31;r = 0.78* [-0.003;1.00]23.01 ± 5.31;r = 0.88* [0.55;1.00]49.55 ± 4.07;r = -0.042 [-0.80;0.81]Meropenem (n = 21)44.05 ± 9.78;r = 0.47* [0.03;0.76]22.49 ± 6.35;r = 0.43* [0.03;0.71]21.56 ± 3.65;r = 0.50* [0.21;0.71]50.43 ± 3.47;r = 0.25 [-0.21;0.59]Piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 16)39.90 ± 8.78;r = 0.34 [-0.22;0.73]19.33 ± 4.56;r = 0.51* [0.13;0.76]20.56 ± 4.48;r = 0.16 [-0.4;0.62]48.31 ± 2.66;r = 0.57* [0.04;0.86]Vancomycin (n = 21)40.87 ± 11.89;r = 0.28 [-0.22;0.70]20.06 ± 6.45;r = 0.20 [-0.30;0.61]20.81 ± 5.78;r = 0.29 [-0.20;0.67]48.90 ± 3.46;r = -0.21 [-0.66;0.28]Total – all antibiotics pooled (n = 68)42.36 ± 10.45;r = 0.33* [0.10;0.55]21.05 ± 6.05;r = 0.32* [0.09;0.53]21.31 ± 4.78;r = 0.33* [0.10;0.52]49.33 ± 3.42;r = 0.12 [-0.16;0.39]Values are represented as mean ± SD.

Sellami, I. Ben Mrad, M. Zakraoui, S. Bougheriou, M. FerjaniDepartment of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunis, TunisiaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P034Introduction: Vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium(VREF) is one of important etiologies of nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. VREF bacteremia was associated with a poorer outcome, given that overall mortality rates may reach values higher than 60% with an attributable mortality of around 40%. Few data are available concerning factors associated with mortality in the context of VREF bacteremia in different centers. The aim of our study was to determine incidence and risk factors associated with VREF bacteremia in an intensive care unit.Methods: A retrospective case–control study was performed in the ICU from January 2014 to December 2020. Cases were defined as septic patients with VREF isolated from a blood culture. VREF was defined as anE. faeciumisolate with an MIC of vancomycin ≥ 32 μg/ml by the E-test according to the standards of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Control patients were randomly drawn from 50 hospitalized patients with vancomycin-susceptibleE. faecium(VSEF) isolated from a blood culture.Results: Seventeen case patients and 50 control patients with at least one positiveE. faeciumblood culture were identified. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the case and control groups were similar, except for mean duration of length of stay (68 ± 9 vs 22 ± 8, p < 0.0001). Mortality did not differ significantly between those with VREF (25%) and those with VSEF (14%) isolates (p = ns). In the univariate analysis, the significant risk factors for VREF bloodstream infections included diabetes mellitus (p = 0.04), end-stage renal disease (p = 0.03), prior exposure to corticosteroids (p = 0.02), prior receipt of vancomycin (p = 0.04) and a prolonged length of stay in ICU (p < 0.01) (Table 1).Conclusions: VREF bacteremia in critically ill patients was associated with a poorer outcome. Several risk factors have been identified and they should be considered in infection control practice to prevent VREF infection or colonization and to reduce they duration.Table 1(abstract P034)Risk factors for vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faeciumbacteremiaVREF Case group (n = 17)VSEF Control group (n = 50)p valueLength of stay in ICU (mean ± SD, days)68 ± 922 ± 8< 0.01Prior receipt of vancomycin1450.04Diabetes mellitus1010.04End-stage renal disease700.03Prior exposure to corticosteroids1060.02P035Impact of intensive care unit acquired infections caused by multidrug resistant organisms on costs: preliminary findings of a Brazilian multicenter cohort studyA.P.

We measured all fixed (personnel, overheads, depreciation) and variable costs (lab/image tests, transfusions, renal replacement therapy, medical materials and drugs) during ICU stay ICU-acquired infections were those diagnosed 48 h or later after ICU admission. We considered carbapenem-resistantAcinetobacter,PseudomonasandEnterobacteriaceae; vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus; methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus; and imidazole-resistantCandidaas MDR microorganisms. We considered non-multidrug resistant (NMR) all other infections. We built a linear mixed model, with ICU as a random-effect, and age, sex, type of admission (medical, elective surgical and emergent surgical), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), frailty measured by the Modified Frailty Index (MFI) and SAPS 3 as confounders to assess the association between ICU-acquired infection by MDR microorganisms and daily patient cost.Results: A total of 3077 patients were included, from whom, 70 (2.3%) acquired ICU MDR infections and 237 (7.3%) acquired NMR infections. Demographic, clinical and patients’ outcomes are presented in Table. ICU mortality and length-of-stay were increased in patients with NMR and MDR ICU-acquired infections. Fixed and variable costs were increased in patients with NMR and MDR ICU-acquired infections. MDR infections (β = USD 52.34; CI 95%, 12.60–92.07) but not NMR infections (β = USD 16.13; CI 95%, 6.55–38.80) were associated with increased daily patient ICU costs.Conclusions: MDR ICU-acquired infections are associated with increased daily and total ICU costs.

Four clinical phenotypes of sepsis are proposed, yet the association between sepsis phenotypes and treatment response is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the relationship between antibiotic treatment delay and mortality when modified by clinical sepsis phenotype.Methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of adult patients with sepsis and septic shock as reported to the New York State Department of Health (2015 to 2017), and identified clinical sepsis phenotypes (α,β,γ,∂) using a modified approach from the Sepsis ENdotyping in Emergency Care (SENECA) algorithm [1]. We used multivariable logistic regression to understand association between time to antibiotic administration and in-hospital mortality by sepsis phenotype.Results: We studied 55,169 encounters (median age 72 years, [IQR 60–83 years]; 52% male, 22% in-hospital morality) and found 34% α-type, 30% β-type, 19% γ-type, and 17% ∂-type. The α-type was younger with the lowest in-hospital mortality, the β-type was older with more renal dysfunction, and ∂-type had elevated lactate levels with the highest proportion of septic shock. Antibiotic treatment delay was associated with increased risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality across all phenotypes, but effect size varied by phenotype (α: OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.00–1.05, p = 0.08; β: OR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02–1.06, p < 0.01; γ: OR 1.02, 95%CI 0.99–1.05, p = 0.18; ∂: OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.05–1.10, p < 0.01; Interaction p-value 0.045).Conclusions: More rapid completion of administration of antibiotics, particularly among the delta clinical phenotype, was associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality.ReferenceSeymour CW et al.

Our further discoveries include (a) circulating extracellular microvesicle-associated iNOS (MV-A iNOS) and (b) MV-A iNOS's putative role of causing the cellular damage, vascular leak, and organ dysfunction that are the hallmarks of sepsis by its production of toxic quantities of nitric oxide (NO). We developed a humanized anti-MV-A iNOS monoclonal antibody candidate immunotherapeutic, AseptiMab®, to specifically target circulating MV-A iNOS and to neutralize its harmful effects.Methods: The ability of AseptiMab to inhibit the sepsis cascade and rescue challenged animals from sepsis was tested in three different animal models of sepsis. One model used an LD80 dose of endotoxin (LPS); another model used an LD80 dose of TNF-α, and the third model used an LD80 dose of MV-A iNOS. At 0, 2, or 6 h after the animals were challenged, they were administered either saline (as placebo controls), a low dose of AseptiMab, or a high dose of AseptiMab.Results: In all three animal models of sepsis tested, AseptiMab was effective at rescuing challenged animals from sepsis compared to the saline control groups. The Kaplan–Meier curves conclusively demonstrate that treating the challenged animals with AseptiMab was effective. Up to 80% of the challenged animals can be rescued from sepsis by AseptiMab. Its effectiveness was both time and dose dependent: earlier and higher doses result in improved survival. If a high dose was administered early after the challenge, all the animals could be rescued.Conclusions: In three different animal models of sepsis, AseptiMab effectively treated the sepsis pathology as compared to placebo.ReferenceWebber RJ et al.

The available evidence is uncertain and knowledge on the subject is evolving [1]. The purpose of our observational retrospective study is to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality in COVID-19 positive ICU patients after balancing for possible confounding factors.Methods: A total of 164 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to ICU were included, divided into two groups: 110 patients (Group A) received corticosteroid therapy while 54 (Group B) did not. The daily dose was 8 mg of dexamethasone for a duration of 7 days subsequently reduced until discontinuation.Results: In group A, 28 patients (25%) died while in group B 15 patients (27%).

So, several guidelines advocate the use of empirical antibiotics for patients with severe COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) combined with antibiotics to decrease the incidence (I) of superinfections in severe COVID-19 patients mechanically ventilated for ARDS.Methods: We performed a RCT from January 2021 to May 2021. We enrolled 40 patients, 65 ± 12 years old, admitted in a teaching hospital ICU. We randomized 2 groups of 20 patients: A first group receiving broad spectrum antibiotics (ANT) and IVIG and a second group (grp) receiving the same antibiotics and placebo (C). IVIG were administered after the first dose of ANT, at a dose of 0.5 g/kg at flow of 3 ml/kg/h during the first 3 days. We recorded in the two groups: SOFA score Day 1 and Day 7, PaO2/FiO2day 1 and day 7, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, hospital length of stay (LOS), the I of secondary bacterial infections at Day 14 and 28-day mortality.Results: In IVIG grp, the mean I of superinfections was less than in the C grp respectively 13.5% vs 26% (Table 1). The I of blood stream infections was reduced in IVIG grp comparatively to C grp respectively 8% vs 14.9%. The I of ventilation-associated pneumonia was reduced in IVIG grp comparatively to C grp respectively 20% vs 40%. The I of Gram + infections was reduced in IVIG grp comparatively to C grp respectively19% vs 37%.

Our study determined safety, feasibility and effectiveness of clinical use of a hemoperfusion (HP) with a novel SDC adsorber to remove pro-inflammatory molecules from the bloodstream of COVID-19 patients.Methods: A total of 42 COVID-19, PCR + patients, age < 81 years, average 63 (SD range, 54–69) years, 52% men, lethality 48%, underwent standard treatment for COVID-19. On day 0, patients exhibited (median and IQR): PaO2/FiO2160 (130–200); APACHE II 18 (18–20); SOFA 6.5 (6–8); IL-6 841 (709–1424) pg/ml, CRP 109 (84–140) mg/l; ferritin 628 (547–678) µg/l. Group 1 (n = 29) continued to receive standard treatment whereas group 2 (n = 13) received HP procedure once, for 3–4 h, using Efferon CT adsorbers containing mesoporous SDC beads uptaking 6–60 kD molecules [2, 3] followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. Groups matched on age and sex; group 2 included more severe patients requiring HP support. Data were treated using R-statistics by XLStat.Results: Despite significant intergroup differences in disease severity as shown by SOFA, ALT, AST, SpO2, pH, lactate, LDH, and IL-6 alterations on day 0, the HP treatment resulted in no difference in lethality between groups. Patients on HP experienced pH increase and rapid decline of SOFA and lactate as covariates most contributed to lethal outcome; IL-6 and ferritin levels significantly decreased vs. group 1 (Fig. 1). Decreased lethality by HP was significant in a subset of patients on mechanical ventilation exhibiting SOFA < 9 (p = 0.024 vs. group 1).Conclusions: Anti-cytokine HP with Efferon CT adsorbers is feasible and safe method providing a lifesaving promise for a subset of patients with COVID-19 that warrants extended clinical trials.ReferencesRonco C. et al.

Saunders1, E. Pervolaraki21Coreva Scientific, Königswinter, Germany;2Cardinal Health, High Wycombe, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P042Introduction: Saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are common during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Surgical site infections (SSI) are rare but potentially dangerous and costly adverse events. SSI rates during these procedures were assessed for multiple UK healthcare centers and a published health-economic model was used to estimate the associated burden of these events. Single-patient use electrocardiogram (spECG) monitoring may contribute to the prevention of cross contamination and help reduce the risk of an SSI. The cost-saving potential of spECG was also assessed.Methods: NHS digital data for SVGs (K401-K404) taking place between March 2019 to February 2020 were assessed for SSIs (T814/T826/T827/T846) occurring during the index event or in the 90 days post-discharge. We included 20 centers with > 300 procedures. Combined outcomes data were used to update a published health-economic model of the CABG care pathway. SSI burden is reported as additional length of stay (LOS), readmissions, and cost.Results: A combined 11,770 SVG procedures were reported across the 20 centers. SSIs occurred in 6.1% (716) of procedures, which increased LOS from 12.2 to 30.0 days. The 351 SSI-related, post-discharge readmissions had a mean LOS of 11.6 days. Based on the inputs above, the estimated cost of care was £8,502 per patient; closely aligned to official reports of £7,830 to £8,784.1Introduction of spECG was estimated to reduce the cost of care to £8,372 per patient; a saving of £130 per patient. This translates to more than a tenfold return on investment. The main drivers for these savings were fewer SSIs, resulting in reduced LOS and fewer readmissions. Individual hospital savings depended on the SSI rate reported.Conclusions: The model results estimate that the routine use of spECG may reduce the cost burden of SSIs following CABG using the SVG method.1R040X: Specialty group costs - inpatients in all specialties (exc long stay), cardiac surgery data used.P043Significance of admission troponin I in critically unwell COVID-19 patientsE.H.

Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test in Microsoft Excel.Results: 41 patients had admission TnI measured. The patient male:female ratio was 31:10. The median patient age was 58. Peak admission TnI levels for patients were 8662.9 for men and 27.9 for women. Median admission TnI was 18.84 for males and 7.75 for females. The interquartile ranges between admission TnI were 20.05 and 4.625 for males and females respectively. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients against measured outcomes, with admission TnI.Conclusions: This small study contributes to the body of evidence that supports TnI as an indicator for outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Those with a high admission TnI have statistical significance with cardiac events during their ICU stay. There is a trend towards a higher admission TnI being associated with higher mortality, although there was no statistical significance.ReferencesNie S et al. Circulation 142:608–610, 2020Du R et al.

HabbalCardiology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, MoroccoCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P044Introduction: Patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS) can present with different degrees of symptomatology, they can be asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic or have severe dyspnea. The right ventricular (RV) systolic function is an important determinant of clinical symptoms, exercise capacity, preoperative survival, as well as postoperative outcomes in patients with MS. The aim of our study was to compare RV function in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with isolated MS.Methods: We led a prospective observational study over a period of 2 years from October 2018 to January 2021, collected from the day hospital and echocardiography vacations in the cardiology department of Ibn Rochd University Hospital of Casablanca. We included all patients with pure severe and very severe MS, divided into two groups according to their functional capacity: Group 1 (asymptomatic group) with NYHA class I and group"

The RV systolic function was evaluated by both Doppler tissue imaging and pulsed Doppler. A RV dysfunction was defined by a TAPSE < 16 mm and S’ < 9.5 cm/s according to the current recommendations.Results: The study included 468 patients; among them, 145 patients had severe isolated MS, mean age was 42.1 years (± 14.3); sex ratio M/F was 0.8 and women were found more symptomatic than men (84.4% versus 69.23%). Group 1 consisted of 44 patients (30.3%) versus 101 patients in group 2 (69.7%). RV was dilated in 31.81% patients of the first group versus 22.77% of group 2. RV systolic dysfunction was found in 29.7% of symptomatic patients versus 22.7% in asymptomatic patients (p = 0.02).Conclusions: Patients with an impaired RV function are more symptomatic than those with better RV systolic function, thus proving the importance of the RV function assessment in such patients.P045Evaluation of the prognosis role of obesity in pulmonary embolism in a Moroccan populationR.

HabbalCardiology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, MoroccoCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P045Introduction: Obesity is associated with many cardiovascular risk factors that could trigger venous thrombo-embolism such as venous stasis and decreased mobility. Its prevalence is quickly rising in developed countries and all over the world. Obesity is known to be an independent risk factor for pulmonary embolism (PE). However, few studies have studied the prognosis role of this parameter in PE.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 308 patients hospitalized between July 2017 and February 2021 for acute pulmonary embolism in the cardiology department of University hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca. We divided our populations into 2 groups depending on their body mass index (BMI): Group 1 (G1) with obesity: BMI > 30 kg/m2, and group 2 (G2) without obesity BMI < 30 kg/m2. We compared their clinical, electric, echocardiographic and prognosis data.Results: Mean age was 54.3 ± 16.77, sex ratio = 0.3. 28% of patients were in G1. Clinically, 56% in G1 versus 43% in G2 had dyspnea, 20% vs. 10% had edema, 12% vs. 2% had hemoptysis and 10% vs. 3% presented with signs of cardiogenic shock (p < 0.001). ECG signs of acute cor pulmonale were not more frequent in G1 than in G2. Diagnosis was assessed by echocardiography and Chest Computed tomography angiography (CTA). A cardiac thrombi was found in 8% vs. 2%, right ventricular dysfunction in 24% vs. 15% (p = 0.016). Paradoxal septum and pulmonary hypertension occurred in more than 56% of G1 vs. 34% in G2 (p = 0.004). Thrombolysis was used in 4% of G1, unlike patients in G2 who didn’t undergone thrombolysis (p < 0.001).

Loncar Stojiljkovic1, M. P. Stojiljkovic21Institute for Cardiovascular Surgery Dedinje, Belgrade, Serbia;2Faculty of Medicine, University of Banja Luka, Pharmacology, Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology, Banja Luka, Bosnia and HerzegovinaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P046Introduction: Pain after cardiac surgery is significant and may affect postoperative cardiovascular stability and may develop into chronic pain thereafter [1]. This postoperative pay should be carefully managed. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effects and safety of morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.Methods: Study was prospective, randomized and double-blinded. Forty-five patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were included in the study. All patients received a standardized anesthesia. They were randomized into 3 groups consisting of 15 patients each. M group received morphine HCl (1 mg/ml) with an infusion rate of 0.3 mg/h and 1-mg bolus doses; F group received fentanyl (50 µg/ml) with an infusion rate of 1 µg/kg/h and 10-µg bolus; and R group received remifentanil (50 µg/ml) with an infusion rate of 0.05 µg/kg/min and 0.5-µg/kg bolus, respectively. Continuous infusion was started immediately after transfer to ICU.Results: Pain was assessed by using a numerical scale (0–10) and sedation was assessed with the Ramsey sedation score (1–6) 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h after extubation. The number of boluses and demands, time to extubation and side effects were analyzed. Numerical scale for pain scores, sedation scores and mean extubation times were similar in all groups. Total number of boluses and demands were statistically higher in the R group. Nausea and vomiting occurred more often in group M group (p < 0.05), whereas pruritus was most frequently registered in group F (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Despite the different durations of action of these three opioid agents, the infusion dose of remifentanil was as effective as morphine and fentanyl after CABG surgery, with fewer side effects.Referencede Hoogd S et al.

HabbalCardiology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, MoroccoCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P048Introduction: Anemia is a well-known marker as an independent risk factor in coronary patients. The aim of our work was to determine the relationship between hemoglobin levels and the evolution of patients admitted into the cardiology intensive care department at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital.Methods: We prospectively included 364 patients admitted to the cardiology intensive care unit of Ibn Rochd Hospital in Casablanca between September 2019 and January 2021 for ACS with or without persistent ST segment elevation (STEMI n = 128 and NSTEMI n = 236). The patients were subdivided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 119) with a hemoglobin level < 11 g/dl and group 2 (n = 245) with a hemoglobin level > 11 g/dl.Results: Among the 364 included patients, the average age was 60.27 ± 12.35 years, with a male predominance (64.7% of the population). The anemic subjects were older than the non-anemic: 63 ± 9.9 years versus 57 ± 11 years. The renal function was more impaired in anemic patients with a clearance of creatinine to 54.66 ml per minute versus 93.62 ml per minute in non-anemic patients. Group 1 patients had more frequently signs of left ventricular (LV) heart failure than group 2 (46% versus 10%). Systolic LV function, however, seemed unaffected by this rate with a mean ejection fraction measured in both groups (43% in group 1 versus 45% in group 2). Diastolic function was more often impaired with higher LV filling pressures in anemic patients (66% versus 30%). The mean length of stay was longer for patients with anemia (12.5 ± 10.1 days versus 7.9 ± 4 days).Conclusions: Anemia at admission for ACS is linked to a pejorative prognosis.

HabbalCardiology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, MoroccoCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P049Introduction: During acute myocardial ischemia, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is accompanied by diastolic dysfunction which sometimes precedes systolic dysfunction. The recent development of Doppler echocardiography has allowed the noninvasive measurement of LV diastolic filling, which correlates well with other measures of LV filling. The aim of our study was to evaluate LV filling pressures (LVFP) and to demonstrate the prognostic value of their elevation in the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).Methods: We prospectively included 364 patients admitted to the cardiology intensive care unit of Ibn Rochd Hospital in Casablanca between September 2019 and January 2021 for ACS with or without persistent ST segment elevation. All patients had Doppler echocardiography within the first four days of admission.Results: The average age of our patients was 60.27 ± 12.35 years [28–85 years]. There was a male predominance (64.7% of the population). More than two-thirds of the patients were smokers (76.36%). One-quarter were hypertensive (23.63%), nearly half were diabetic (50.9%), and one quarter of our population had dyslipidemia. Coronary inheritance was found in 7.27% of our patients. 16.36% of our patients had high LVFP. Elevation of LVFP was a significant predictor of mortality (p = 0.01) in addition to the occurrence of major cardiovascular events at 6 months of follow-up in our study population (p = 0.001).Conclusions: The study of diastolic function and especially the evaluation of the LVFP at the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome allows to refine the stratification of patients admitted for an acute coronary syndrome and to identify a group of high-risk patients to benefit from more intensive treatment.P050Evaluation of the association between C-reactive protein levels and coronary lesions severity and mortality in acute coronary syndromesR.

However, few data have examined the predictive performance of these tests in our center. The aim of this study was to assess the prognosis impact of serum lipid levels in patients admitted for ACS in our unit.Methods: We prospectively included 364 patients admitted to the cardiology intensive care unit of Ibn Rochd Hospital in Casablanca between September 2019 and January 2021 for ACS. We divided them into 2 groups: Group 1 (N = 158) defined by lipid abnormalities at admission (CHT > 2 g/l, HDL > 0.65, LDL > 1.8 or TG > 2 g/l) and Group 2 (N = 206) defined by normal values of lipid parameters. We compared their clinical, echocardigraphic, biological, angiographic and evolutionary data.Results: Patients in group 1 were younger than the second group (56.8 years vs 63 years respectively), more often presenting with hypertension (56.2% vs 43%), diabetes mellitus (54.1% vs 33.9%), and dyslipidemia (17.28% vs 1.45%) but with less chronic smokers (35.7% versus 60.7%). LVEF was not significantly different in both groups. Both average HS troponin (1582 vs 897 ng/l) and CRP (84.3 vs 42 mg/l) were higher in group 1.

The aim of our study was to define the kinetics and diagnostic value of GPBB in diagnosing myocardial ischemia using a model of transient ischemia induced by ergometric stress testing.Methods: The study included 30 subjects with a positive ergometric test result and coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography (ischemic group), and 15 healthy volunteers with a negative ergometric test result (control group). Plasma GPBB concentration was measured basally at one point, prior to the stress test, and at 9 points after the stress test for the next 6 h.Results: The kinetics of GPBB was significantly different between the ischemic group and the control group (p < 0.001). Analysis of the GPBB dynamics curve in the ischemic group shows a statistically significant difference in comparison with the basal concentration in the measurement taken after 0.5 h, and is also observed in the measurements taken 1 and 1.5 h after ergometric stress testing, while disappearing in the measurement taken after 2 h (Fig. 1).

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognosis value of PESI score in patients admitted for PE in our Unit.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 308 patients hospitalized between July 2017 and February 2021 for acute pulmonary embolism in the cardiology department of University hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca. Risk stratification of our the patients was performed using the PESI score based on age, sex, history of cancer, heart failure, chronic lung disease, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation and mental status.Results: 308 patients (mean age 54.3 ± 16.7 years, 77.5% female) with a confirmed PE were included in this study. As for risk factors for thromboembolic disease, 23.3% had cancer history, prolonged bed rest in 25%, oral contraception in 14%, obesity in 28.1%. Right ventricular dysfunction was assessed by echocardiography in 41.6% cases and pulmonary hypertension in 66.7%. D-dimer was high in half our patients. The PESI score averaged 98 points. It was class I in 11.6%, class II in 25.8%, class III in 41.6% and class IV to V in 20.8%. Twenty-seven patients were transferred to intensive care units, from which 19 had a class IV to V PESI score. The evolution was marked by the death of 9 patients with class V PESI.Conclusions: The PESI score is significantly correlated with mortality. Our data indicate that the PESI can be used to predict the prognosis of patients with PE and in making decisions in the medical management of these patients.P054High and intermediate-high pulmonary embolism treated with alteplase in a tertiary hospital acute intermediate care unitA.

The guidelines advice that SF should be reserved for high risk PE and for those with intermediate risk that evolved with hemodynamic instability.Methods: Retrospective review of acute PE treated with 100 mg rtPA (2010–2019) in an acute intermediate care unit.Results: Revision of demographic, clinical and imaging data, bleeding events and 30 days mortality of 98 patients; 68.4% female, mean age 62.96 y (± 19.43, door-to-needle time 727 min (± 559 min). Minor bleeding: 27 (27.6%), major bleeding: 6 (6.1%). No intracranial or fatal events found. Mortality of 7.1% at 30 days.

Dead at 30 days: the former showed lower baseline Hb and arterial pressure, and higher FiO2needs.Conclusions: The authors highlight the absence of ICH in patients undergoing SF and the low percentage of major bleeding, compared to that found in the PEITHO study [1] and in the international registry, ICOPER [2]. This could be explained by the non-overlapping of rtPA with hypocoagulation,which explains our high time door to needle.The authors are convinced that thrombolysis could be considered in asubgroup of patients with intermediate risk PE with tachycardia, lactatemia and left preload compromise, despite the absence of hypotension or shock.ReferencesMeyer G et al.

Lavasani Rad, A. M. Majeed, L. Rengarajan, U. Kahara, A. ChaudoryQueen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Emergency Department, Birmingham, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P055Introduction: Thromboembolic event (TE) is a major challenge in COVID19 patients but the data remains inadequate. Published data suggests a variable risk (around 20% prevalence [1]) of TE associated with coronavirus infection. Lack of robust evidence makes it difficult to develop a standardized approach in managing these patients in Emergency Department (ED). In this study, we aim to assess incidence of TE among patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to hospital.Methods: We conducted a single center retrospective study in the ED of Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, evaluating TE in patients with COVID-19 infection who required hospitalization between March 2020 and March 2021. We only present initial 20% of cases that data analysis conducted electronically.Results: A total of 527 patients included. 43% of patients were between 40 to 65 yrs followed by 23% of patients with age range of 65-80yrs. We performed D-dimmer test in 379 (71%) patients in the ED, 250 (65%) patients had positive D-dimer test with a wide range of levels as described in Table 1. CTPA performed in 22% patients, pulmonary embolism (PE) reported in 34% patients. 2 patients reported to have confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by Doppler ultrasound scan, although they had no correlation with confirmed PE cases. Only 71% were suspected to have TE and 21 cases had confirmed diagnosis. Overall TE rate was 4% (0.4% DVT & 3.6% PE).Conclusions: We believe our study is the first to discuss TE on patient presentation in the ED. The previous published data suggests overal incidence of TE around 20% [1].

Lahmer21Klinikum Rechts der Isar, II. Med. Klinik, Munich, Germany;2Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich, GermanyCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P056Introduction: BST provides a rough estimate of CI. With non-contact infrared thermometers (“Thermofocus”, Tecnimed) BSTs can be measured more accurately than just by clinical examination. We hypothesized BSTs combined with biometric data and basic monitoring parameters might be able to track changes in cardiac index as well as the Clearsight- or Flotrac-system (both Edwards Lifesciences) using the trans-cardiopulmonary thermodilution derived changes of CI_TD (ΔCI_TD) of PiCCO (Pulsion) as gold-standard.Methods: From 7/2017 till 1/2018 in 31 patients (APACHE II 29 ± 5) 248 data sets were recorded (8 per patient within 24 h). Immediately before transcardiopulmonary thermodilution CI_CS and CI_FT were recorded, BSTs were measured on forehead, forearm (middle and distal), index and great toe, and basic monitoring parameters were recorded and resulted in CI_CNI using multiple regression analysis. After calculating the percentage of changes in CI, trending was assessed with concordance analysis with four quadrant plot, polar plot analysis and polar concordance rate. We established exclusion zones for all ΔCI < 0.1%. Statistics: IBM SPSS 25, Microsoft Excel.Results: Concordance in four quadrant plot was < 95% for all devices and CI_CNI, Polar concordance was < 92% for all devices and CI_CNI, Angular Bias was acceptable for CI_CNI and CI_FT, Radial LoA were acceptable for CI_FT and almost for CI_CNI as in the Table.Conclusions: Concordance rates and polar concordance rates were far too low for all devices and CI_CNI. CI_CNI and CI_FT showed acceptable angular bias (< 5°). CI_FT showed acceptable radial limits of agreement within the ± 30° borders, CI_CNI was close. CI_CS had neither an acceptable angular bias nor acceptable limits of agreement. In contrast to CI_CS, CI_¬CNI provides comparable estimates of changes in cardiac index to CI_FT.Acknowledgements: Accuracy and precision for CI_CNI for a smaller data set were presented at ISICEM 2018.Table 1(abstract P056)ResultsCI_CNICI_CSCI_FTConcordance (4QP)40%39.4%39.1%Angular bias3.2°19.8°4.5°Radial LoA31.9°− 9.53°to 49.15°± 28°Polar concordance (PP)36.2%30.3%36.5%P057Improvement of accuracy and precision of cardiac power index (CPI) calculated from Flotrac- and Clearsight data by using a non-invasive estimate of CI compared to CPI derived from transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD)J.

We calculated CPI_FT and CPI_CS from Flotrac- and Clearsight data and CPI_TD as gold-standard from CI derived by TPTD (CPI = MAP*CI*k). For MAP_CS Bland–Altman analysis showed acceptable bias (3.8 mmHg) and quite good SD (12.13 mmHg), PE (28.4%) and LoA (-20.1 mmHg to 27.6 mmHg) for MAP_CS leading to minimal deviation in error grid analysis (zone “A”: 79.0%, “B”: 18.5%, “C”: 2.4%, no pairs in zone “D” and “E”). But due to poor results of CI-data of FT & CS (CI_FT: bias 0.03 l/min/m2, PE 63.3%, LoA -2.64 to 2.71 l/min/m2; CI_CS: bias 0.81 l/min/m2, PE 51.4%, LoA -1.36 to 2.98 l/min/m2) we hypothesized, that we could improve CPI_FT and CPI_CS by combining their corresponding CIs with a regression derived estimate of CI (CI_CNI, bias 0.035 l/min/m2, PE 46.1%, LoA -1.91 to 1.98 l/min/m2)) based on BST, biometrics and basic monitoring data (CI_FT_CNI & CI_CS_CNI). Using CI_FT_CNI and CI_CS_CNI we then calculated CPI_FT_CNI and CPI_CS_CNI.Results: CPI_FT had a bias of 0.01 W/m2with LoA from -0.48 to 0.51 W/m2and PE of 63.6%. CPI_CS had a bias of 0.17 W/m2with LoA from -0.23 to 0.57 W/m2and PE of 51.5%. CPI_FT_CNI had a bias of 0.00 W/m2with LoA from -0.33 to 0.34 W/m2and PE of 43.2%. CPI_CS_CNI had a bias of 0.03 W/m2with LoA from -0.33 to 0.40 W/m2and PE of 47.2%.Conclusions: CPI_FT had smaller and acceptable bias than CPI_CS, but bigger PE and wider LoA (as their corresponding CIs). Using combined information for CI from CI_CNI and FT or CS data improved accuracy of CPI_CS and little for CPI_FT, but precision was still poor for both.Acknowledgement: Derivation and validation of CI_CNI on a smaller data set have been presented at ISICEM 2018, for CI_FT_CNI and CI_CS_CNI at ESICM 2018.P058Personalized hemodynamics - influence of underlying disease on hemodynamic parametersJ.

PUL and SEP groups showed decreased GEF (p = 0.009) and prolonged ICU stay (p < 0.025). A median split dividing short and long term ICU stays failed to prove a significant difference in mortality among the groups (p < 0.914). The established T3PDS showed a 1.21 × increase for SEP (p = 0.028) and a 1.24 × increase of probability for PUL (p = 0.023) to die with higher scores. The T3PDS cut-off analysis showed a probability of death increase with > 6.4 pts (AUC: 0.86 ± 0.1, 95%, p = 0.021).Conclusions: The study shows that the commonly used algorithms in achieving hemodynamic stability provide a solid therapeutic concept irrespective of the underlying cause. In case of septic patients we recommend early and continuous monitoring in case of typical signs of tachycardia, hypotension and high CVP. We advise to consider a prolonged stay for septic patients.

SlagtAnesthesiologie, Pijn en Palliatieve Geneeskunde, RadboudUMC, HEMS Lifeliner 3 en 5, Nijmegen, NetherlandsCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P059Introduction: The Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) Lifeliner 3 of the Radboud University Medical Center organized the first intensive care (IC) helicopter (Lifeliner 5) to transport critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. In-hospital, pre-hospital and inter-hospital transfer of IC patients all bear the risk of complications. Most of the complications have impact on patients vital signs [1–3]. The goal of this study is to analyze the impact of the helicopter transfer of COVID-19 IC patients on the vital signs during take-off, midflight and landing.Methods: This prospective observational study was performed during the second COVID-19 outburst in the Netherlands. All inter-hospital helicopter transfers of COVID-19 IC patients who were monitored including non-invasive electrical cardiometry cardiac output (CO) were included in this study. Patients were included from November 2020–June 2021. Three predefined time frames were analyzed. The first time frame of 10 min started with the actual take-off. The second 10 min frame represents mid-flight. The third 10 min time frame ends with the actual landing.

PatilDept of Anaesthesia, Tata Memorial Center, Critical Care and Pain, Mumbai, IndiaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P060Introduction: Mediastinal shift, especially a large one, can cause obstructive shock due to cardiac herniation or twisting of great vessels [1]. Early identification of mediastinal shift may help in initializing rapid therapy for reversal of shift to prevent significant hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest. We report two cases of right-sided mediastinal shift identified using Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) based on the location of parasternal cardiac window and probe direction of subcostal window.Methods: Case 1. A young adult had sudden hypotension on postoperative day 1 of right pneumonectomy. POCUS failed to obtain cardiac image with left parasternal cardiac window. On further interrogation, parasternal cardiac window was obtained in right second intercostal space. Subcostal cardiac view present towards right side instead of usual left side. This raised suspicion of significant mediastinal shift towards right causing obstructive shock, further supported by dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) and good left ventricular contractility ruling out hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock.Case 2. Patient was admitted with febrile neutropenia and septic shock following cytotoxic chemotherapy for hemato-lymphoid malignancy.

Underwood1, N. Abdulla2, P. Parulekar21Emergency Department, Medway Maritime Hospital, Gillingham, UK;2ICU, William Harvey Hospital, Ashford, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P061Introduction: Radial artery cannulation allows for continuous blood pressure monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [1]. Studies have assessed for ischemic complications of radial artery cannulation [2], but there is lack of evidence using ultrasound to determine whether limbs at risk of ischemia are being cannulated and for the presence of collateral ulnar flows. The objective was to assess collateral ulnar flow, compare flow and size of radial and ulnar arteries and to detect limbs at risk of distal ischemia using ultrasound in ICU patients.Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at William Harvey Hospital ICU, UK. From 1/12/2019–9/3/2020, data were collected from patients on ICU. Vascular probe ultrasound was used to determine the size of radial and ulnar arteries bilaterally, presence of adequate color flow and flow velocity through each vessel. Complications associated with the arterial line were noted.Results: A total of 53 patients were included. A total of 34 patients had radial arterial lines in situ. The mean longitudinal diameter for radial and ulnar arteries was 0.23 cm and 0.22 cm, respectively, both larger than the internal diameter of cannulae used (0.8 mm). Eighteen patients had at least one at risk limb (≥ 1 artery with anything less than ‘good’ visual flow on color Doppler). 50% had an arterial line present in at risk limb. There were no major complications noted.Conclusions: 24% of patients had at least one ‘at risk’ limb with 15% of upper limbs having moderate/poor collateral ulnar flow. This indicates a significant proportion of patients on ICU at risk of digital ischemia and the need for assessment of radial and ulnar arterial size and flow before cannulation.ReferencesMarino P.

To the best of our knowledge there are no prospective studies evaluating changes over time using ultrasound. We aimed to evaluate right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and resolution of pulmonary hypertension (PH).Methods: We performed a sub-study of a prospective RCT at a Swedish ICU (NO SARS-COVID) examining the effects of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) on the recovery of ICU-patients treated for COVID-19. Adult patients were included within 72 h of intubation and evaluated by echocardiography at study inclusion and at follow-up 3–5 days after randomization.Results: Thirty-nine patients were included, 33 completed follow-up (Table 1). At inclusion, eight patients had RV dysfunction evaluated by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and eight evaluated by right global longitudinal strain (RVGLS). None had LV systolic dysfunction evaluated by ejection fraction (EF), but 10 evaluated by global longitudinal strain (GLS). Thirty-two patients had signs of PH, median (IQR) mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) 35.3 mmHg (28.0–46.8). At follow-up, none had RV failure evaluated by TAPSE in the control group and 1 in the iNO group, but 3 in the control group and 5 in the iNO group evaluated by RVGLS. No patients in either group had LV systolic failure at follow up evaluated by EF, but GLS unmasked dysfunction in 4 patients in the control group and 1 in the iNO group. All patients in the control group had signs of PH, MPAP 56 (38–62) and 17 in the iNO group, MPAP 39 mmHg (28–54).Conclusions: As expected, PH was frequently seen in our cohort of intubated patients with COVID-19 and did not resolve after administration of iNO. We encourage use of strain analysis to assess chamber function more accurately beside conventional echocardiography parameters to unmask subclinical cardiac dysfunction.Table 1(abstract P062)Patient characteristicsAllInhaled nitric oxideControlAge (years)61 (50–69)61 (50–69)60 (49–69)Male31 (79%)17 (81%)14 (78%)BMI (kg/m2)29.7 (27.1–34.4)29.2 (26.6–34.2)30.8 (27.3–35.0)SAPS III66 (58–72)66.0 (59.0–77.0)68.0 (57.0–71.0)APACHE II31 (30–36)33.0 (31.0–36.5)29.5 (26.7–30.0Vasoactive inotropic score6 (2–11)4 (1–10)8 (3–15)Values are presented as median with (IQR) or numbers (percentages) of patients.

After the insertion of a central venous catheter, chest radiograph is usually obtained to ensure correct positioning of the catheter tip.Methods: Ninety-nine consecutive patients undergoing CVC positioning, using a landmark or ultrasound-guided technique. A post-procedural TEE was obtained in all patients and was considered as reference technique. A TTE through the subcostal acoustic window along the short heart axis or through the apical four-chamber view was performed at the end of the procedure in order to infer correct catheter tip position. All patients also underwent CXR.Results: Using TEE as a reference standard, and considering intravascular and intracardiac malpositioning altogether, catheter tip malpositions were detected in 27 patients by TTE through the subcostal acoustic window along the short heart axis, in 8 patients by TTE through the apical four-chamber view and in 17 patients by CXR. For the detection of catheter tip malposition, TTE through the subcostal acoustic window has shown to be by far the most accurate method providing 96% sensitivity, 98% specificity and 96% diagnostic accuracy if compared with the apical four-chamber view TTE or CXR. Concordance with TEE was 94% (p < 0.001).Conclusions: The close concordance between TTE through the subcostal acoustic window and TEE justifies the use of ultrasounds as a standard technique to ensure the correct positioning of the catheter tip after central venous catheter cannulation, in order to optimize use of hospital resources and minimize radiation. CXR will be necessary when sonographic examination is impossible to perform by technical limitations.Table 1(abstract P063)Diagnostic accuracy and concordanceSensitivity (%)Specificity (%)Accuracy (%)k-Cohen (%)CE-TTE subcostal96989694CE-TTE apical18976918CXR38947733P064Reliability of bioreactance and pulse power analysis in measuring cardiac index during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypassL.

Pulmonary artery catheter is considered as the gold standard for measuring cardiac output, but it is invasive and can be harmful to the patients [2]. Less invasive monitors have recently been developed. We compared the accuracy, precision and trending ability of non-invasive bioreactance-based Starling SV and mini-invasive pulse power device LiDCOrapid to bolus thermodilution technique with pulmonary artery catheter (TDCO) when measuring cardiac index (CI) in the setting of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Methods: Twenty patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were monitored with Starling SV, LiDCOrapid and TDCO intraoperatively in the OR and postoperatively in the ICU resulting in simultaneous 513 CI measurements. We used the Bland–Altman method to investigate the agreement between the devices and four-quadrant plots with error grids to assess the trending ability.Results: The agreement between TDCO and Starling SV was associated with a bias of 0.43 l/min/m2(95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.50), wide limits of agreement (LOA, –1.07 to 1.94 L/min/m2) and a percentage error (PE) of 66.3%. (Fig. 1a) The agreement between TDCO and LiDCOrapid was associated with a bias of 0.22 l/min/m2(95% CI 0.16–0.27), wide LOA (–0.93 to 1.43 l/min/m2) and a PE of 53.2% (Fig. 1b). Trending ability was not acceptable, since with Starling SV only 26% and with LiDCOrapid 39% of measurements changed in the same direction to the same extent as with TDCO.Conclusions: CI measurements with bioreactance-based Starling SV and pulse power device LiDCOrapid were not interchangeable with TDCO, and their ability to track changes in CI was poor. These results do not support their use in monitoring CI reliably during and after cardiac surgery with CPB.ReferencesMarik PE. J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth 27:121–134, 2013Swan HJC et al.

The present study aimed to assess sublingual and intestinal organ microcirculation during low CVP or GDT fluid management in patients undergoing major liver resection.Methods: In this single-center, surgeon and patient-blinded, randomized controlled trial, patients undergoing major open liver resections (≥ 3 segments) were randomized to receive either GDT or low-CVP. As a substudy of this trial, sublingual and intestinal microcirculation were assessed using the handheld video microscope, IDF imaging. The sublingual and intestinal microcirculations were measured after skin incision (T0) and before skin closure (T1); 24 h after surgery sublingual microcirculation was measured again (T2). Patients’ baseline characteristics, intra-operative parameters and outcomes were analyzed.Results: A total of 38 patients were included for analysis, 18 in the GDT group and 20 in the low-CVP group. Sublingual microcirculation in the GDT group showed a significant decrease in total vessel density 24 h after surgery, and a significant decrease in intestinal microcirculatory density at the end of surgery. The GDT group showed a more positive fluid balance intraoperatively when compared to the low-CVP group. No differences in sublingual and intestinal microcirculation were found in the low-CVP group. Patient outcomes showed no differences between the groups.Conclusions: Perioperative monitoring of organ microcirculation revealed altered intestinal and sublingual microcirculation in the GDT group, whereas the low-CVP group showed no changes. Outcome of patients were similar between the study groups, suggesting recovery of the microcirculation in the GDT group over time. Monitoring of the organ microcirculation is a potential measure to control and evaluate the effects of fluid therapy on the perfusion.P066Fluid responsiveness assessment by passive leg raising and mini-fluid challenge in major surgery, a prospective studyL.

The Starling™SV monitor (Cheetah Medical-Baxter) identifies FRs thanks to bioreactance technology.Methods: Preoperative PLR test was performed to patients undergoing major surgery before the anesthesia induction. FRs received 250 ml of balanced crystalloid solution and fluid responsiveness was re-tested at the end of the bolus and again until a non-FR state was achieved. Baseline intraoperative fluid therapy was set at 5 ml/kg/h until the end of surgery. Hourly, mFCs with 100 ml of crystalloids balanced solutions were performed and FRs received the 250 ml-fluid bolus. Blood [Hb]-concentration was measured before surgery and hourly.Results: Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Fifty% of the patients were FRs and average fasting time was 12 (3.16) h in FRs and 13.8 (4.35) h in non-FRs (Fig. 1). After the first crystalloid bolus, 9 (82%) FRs became non-FRs. Intraoperatively, 47 mFCs were performed in the first 3 h and 9 FRs were found (19%). In all FRs, after the bolus, the mFC test was re-performed and no patient resulted to be FR. The [Hb] variation before and after 60 min from surgery start was 0.71 (0.66) g/dl for FRs and 0.32 (0.56) g/dl for non-FRs.Conclusions: Preoperative fasting does not correlate with PLR test. After having tested for fluid responsiveness and corrected volemia, [Hb]-concentration can be used as a sensitive indicator of fluid expansion-restriction in non-bleeding patients. PLR and mFC tests, are easy, reliable and may be efficient tools to guide volume optimization during major surgery.Fig. 1(abstract P066)Average fasting timesP067Timing of dynamic measurement of stroke volume and patient outcome: results from examination of a large administrative databaseJ.

We sought to evaluate the timing of the initiation of dynamic methods using a large number of patients within the Premier dataset.Methods: We used the 2013–2019 Premier Hospital Discharge database to analyze the timing of initiating dynamic methods to guide fluid administration in 1,123 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock who were admitted to an ICU from the ER. Patients who received dynamic monitoring initiated days 1–2 were compared to those who received dynamic monitoring on days 3 and later.Results: The analysis set consisted of 1123 discharges from 19 hospitals. The mean patient age was 68.6 years of age and 42.2% were female. There was no significant difference in demographics or organ failures (Fig. 1). Notably, patients who received monitoring on days 1–2 exhibited a decreased ICU length of stay (4.5 vs 10.7 days, p < 0.0001) and need for vasopressors (2.5% vs 17.4%, p < 0.0001) and lower risk of death (27% vs 40%, p = 0.001) compared with patients who had monitoring started on Days 3 + ( Fig. 1).Conclusions: The present results suggest that timing of resuscitation efforts is critically important, as patients who received earlier dynamic monitoring exhibited improved outcomes.Fig. 1(abstract P067)Patient characteristics and outcomesP068Stroke volume variation (SVV): difference of information derived from fingerplethysmography (“Clearsight”), uncalibrated pulse contour analysis (“Flotrac”) and calibrated pulse contour analysis (PiCCO)J.

Klinik, Munich, Germany;2Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich, GermanyCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P068Introduction: Values of SVV higher than 13% in some cases predict fluid responsiveness. SVV is derived from pulse contour analysis of arterial blood pressure curve. The uncalibrated “Flotrac”-device (Edward Lifesciences) estimates SV (and so SVV) with an unpublished formula. In contrast to the PiCCO device (Pulsion), where SV (and so SVV) is derived from pulse contour analysis calibrated to individual patient. But also with fingerplethysmographically (“Clearsight”, Edward Lifesciences) derived blood pressure signals SVV can be obtained (using uncalibrated pulse contour analysis).Methods: We compared 256 simultaneously derived measurements of SVV from Clearsight (SVV_CS), Flotrac (SVV_FT) and PiCCO (SVV_PiCCO) as gold-standard, directly after calibration of the PiCCO-device in 32 ICU patients. Primary endpoint: Concordance of the measurements within the categories “ < 9%”, “9–13%” and “ > 13%”.

So the objective of our study was to assess whether hemodynamic changes during a short elevation of PEEP would predict fluid responsiveness in patients with ARDS.Methods: This prospective observational study conducted from april 2018 to april 2020 enrolled 30 patients presenting a mild ARDS according the classification of Berlin.They were 60 ± 10 years old and were submitted to a protective ventilation with PEEP 8, with the use of “tidal volume challenge” to improve the reliability of pulse pressure variation (PPV) [1]. A PEEP challenge was performed in patients hemodynamically stable, and consisted of increasing PEEP progressively from 8 cmH2O to 12 cmH2O with a time of ten minutes to reach 12 cmH2O. We recorded continuously, systolic pressure variation (SPV), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PPV from the arterial wave line. We measured also cardiac index (CI) with echocardiography. Central venous pressure (CVP), PPV, SPV, MAP, and CI, were evaluated at PEEP 8 and at PEEP 12.Results: Statistical analysis was performed using student’s t test. Results were expressed as mean ± std deviation. We observed finally that PEEP challenge from PEEP 8 (control) increases PPV, SPV, CVP and decreases MAP (Fig. 1). MAP (mmHg) decreases from 70.23 + -2.02 to 63.56 + -2.01 (p < 0.001). PPV (%) increases from 10.023 ± 1.24 to 17.65 ± 1.62 (p < 0.001). SPV (%) increases from 9.42 ± 1.25 to 15.72 ± 1.7 (p < 0.001). CVP (cmH2O) increases from 10.62 ± 1.14 to 14.23 ± 1.32 (p < 0.003) and finally CI (l/min/m2) decreases from 3.8 ± 0.3 to 2.5 ± 0.2, p < 0.003.Conclusions: In patients with mild ARDS, PEEP challenge could detect"

Our study aimed to evaluate the ability of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and its changes during a 1-min tidal volume (TV) challenge (TVC) to assess preload responsiveness in ARDS patients under prone position.Methods: Patients with ARDS ventilated with a 6 ml/kg TV under prone position were prospectively included. By using a pulse contour analysis monitor, we measured PPV and changes in CI during a Trendelenburg maneuver (ΔCITREND). After transiently increasing TV to 8 ml/kg, we measured first absolute changes in PPV during TVC (ΔPPV TVC6-8) and then changes in CI during end-expiratory occlusion (EEO) (ΔCI EEO8). Preload responsiveness was defined by both ΔCITREND ≥ 8% [1] and ΔCI EEO8 ≥ 5% [2]. Preload unresponsiveness was defined by both ΔCITREND < 8% and ΔCI EEO8 < 5%.Results: Eight-four cases were analyzed in 58 patients (65 ± 11 y.o.) under prone position for 11 (2–14) hours. The mean arterial pressure was 82 (75–90) mmHg (under norepinephrine in 83% cases). The driving pressure was 12 (10–18) cmH2O, the respiratory system compliance was 32 (21–40) ml/cmH2O and the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen was 104 ± 27 mmHg. Forty-two cases were classified as preload responders. The baseline PPV predicted preload responsiveness with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 ± 0.04 (threshold 5%; sensitivity: 74%, specificity: 79%). The ΔPPV TVC6-8 predicted preload responsiveness with an AUROC of 0.94 ± 0.03 (threshold 2%; sensitivity: 98%, specificity: 88%) (p = 0.03 vs. PPV).Conclusions: In patients with ARDS under protective ventilation during prone position, the changes in PPV during a 1-min TVC could reliably assess preload responsiveness without the need of CI measurements.ReferencesYonis H et al.

Primary endpoint was the occurrence of ICUCA. Secondary endpoints included conditions associated with ICUCA, rates of no-return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC), risk factors of no-ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, 1-year survival and cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 year after cardiac arrest.Results: We observed 114 ICUCA out of 14,264 ICU-admissions and 64,809 occupancy days according to an incidence of 0.8% of ICU-admissions (95%CI: 0.7–1.0) and 0.2% of ICU occupancy days (95%CI: 0.1–2). Conditions associated with ICUCA were cardiocirculatory (n = 88 [77%]), induction of anaesthesia (n = 26 [23%]), respiratory failure [n = 19 [17%]) and airway complications (n = 14 [12%]). Thirty-four patients (30%) had no-ROSC. Risk factors of no-ROSC were cardiac (odds ratio (OR): 5.4; 95%CI: 1.4–20.7)/hepatic comorbidities (OR: 7.2; 95%CI: 0.9–54.6), SOFA ≥ 2 (OR: 8.3; 95%CI: 0.9–74.8) and continuous-renal-replacement-therapy before ICUCA (OR: 5.9; 95%CI: 1.7–20.8). Interestingly, HCO3−levels > 21 mmol/l in combination with cardiac comorbidities were associated with a higher mortality-risk (HCO3−< 21 mmol/l: 13%; 21–26 mmol/l: 45%; > 26 mmol/l: 42%) / SOFA ≥ 2 (HCO3−< 21 mmol/l: 8%; 21–26 mmol/l: 36%; > 26 mmol/l: 33%). Hospital-mortality was 78% (n = 89). 1-year-survival-rate was 10% (95%CI: 5.5–17.7), survival with a good neurological (CPC1-2) outcome was 6.1% (95%CI: 2.5–12.2).Conclusions: ICUCA is a rare but serious complication in the ICU. Further research should concentrate on identifying early predictors of survival, such as HCO3−levels, and subsequently on the prevention of ICUCA.P072Identification of physiological subphenotypes in post-cardiac arrest"

StevensDepartment of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USACritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P072Introduction: The management of postcardiac arrest (CA) patients may be ineffective or even harmful due to heterogeneity of treatment effects. Heterogeneity could be mitigated if undifferentiated CA populations could be resolved into biologically more uniform subphenotypes. We hypothesized that computational analysis of physiological time series (PTS) data recorded in the first 3 days of intensive care would uncover latent, clinically meaningful subphenotypes.Methods: Patients admitted to ICU after CA were identified in the multi-center Philips eICU database, and PTS signals recorded in first 72 h after ICU admission were extracted (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and respiratory rate). Temporal, frequency, and information theory-based PTS features were derived and analyzed using consensus clustering, an unsupervised machine learning approach which reconciles clustering information about the same dataset coming from different sources or from different runs of the same algorithm.Results: From 2,095 CA patients in eICU we derived 91 PTS features, from which 3 unique clusters were identified, each associated with a distinct clinical outcome distribution, leading to the designation of low, intermediate, and high risk subphenotypes (respectively clusters 1, 3 and 2 in Fig. 1). Clusters were differentiable by PTS features but not by demographic and/or other clinical characteristics (Fig. 1C).Conclusions: Among CA patients admitted to ICU, unsupervised learning applied to data routinely recorded in the ICU indicates the presence distinct physiological subphenotypes associated with specific outcome probabilities. These subphenotypes were latent, as they could be differentiated on the basis of clinical features.Fig. 1(abstract P072)A) Proportion plot of identified 3 clusters of CA patients.

Predictive features were extracted from clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data available in the hyperacute phase. Primary endpoints were survival and favorable neurological outcome, determined as a motor Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS) of 6 upon discharge. Three machine learning algorithms were trained: GLM, random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (XGboost). Models with optimal features from forward selection were tenfold cross-validated and resampled 10 times.Results: Data were available on 969 cardiac arrest patients who received TTM, of whom 491 survived and 237 had favorable neurological discharge. The GLM performed best, with an AUROC of 0.702 ± 0.029, sensitivity 0.621 ± 0.116, and specificity 0.666 ± 0.117 for the prediction of survival and an AUROC of 0.678 ± 0.041, sensitivity 0.691 ± 0.149, and specificity 0.565 ± 0.137 for the prediction of favorable neurological function. Highly ranked features predictive of survival and favorable neurological outcome included male gender, higher respiratory rate, and greater systolic blood pressure range.Conclusions: In patients receiving TTM after cardiac arrest, short-term outcomes can be predicted with data routinely collected in the first 6 h after ICU admission. Ongoing model iterations will integrate novel features and include external validation. Hyperacute prediction could increase the effectiveness of clinical decision-making in the post-cardiac arrest setting.P074Measuring non-technical skills during prehospital advanced cardiac life support: a pilot studyM. Vanneste, P. Dewolf, D. Desruelles, L. WautersDepartment of Emergency Medicine, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, BelgiumCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P074Introduction: Emergency mobile medical teams (MMT) are faced with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) daily. Despite their efforts, patient survival is limited. Research has demonstrated that optimal CPR efforts not only require technical skills and knowledge, but also non-technical skills (NTS) such as leadership, teamwork, and task management [1]. This prospective observational study analyses the NTS of MMTs during OHCA, using the validated Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM). Also, the correlation between NTS and outcome is researched.Methods: Adult patients who suffered from an OHCA between July 2016, and June 2018, and treated by MMT from the University Hospital Leuven, were eligible for the study. Resuscitations were video recorded by the team leader using a GoPro body camera.

No significant correlation was found between TEAM and ROSC (p = 0.574) or one month survival (p = 0.225).Conclusions: Although the TEAM score was good, large differences were observed. Task management was scored high, while leadership and team communication received lower scores. Despite the growing evidence, in this study no correlation was found between NTS and survival. Introduction of a NTS program into ACLS courses, with a focus on leadership and communication, might improve NTS. A constructive feedback platform can encourage post-event ‘hot debriefs’ to identify points of improvement. TEAM can be a helpful tool to achieve this.ReferenceDewolf P et al.

We hypothesized that dispatcher-assisted conventional CPR would be better than dispatcher-assisted compression-only CPR as a bystander CPR instruction.Methods: We analyzed the records of 8172 children who received bystander dispatcher-assisted CPR after OHCA using the All-Japan Utstein-style registry for 13 years (2005–2017). Patients were divided into conventional CPR (n = 3077) and compression-only CPR (n = 5095) groups. The primary study endpoint was 1-month neurological intact survival, defined as a Cerebral Performance Categories score of 1–2 (CPC 1–2). Secondary study endpoints were 1-month survival and pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).Results: The CPC 1–2 rate was significantly higher in the conventional CPR group than in the compression-only CPR group (before propensity score [PS] matching, 5.7% [175/3077] vs. 3.1% [160/5095], p < 0.0001; after PS matching, 6.0% [156/2618] vs. 2.6% [69/2618], p < 0.0001).

Mäkiaho21Department of Diagnostics and Therapeutics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;2University of Helsinki, Helsinki, FinlandCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P076Introduction: In case of prolonged out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), the patient is commonly transported to hospital using mechanical CPR and ventilation with 100% oxygen. Despite this many patients arriving to hospital have severe hypercapnia and hypoxia. One possible reason for this is impaired ventilation due to the counterpressure caused by the continuous chest compressions. We hypothesized that a compression/ventilation ratio of 30:2 would provide better ventilation and gas exchange compared to continuous compressions over ventilation during prolonged CPR.Methods: We randomized 30 anesthetized domestic swine (weight approximately 50 kg) with electrically induced ventricular fibrillation to continuous or intermittent chest compressions and bag-valve-mask ventilation with 100% FiO2. We started CPR after a 5-min no-flow period and continued it up to 40 min from the induction of VF. Chest compressions were performed with a mechanical chest compression device (LUCAS®, Stryker Medical). We collected arterial blood gas samples every 5 min during CPR. We compared PaO2, PaCO2and lactate over time using a mixed linear model.Results: There were no statistically significant differences in PaO2(p = 0.40), PaCO2(p = 0.79) or lactate (p = 0.37) between continuous and 30:2 compression/ventilation (Fig. 1). The significance values for the interaction between compression/ventilation group and time were as follows: p = 0.43 for PaO2; p = 0.37 for PaCO2; p = 0.55 for lactate.Conclusions: Prolonged CPR with mechanical chest compressions performed either continuously or with a 30:2 compression/ventilation ratio resulted in similar arterial levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide and lactate.Fig. 1(abstract P076)PaCO2, lactate and PaO2median values and IQRs in the 30:2 compression/ventilation and continuous compression/ventilation groups at baseline measurements and at 5 min intervals after the cardiac arrest.

International resuscitation guidelines suggest that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may play a role in improving survival and rate of favorable neurological outcome (identified as Cerebral Performance Categories or CPC score = 1–2) [2], but there are still uncertainties about the precise benefit size. We designed a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to evaluate whether long-term survival and long-term neurological outcome are better in adult patients with cardiac arrest treated with ECPR compared to those treated with conventional CPR (CCPR).Methods: We performed a literature search on Pubmed of all ECPR trials published between 2005 and 2019. Only trials with a control group treated with CCPR were considered eligible. Eighteen out of 1238 examined studies were included. All data about survival and neurological outcome at 1 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years from cardiac arrest were extracted from each study. We performed separate meta-analyses for studies with matched and unmatched data for each outcome and time point.Results: ECPR was shown to improve survival at 1 month (RR = 0.83, CI 95%: 0.73 – 0.94), at 6 months (RR = 0.81, CI 95%: 0.70 – 0.93) and at 1 year from cardiac arrest (RR = 0.87, CI 95%: 0.78 – 0.97). We also found an association between ECPR implementation and favorable neurological outcome (CPC score = 1–2) at 1 month (RR = 0.89, CI 95%: 0.85 – 0.93) and 6 months (RR = 0.89, CI 95%: 0.81 – 0.97) from cardiac arrest (Fig. 1).Conclusions: ECPR is an advanced treatment that appears to be associated with increased long-term survival and long-term favorable neurological outcome (identified as CPC score = 1–2). To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to analyze long-term survival and neurological outcome after ECPR.ReferencesBenjamin EJ et al.

Up to 80% of ihCA are preceded by easily identifiable signs of clinical deterioration. A Rapid Response Team (RRT) may help to minimize in-hospital morbidity and mortality. However, the RRT activation is delayed or even not activated in 30–78% of patients who might benefit. A Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) may allow the early detection of these patients with a high mortality risk, prevent ihCA and allow prompt admission to the ICU.Methods: Retrospective, observational, single center study. Data were collected from the RRT activation registries and hospital clinical database. We included all adult RRT activations between January 2018 and December 2020. Clinical signs during the 24 h before the index activation were collected for patients with ihCA.Results: During the study period there were 144 RRT adult activations, including 54 ihCA. Of these, 9 were excluded due to incomplete data. The 45 ihCA remaining patients were old (mean age 75 ± 15 years) and 28 (62%) were male. Patients with a RRT activation for another cause were younger (63 ± 22 years), and 37 (41%) were male, p < 0.001. The MEWS score was elevated 24 h before ihCA patients in 67% of patients. In 14 patients (31%), there were criteria for the activation of the RRT (MEWS ≥ 4). The most common initial rhythm was assistole (91%); the median time of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempt was 18 min [10–25] , but only 7% of patients had return of spontaneous circulation. The ihCA hospital mortality was 93%. On opposite, the other RRT activations, without ihCA, had a mortality rate of only 8% (Table 1).Conclusions: During the study, period ihCA had a very high mortality rate. Early recognition of signs of clinical deterioration (using the MEWS score) and prompt activation of a RRT may help to prevent ihCA and decrease mortality.Table 1(abstract P078)Comparison between patients of ihCA and non ihCA activationihCA activationsNon ihCA activationsMale (%)6241Age (mean; standard deviation)75 ± 1563 ± 22Hospital mortality (%)938P079Contribution of simulation learning management of cardiocirculatory arrestW.

    "full_text": "to conventional training.Methods: A population of anesthesist-intensive care and emergency medicine residents; already familiar with simulation for clinical situations other than cardiocirculatory arrest at the IMS simulation center; were included in the study and divided into two groups. A group “ACC” for Cardio-Circulatory Arrest, which was specifically trained on a simulator on this topic. A control group “C” who had only theoretical training. Each of the residents was assessed on their management of critical situation: refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) at six weeks and then at 6 months from the date of initial practical training for the ACC group. The scenario was the same for all residents.Results: Twenty residents in intensive care anesthesia and 10 in emergency medicine were included with 15 residents per group (10 anesthesia-intensive care and 5 emergency medicine). The scores obtained by ACC group were significantly higher than those of the C group either at 6 weeks or at 6 months, and also for the “diagnosis” and “compliance with the algorithm” subgroups. There is no significant improvement in scores between the different assessment times for the ACC group. On the other hand, for group C there is a significant improvement in grades at 6 months (T1) compared to grades obtained at 6 weeks. The ratings of participants during the study were positive.Conclusions: This study confirms the short and medium term educational benefit of simulator training versus traditional training. The use of simulation allows knowledge retention for up to 1 year after the initial practical training phase.P080AiCR 1, artificial intelligence in cardiac arrest 1: automatized extraction tool by text mining in cardiac arrestR.

An analysis on algorithms errors showed that the main extractions errors were attributable to the complexity context and to the complexity variables (36% both). The most missing values were found in the biology variables (59.27%). The clustering results showed two group of CHR, differing for death, witness presence, multi-organ failure, status epilepticus and Glasgow scale.Conclusions: We developed a reliable extraction tool, fully automated and adaptative, able to extract hundreds of data in seconds (0.27 s for one CHR and 137.6 s for 504 CHR).

Conservative treatment was adopted in 22% of cases; 15.05% required immediate use of intravenous antihypertensive treatments.Conclusions: Preeclampsia is still common in developing countries. It remains a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Our study confirms the seriousness of persistent pre-eclampsia, which carries a high risk of maternal complications (eclampsia, acute renal failure, cytolysis, etc.) and maternal mortality, which can be reduced at the cost of a better detection and treatment policy.P082WithdrawnP083MIS-C or missed diagnosis?M. Wiggelinkhuizen, G. J. JaspersPediatric Intensive Care, RadboudUMC, Nijmegen, NetherlandsCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P083Introduction: The objective of this case description is to create awareness among pediatric intensivists about the diagnostic pitfalls regarding Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and its differential diagnosis.Methods: By means of two case descriptions, we illustrate and reflect on the pitfalls that led to both under- and overdiagnosis of MIS-C.Results: Brief patient descriptions are presented in Table 1. The 3-year-old patient was misdiagnosed for MIS-C and turned out to have a perforated appendicitis with peritonitis. The suspicion of MIS-C was based on clinical symptoms in combination with the elevated NT-pro-BNP, which is often seen in MIS-C. However, elevated cardiac biomarkers as NT-pro-BNP and Troponin-T may also be caused by non-cardiac causes, like sepsis, shock and ARDS [1]. The combination of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypotension that were present in this girl, are often presenting symptoms of patients with MIS-C. However, they are not specific and are seen in a range of other diagnoses as well. The 8-year-old girl, with the same symptoms of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypotension, was initially diagnosed for acute appendicitis, but turned out to have MIS-C with left ventricular failure. While no clear symptom or biomarker can distinguish between MIS-C and its differential diagnosis, the presence of conjunctivitis, skin rash and/or coronary dilatation on echocardiography are suggestive for MIS-C, while blood cultures can help to differentiate MIS-C from septic shock / toxic shock syndrome.Conclusions: Intensivists have to be aware of the existence of MIS-C and the pitfalls of its broad clinical and biochemical abnormalities.

One of the main ED priorities is to quickly identify those who will need hospital admission. This study evaluates the performance of a simple logistic model on its ability to predict whether a patient visiting the ED will subsequently be admitted to the hospital or not, based on initial ED patients’ data retrieved from the Biochemistry and Hematology Laboratories. Our aim is to find an algorithm using ML techniques to assist clinical decision-making in the emergency setting.Methods: A total of 3,204 ED visits were analyzed during the study period (14 March-4 May 2019).

Currently, discussions with undergraduated students about communication, including ‘SPIKES' protocol are necessary but the act of transmitting bad news must be present. The aim of this study is to investigate the perspective of students related to this subject.Methods: Anonymous online surveys were applied to 70 fifth-year medical students, containing quantitative and qualitative questions, on the 'SPIKES' protocol and describing their perception of training for difficult news communication techniques during academic training.Results: A total of 70 students completed the assessments, mean age 26.4 and 68.1% (n = 48) female. They were asked if they had practical training on the subject until their respective current periods and 77.1% (n = 54), denied having had any kind of practice, 84.3% said being not prepared to give difficult news to patients and family members, although the vast majority of participants demonstrated empathy during communication processes. At last we found that only a little more than half of the students had theoretical contact with protocols and preparation to give difficult news, and that most did not receive any practical training for such a scenario.Conclusions: The medical students could gain competencies in breaking bad news using a practical approach, valued theoretical and practical ones. The implementation in teaching of these skills in medical schools is essential for greater safety of the professional in their daily practice and for the best care of patients and their relatives.P088Monocyte distribution width* in patients with COVID-19: indicator of disease severityS.

Patients were categorized into 2 groups: Group-1 (n = 122) - including asymptomatic patients and those with mild and moderate disease and Group 2 - including patients (n = 23) with severe disease. The performance of MDW was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Additional analysis was conducted for outcome, comparing COVID-19 patients who were discharged (n = 135) vs COVID-19 deceased patients (n = 10).Results: MDW as a marker of disease severity demonstrated in ROC analysis AUC of 0.702 (95% CI 0.620–0.775).

KlinePMR, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USACritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P091Introduction: This study investigates the combined effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hypertension in rats on motor coordination, spatial learning, sustained attention, and anxiety. The hypothesis is that hypertension will worsen TBI-induced deficiencies. Hypertension afflicts nearly half of American adults, thus it is critical to investigate TBI models that take this pre-existing condition into account.Methods: A pathophysiological study was conducted on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Rats were assigned to receive a controlled cortical impact (CCI; 2.8 mm cortical deformation depth, 4 m/s) or a sham injury. Both sham and TBI rats underwent the Beam Walking Task (motor) as well as the Morris Water Maze (MWM; spatial learning). Open field testing (OFT) was performed to examine anxiety, while Shock Probe Defensive Burying Task (SPDB) inspected passive/active coping behavior. 3-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (3-CSRT) was used in a separate cohort of SHR rats to examine sustained attention and distractibility.Results: Adult male SHR TBI rats have on average 10% higher heart rate and 30% higher mean arterial pressure versus injured WKY rats. Injured SHR rats demonstrated impaired motor skills as well as diminished spatial learning compared to sham rats. SHR TBI rats also spent less time actively burying the shock probe, and displayed reduced percent accuracy and increased omissions during 3-CSRT, suggesting impaired sustained attention. Results"

Current guidelines advocate early endotracheal intubation (ETI) in patients with suspected severe TBI. Although potentially beneficial, prehospital ETI is associated with a high rate of complications. The ability to accurately diagnose TBI in the field is limited. We investigated the prevalence of clinically significant TBI among patients intubated in the field due to presumed severe TBI.Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from EMS and hospital records of trauma patients for whom ETI was attempted on the scene (either successfully or not) and who were transferred to Rambam Health Care Campus, Israel between 2014 and 2020. The indication for ETI was extracted. The primary outcome was clinically significant head trauma (a significant lesion on head CT, need for neurosurgery, or abnormal neurologic examination after extubation) among patients intubated due to suspected severe TBI. We excluded patients intubated due to non-traumatic conditions, burns, during CPR, facial trauma compromising airway, hypoxemia, and severe shock.Results: A total of 349 patients were included in the final analysis (Fig. 1) - 95.7% suffered blunt trauma, 82.8% were male, and the median age was 34 years (IQR 23–57).

This population may be exposed to the risks and complications of prehospital ETI without any potential benefits. Patients with a higher field GCS and those suffering from intoxication have a higher risk of misdiagnosis and potentially unnecessary ETI.Fig. 1(abstract P092)Study flow chartP093Intracranial compliance does not ameliorate with decompressive craniectomyS. Brasil, D. S. SollaNeurology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P093Introduction: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) has demonstrated to be effective for intracranial pressure (ICP) control, although not relevant results have been observed concerning mortality reduction in TBI. One hypothesis for this outcome is that DC does not return intracranial compliance (ICC) for its previous state, before acute injury. The present study aimed to assess the morphological alterations in intracranial pressure pulse waveform (ICPPW) among neurocritical care patients with and without DC, by comparing the variations of ICPPW according to elevations in ICP by two techniques.Methods: Patients requiring ICP monitoring because of severe traumatic or spontaneous conditions were included. ICP mean values were compared with ICPPW features (P2/P1 ratio, time-to-peak [TTP]) obtained from ICP invasive catheters and a new technology that captures beat-by-beat skull pulsations (B4C). Elevation of ICP was produced by means of ultrasound-guided internal jugular veins compression. Analysis of ICPPW features were compared between techniques and distributed for three groups: intact skull (exclusive burr hole for ICP monitoring), craniotomy/large fractures (group 2) or DC (group 3).Results: 57 patients were analyzed, 32 with both techniques. 21 (36%) presented no skull defects, whereas 15 (26%) had DC. ICP was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.56). Significant elevation was observed for P2/P1 ratio for groups 1 and 2, whereas reduction was observed in group 3 (elevation of ± 0.09 for groups 1 and 2, whereas reduction of 0.03 for group 3, p = 0.01). B4C disclosed strong correlation with invasive ICPPW features (AUC 0.86 for P2/P1 ratio, 0.81 for TTP).Conclusions: Intracranial compliance was significantly more impaired among decompressive craniectomy patients, although this technique seems to be protective for further influences of ICP elevations over the brain. Correlation between techniques was significant, indicating the B4C system as promising to monitor intracranial compliance noninvasively.P094Apoptosis activation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) corresponded with severity of brain injury-preliminary studyD.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected at admission, for third and seventh day after incident. Activation of intrinistic, extrinistic and endoplasmic reticulum pathways were measured.Results: Results showed significantly increased levels of selected apoptotic factors concentration after 72 h and on the 7thday after incident. We found a significant correlation between apoptotic factors, GCS and 28-day mortality. There were no statistically significant correlations between apoptosis and EVLWI and PVPI.Conclusions: Activation and imbalance of apoptotic pathways seems to be an important process in lungs after severe brain trauma.

One approach to address heterogeneity might be to resolve undifferentiated populations into subphenotypes which would have greater intrinsic biological uniformity. We hypothesized that clinically meaningful subphenotypes can be identified using unsupervised computational approaches applied to electronic health records and physiological time series (PTS) data.Methods: Adult patients admitted to the ICU for management of TBI were selected from a multi-center database (eICU), and clinical, laboratory and physiological time series data were extracted. Unsupervised clustering algorithms were implemented accounting for mixed data types. Clusters were characterized according to outcome distributions at discharge, and differences in physiology. The clustering algorithm was validated externally on an analogous TBI population in an independent, single-center dataset (MIMIC-III).Results: Among 4,450 patients admitted to intensive care with TBI, we identified four clusters (a, b, c, d) each with a distinct outcome probability distribution, and each"

The aim of this study was to identify data signatures in TBI patients recorded in the first 24 h of ICU admission. We tested the hypothesis that these signatures are associated with short term clinical outcomes.Methods: A total of 4,450 patients admitted to the ICU for management of TBI were selected from the multisite clinical database (eICU) and clinical, laboratory and physiological time series data were extracted. Outcomes were mortality and neurological outcome at discharge. The eICU developed machine learning algorithms were externally validated on an analogous TBI sample in an independent single-center ICU database (MIMIC-III). Model performance metrics were compared with reference International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) and Corticoid Randomization After Significant Head injury (CRASH) logistic regression models.Results: The computational models performed well for both neurological outcome prediction and mortality prediction, with test metrics that compared favorably with reference IMPACT and CRASH scores (Fig. 1). External validation utilizing MIMIC III corroborated the results from eICU for both neurological outcome and mortality suggesting robust generalizability. Top predictive features included age, PTS derived variables, glucose, platelet count, white blood cell count, and Glasgow Coma subscores, all originating from the first 24 h of ICU admission.Conclusions: Results indicate that computational models trained with data available in the first 24 h after admission are predictive of short-term"

Intensity of these interventions can be quantified using the TIL scale, a reliable measurement with a high degree of validity for assessing ICP management in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) [2]. Studies showed significant center variation in TIL treatments for patients with TBI, possibly reflecting aggressive use or inappropriate escalation strategies [3].Methods: We developed a user-friendly TIL scale calculator to improve ICP management. Based on the intuitively started ICP management, current ICP and desired target ICP, a TIL-coefficient will be calculated, which will numerically and visually reflect whether past and current treatment is appropriate, inadequate or overly aggressive. Additionally, a TIL scale-based algorithm can optimize ICP management. Hereby, inappropriate escalation or de-escalation could be avoided. The indication, relevance and ease of use of the TIL scale calculator was peer reviewed in three Belgian hospitals.Results: The TIL scale calculator, with both TIL-coefficient and TIL scale algorithm, resulted in more awareness regarding ICP management. The numerical and visual feedback of past and current ICP management and possible treatment modalities was an advantageous tool, leading to more evidence-based decision making. However, suggestions from the TIL scale based algorithm should always be critically assessed prior to implementation in daily clinical practice.Conclusions: This user-friendly TIL scale calculator is based on the TIL scale, which has been proven to be reliable and valid. Implementing this tool in daily clinical practice can lead to more specific and targeted ICP management. To assess reliability and validity of ICP management based on the TIL scale calculator, further studies are warranted.ReferencesBattaglini D et al. Front Neurol 11:602,114, 2020Zuercher P et al.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) HTR1A C(-1019)G (rs6295) site is located in promoter area and affects HTR1A gene transcription [1]. Allele G associates with depression, post-traumatic mental disorders, and resistance to antipsychotic drugs [1]. Altered expression of the HTR1A gene associates with increased oxidation due to a deficient anti-oxidation mechanism [3]. Our study aimed to investigate whether the HTR1A SNP links to neurological impairment and circulating oxidized DNA (oxDNA) in patients re-admitted to a neuro ICU.Methods: Study cohort included 240 neuro ICU patients (median age 54 years, range 18–88 years) with consequences of trauma, anoxic brain injury, stroke, brain tumor. HTR1A rs6295 polymorphism was studied using an HTR1A specific oligonucleotide tetra primer set, PCR, and gel electrophoresis. Oxidized DNA (oxDNA) concentration in plasma was determined with antibodies to 8-oxo-2’-deoxyguanosine and membrane immunoassay.Results: On day 1, NIHSS scores (but not Glasgow or SOFA scales) revealed differences between patients with CC genotype vs. G carriers: medians 8 (6.5;12.5) vs. 13 (9.2;18.0), respectively (p = 0.012, Mann–Whitney) (Fig. 1). Increased oxDNA values were associated with CC genotypes: odds ratio (OR) 2.213, 95%CI%: 1.201–4.077, p = 0.016 (Fisher test), n = 240. This association was significant only in a cohort of patients with no pneumonia (OR 2.991, 95%CI%: 1.170–7.645, p = 0.036, n = 92).Conclusions: The results link enhanced neurologic impairment and decreased oxDNA in circulation in the cohort of carriers of HTR1A G resistant to a lung infection that may stem from the dual effect of the mutant gene in neural and immune cells.ReferencesSoga T et al.

Intracellular and metabolic changes indicate that, despite the deep-seated process, changes are usually reversible and the regenerative potential of muscle fibers is preserved. Analysis of 18F-FDG metabolism of the shoulder girdle muscles in patients with CHF showed its decrease regardless of the side of paresis.Conclusions: A clear correlation of the metabolism level and changes in muscle tone, deep reflexes was not found, but a certain priority was found in the skeletal muscles innervated by the dominant hemisphere.Acknowledgement: Supported by RFBR grant 19–29-01,066.P100Machine learning and heart rate variability to detect cerebral ischemiaR.

The lack of precise monitoring in these patients plays a major role in the delayed identification of DCI. The main objective of this study is to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) data from SAH patients for further analysis, using machine-learning to aid us in identifying imminent DCI. We hypothesize that machine learning, may detect incipient DCI using HRV trends.Methods: HRV data from a previous study underwent comprehensive analysis. The HRV material was collected prospectively from a cohort of 64 patients with aSAH admitted to the neurointensive care unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, 2015–2016. HRV data was cleaned from noise, quantified and labelled in multiple steps and analyzed using the Random Forest supervised machine learning algorithm.Results: HRV data was obtained in 55 patients. After excluding 19 patients due to low quality data, a total of 36 patients remained, 12 of which developed DCI. The machine learning algorithm was able to identify 71% of patients with DCI. Nevertheless, DCI was also detected in non-DCI patients, demonstrating a specificity of 57%Conclusions: This study implies that processing of HRV, using machine learning can be helpful in patients susceptible to DCI. The results display an adequate sensitivity; however, the specificity was low. Our data support further investigation, correlating HRV and cerebral ischemia.

The data points were then labelled with the event name. The feature matrix was used to train a random forest algorithm.Results: Nine patients were included in a pilot study. Recognition of the clinical events was achieved with an accuracy of 82–98%, precision (specificity) 86–98%, and recall (sensitivity) 87–98%. Accuracy was not affected when NIRS-values were excluded from analysis. Using decision tree or support vector machine algorithms yielded similar results.Conclusions: It is possible for a ML-algorithm to differ between clinical events, including clamping of the carotid arteries, in a controlled environment.

Previous studies that examined the relation between electrocardiographic and echocardiographic (echo) changes in SAH patients and patient outcomes were conflicting [1, 2].Methods: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, data was collected from ICU patients with an aneurysmal SAH between 01/06/2017 and 31/12/2020. We reviewed electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission and defined an abnormal ECG as either a significant ST-elevation or depression, a significant T-wave inversion or an abnormal QTc (> 440 ms for men, > 460 ms for women). We collected echo findings (left ventricular ejection fraction, EF) when available. Univariate regression analysis or Chi-square testing was used wherever applicable.Results: A total of 150 SAH patients were identified (patient characteristics in Table 1). 74 patients had a normal ECG (group 1), in 71 patients ECG changes were found (group 2), 5 patients had no ECG on admission and were excluded. A prolonged QTc was found in 66%, ST-T changes in 12%, both in 21%. A total of 7 patients received an echo in group 1 (9%) compared to 18 in group 2 (25%).

The model of Long's focal ischemia was used as a basis. The animals were split into 5 groups: false-operated, control (model of ischemic stroke with the introduction of 0.9% NaCl) and three groups in which the simulation of ischemic stroke was combined with the introduction of lithium chloride in various concentrations (4.2 mg/kg, 21 mg/kg and 63 mg/kg, respectively). The drug was administered daily for 14 days. Daily, cumulative, and final mortality rates were evaluated.Results: According to the results of the experiment, the following data on mortality were obtained: false – operated rats – 0 out of 8, control group – 13 out of 22 (lethality 59%), group III (LiCl 4.2 mg/kg) – 8 out of 14 (lethality 57%), p > 0.05 relative to the control, group IV (LiCl 21 mg/kg) - 6 out of 15 (lethality 40%) p > 0.05 relative to the control and in group V (LiCl 63 mg/kg), 4 out of 15 animals died (lethality 27%) p = 0.0317 relative to the control. The highest mortality rate in the control group was observed on day 1 (22.7%). In groups IV and V, the daily mortality rate was evenly distributed, in group III the largest number of animals died on day 3 (3 out of 14; 21.42%). The cumulative mortality rate in group III significantly differed from the control one only on day 2 (p < 0.05). In group IV, cumulative mortality was significantly lower up to 7 days (p < 0.05). In group V, cumulative mortality was significantly lower (p < 0.05) until 14 days after euthanasia.Conclusions: Long-term administration of"

The long focal ischemia model was used. The animals were split into five groups: false-operated (median incision in the projection of the carotid artery without ischemia), control (model of ischemic stroke with the introduction of 0.9% NaCl) and three groups with the introduction of lithium chloride at concentrations of 4.2 mg/kg, 21 mg/kg and 63 mg/kg, respectively. Lithium chloride was administered immediately after the termination of the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and then every 24 h until euthanasia. To assess the degree of brain damage, the animals underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 2, and brain sections stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride were evaluated on day 7 after euthanasia.Results: According to MRI data, lithium chloride at a dose of 4.2 mg/kg did not significantly affect the volume of ischemic stroke and perifocal edema in relation to the control group on day 2 (p = 0.9). When using a dose of 21 mg/kg, the volume of stroke (p = 0.04) and perifocal edema was significantly lower (p = 0.03) than in the control group (by 25% and 18%, respectively). Lithium chloride at a dose of 63 mg/kg significantly reduced the volume of stroke (45%, p = 0.004) and perifocal edema (35%, p = 0.007). When determining the volume of the lesion on day 7, the data were comparable with the results obtained on day 2. When using a dose of 21 mg/kg, the stroke volume was 20% lower (p = 0.04) than in the control group. Lithium chloride at a dose of 63 mg/kg reduced stroke volume by 40% (p = 0.0037).Conclusions: Lithium chloride at dosages of 21 mg/kg and 63 mg/kg significantly reduced the volume of ischemic stroke and perifocal edema of the brain, but when using a concentration of 63 mg/kg, the effect was more pronounced.P105Influence of patient characteristics on quality indicators of stroke treatment: a retrospective single center analysis over four yearsA.

Important target times to improve patient outcome are door-to-CT time, door-to-needle time (DNT) and door-to-groin time (DGT). Since 2017 stroke data was prospectively collected in the framework of stroke center accreditation in ZOL Genk, Belgium. We hypothesized that this would improve target times and enlarge the proportion of treated patients.Methods: All patients admitted for stroke or TIA at ZOL stroke center, Genk, Belgium, between 2017 and 2020 were included. Quality indicators were proportion of treated patients, door-to-CT time, DNT and DGT. A structured data collection and a stroke working flow template were created to enhance and harmonize stroke diagnostics and treatment in 2019. As of 2020, intravenous thrombolysis was administered immediately at the CT scan.Results: In total 1255 patients were included. The number of patients registered with stroke and TIA increased by 80% over 4 years (p < 0.0001). Median age differed over time: 78 years in 2017 vs. 74 years in 2020 (p = 0.03). NIHSS at admission decreased over the last two years (p < 0.0001). In addition, onset-to-door time, door-to-CT time and DNT were different (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0005, p < 0.0001). DGT was similar between consecutive years (p = 0.54). The proportion of conservatively treated patients increased over time by 15% (p = 0.0001) (Table 1).Conclusions: Patients were younger and presented with milder strokes in comparison with earlier years. Increased detection of stroke patients was probably due to underreporting of milder strokes in the past. The higher proportion of conservatively treated patients hereby may have affected target times such as a prolonged door-to-CT time. The sudden drop of DNT in 2020 can be explained by administration of thrombolysis already at the CT scan. Increased awareness and training among staff probably led to increased diagnoses of acute cerebrovascular accidents in our stroke center and may help to further reduce target times.Table 1(abstract P105)Patient demographics and treatment per year2017 (n = 241)2018 (n = 274)2019 (n = 305)2020 (n = 435)p valueAge, years, median (IQR)78 (68 – 84)74 (63 – 83)76 (66 – 83)74 (64 – 82)0.03NIHSS, median (IQR) (n)6 (3 – 15) (227)6 (3 – 14) (269)3 (1 – 10) (305)3 (1 – 7) (434)< 0.0001Onset to door time, hours, median (IQR) (n)1.87 (0.89 – 3.66) (164)1.62 (0.94 – 3.79) (185)2.93 (1.13 – 9.82) (270)7.55 (1.63 – 19.16) (422)< 0.0001Door to CT time, minutes, median (IQR) (n)27 (16 – 52) (235)34 (20 – 71) (250)39 (22 – 63) (289)37 (21 – 68) (371)0.0005Door to"

Huet21Departement of Anaesthesia and Surgical Intensive Care, CHRU Brest, Brest, France;2CHRU Brest, Brest, FranceCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P106Introduction: An increasing number of acute stroke patients are being admitted to an ICU. Those patients have high hospital mortality and poor functional outcomes [1]. However, limited data regarding the impact of organ support therapies are available. Moreover little is known about the use and the impact of withholding life sustaining treatment (LST).Methods: We used the Brest Stroke Registry, a population-based prospective registry (INSERM) to identify all stroke patients (ischemic and hemorrhagic) admitted to an ICU in between 2008 and 2017 with at least one organ support therapy. This registry regroups all confirmed cases of stroke over the region of Brest city [2]. We retrospectively collected specific data from ICU stay. ICU mortality, 90-days mortality and functional status at hospital discharge were analyzed.Results: A total of 215 patients were included, 61.4% were men, mean age was 65.66 ± 12.39 years. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 109/215 (50.1%); hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 106/215 (49.3%). Mean NIHSS score at admission was 22.53 ± 14.74, and mean GCS score was 9.39 ± 4.78. 112/215 (52%) patients died during ICU stay, 120/199 (60%) patients died before 90-days. A total of 158 out of 178 (88%) had poor outcomes (modified Rankin Score 4–6) at hospital discharge. Seventy-nine (36.9%) patients had care limitations. Age, mechanical ventilation at admission, and intracranial hypertension were independently associated with hospital mortality and 90-day mortality. Need of vasopressors was associated with hospital mortality. NIHSS score at admission and mechanical ventilation were independent predictors of poor functional outcome. Adjusting on decision to withhold LST did not modify these associations.Conclusions: Our study showed that survival and functional outcomes remain poor in stroke patients admitted in ICU. Both neurological severity and organ support therapy were independent predictors of poor outcomes.Referencesde Montmollin E et al. Ann Intensive Care 10:53, 2020Timsit S et al.

Predicting the onset of cerebral vasospasm remains a challenge. Recent research suggests an association between vasospasm and arterial hypertension, thus rendering changes in blood pressure (BP) a candidate for predicting increased risk of cerebral vasospasm. We investigated for a correlation between arterial hypertension following SAH and the onset of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm.Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of coiled aneurysmal SAH patients between January 2017 and June 2020 in Cork University Hospital. Post-coiling 4-hourly BP readings were collected up to day 9 or discharge. Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm was defined as a focal neurologic deficit or decrease of > 1 point on the Glasgow Coma Scale lasting > 1 h, non-attributable to other causes. Logistic regression analysis was performed for all the BP readings with adjustment for age, sex, presence of hydrocephalus and history of hypertension.Results: A total of 56 patients were included in the analysis, 21 developed vasospasm (37.5%). Mean day of vasospasm onset was day 6 (± 2) post-coiling. A 10 mmHg increase in systolic BP was associated with an increased risk of cerebral vasospasm [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–2.6; p value < 0.05] (Fig. 1). The association was stronger in patients with pre-existing hypertension [OR = 2.29; 95% CI 1.1–4.77; p value < 0.05]. Cubic spline analysis showed a positive linear relationship between systolic BP and predicting the risk of vasospasm. No significance was found in diastolic or mean arterial pressure.Conclusions: An increase in systolic BP post-coiling for SAH correlated with increased risk for cerebral vasospasm. Systolic BP may be of use in anticipating patients at increased risk for vasospasm, thereby prompting closer monitoring and earlier therapeutic intervention.Fig. 1(abstract P107)aSystolic blood pressure readings across study period in vasospasm (red) versus non-vasospasm (blue) patients with line shading representing 95% confidence interval.

Burdenko, Moscow, Russian FederationCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P108Introduction: Several phenyl-containing acids which are metabolites of tyrosine and phenylalanine have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neurosurgical patients with various intracranial diseases or injuries [1]. The goal of this study was to determine if the content of one of these acids (4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, p-HPhLA) was specific for the neurosurgical patients with the suspected bacterial meningitis.Methods: The residues of CSF samples from neurosurgical patients (n = 84) were obtained after diagnostic lumbar puncture, including patients with the suspected bacterial meningitis (n = 9). Concentration of p-HPhLA was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry [1]. Nonparametric the Mann–Whitney U-test and ROC analysis with the AUROC parameter (area under the ROC curve) was used.Results: The median values (interquartile range 25–75%) of the p-HPhLA for the patients without and with the suspected bacterial meningitis were 0.5 [0.3–1.1] and 1.1 [0.7–1.9] µmol/l, respectively. The concentration of the p-HPhLA was statistically higher in patients with the suspected bacterial meningitis (p = 0.025). The results of ROC analysis: AUROC – 0.730; standard error – 0.085, p = 0.025, two-sided asymptotic confidence interval (95%) – 0.563–0.898. The cut-off value was 0.7 µmol/l. Sensitivity – 77.8% (95% CI: 44.3%; 94.7%), specificity – 62.7% (95% CI: 51.3%; 72.8%). The patients with the concentration of the p-HPhLA equal or higher than 0.7 µmol/l had 5 times higher risk of the developing meningitis (unadjusted RR: 4.900 [95% CI: 1.082; 22.191]).Conclusions: The results of statistical analysis indicate that the concentration of the p-HPhLA can be a one-parameter criterion for the diagnosis of the bacterial meningitis in neurosurgical patients.Acknowledgements: Supported by the grant of President of the Russian Federation [No. MK-627.2020.7].ReferencePautova A et al.

    "full_text": "retrospectively 297 consecutive non-traumatic SAH patients admitted to the ICU in a tertiary academic medical center, we aimed to identify factors associated with prolonged MV and to create a predictive score for prolonged MV.Methods: Using multivariable generalized linear models, we identified factors associated with MV > 48 h, > 7 days, and > 14 days. Patients who were mechanically ventilated but died before 48 h, 7 days or 14 days and those never ventilated were excluded from the analysis. We incorporated those factors into a new prognostic score (the RAISE score: pRolonged ventilAtion In Subarachnoid hEmorrhage patients) to predict prolonged MV > 7 days. The score was developed by arbitrarily choosing 60% SAH patients in a training dataset which was further internally validated.Results: The median age of patients was 57 (IQR 47–68) years and median admission Hunt&Hess grade (H&H) was 3 (IQR 1–5). The median duration of MV was 9 (IQR 2–20) days in 242 (82%) patients who required MV. Associations were found between a higher Acute Physiology Score (APS) and MV > 48 h, > 7 days and > 14 days, as well as between a higher H&H and MV > 7 days and > 14 days. Early neuroimaging findings (hydrocephalus; high-grade SEBES, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Early Brain Edema Score) were associated with MV > 48 h. High-grade SEBES and co-occurrence of intraparenchymal bleeding were associated with MV > 7 days. Neuroimaging was, however, not associated with MV > 14 days. The RAISE score included age, APS, H&H, SEBES, and the presence of ICH stratifying the risk of MV > 7 days (See Fig. 1).Conclusions: Disease severity and neuroimaging findings detected within 24 h of ICU admission are associated with the need for prolonged MV in patients with SAH.

Fluid management was guided by the transpulmonary thermodilution system and aimed at euvolemia (cardiac index, CI ≥ 3.0 l/min/m2; global end-diastolic index, GEDI 680–800 ml/m2; stroke volume variation, SVV < 10%). Patients were managed using a PbtO2targeted protocol to prevent brain tissue hypoxia (BTH, PbtO2< 20 mmHg). To assess the association between CI and PbtO2and the effect of fluid challenges on CI and PbtO2we used generalized estimating equations.Results: On a total of 60 included patients (median age 56 [IQRs 47–65] years), BTH occurred in 23% of the monitoring time during the first 10 days since admission. Overall, mean CI was within normal ranges (ranging from 3.1 ± 1.3 l/min/m2on day 0 to 4.1 ± 1.1 l/min/m2on day 4). Higher CI values were associated with higher PbtO2levels (Wald = 14.2; p < 0.001). Neither daily fluid input nor fluid balance were associated with absolute PbtO2levels (p = 0.94 and p = 0.85, resp.) or the occurrence of BTH (p = 0.68 and p = 0.71, resp). PbtO2levels were similar during hypovolemia and euvolemia. PbtO2increased as a response to fluid boluses only if BTH was present at baseline (from 13 ± 6 to 16 ± 11 mmHg, adjusted OR = 15.2 [95% CI 2.3–99.6]; p = 0.005), but not in all interventions (p = 0.89).Conclusions: In this study, a moderate association between increased cardiac output and brain oxygenation was observed. Fluid challenges may improve PbtO2only in the presence of BTH at baseline. Individualized hemodynamic management requires advanced cardiac and brain monitoring in critically ill SAH patients.Fig. 1(abstract P110)(A) PbtO2did not change (p = 0.89) as a response to fluid boluses both in CI responders and non-responders (p = 0.92, p = 1.00).

After six to eight months, included patients were asked to join additional cognitive examination, consisting of the Trail Making Test A and B, Letter Digit Substitution Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Cognitive test results were compared to available normative data, adjusted for age and level of education.Results: We included 123 patients with COVID-19 for plasma sampling and performed follow-up cognitive testing in 48 patients.

It is especially likely to happen in patients who suffer spasticity in the upper limbs. Managing spasticity could positively impact neurological status. A regional blockade of the upper limb causes anesthesia and muscular relaxation in relevant zones. That potentially can be beneficial during spasticity treatment, especially physical therapy, which can cause pain and increasing of muscular hypertonicity itself.Methods: Four patients with chronic DOC after local ethics committee approval received treatment of spasticity added by continuous brachial plexus block combined with the upper limb periodical immobilization via plaster splint in as far as possible extended position. All the patients had been assessed initially, then during treatment and at the discharge with Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Nociception Coma Scale-Revised (NCS-R), as well as passive range of movements in elbow joints were measured.Results: There was among all the patients increased passive range of movements in elbow joints (10-40o), decreased intensity of spasticity (2 MAS comparing with 3–4 before treatment), nobody had pain level above 1 NCSR during physical therapy (initially they had 3–4).

The average duration of DOC - 4.4 ± 0.7 months. The 1 group - patients with a total score CRS-R of 0–5 points, 2 group of 5–8, and 3 group - > 9. All patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) for 2 days, melatonin level was measured 6 times a day: at 8 am, 15 pm, 18 pm, 21 pm, 24 pm and 3 am, daily urine collection to determine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the daily and night portions of urine. MRI (3 Tesla) with a detailed assessment of structural changes in the brainstem, hypothalamus and thalamus according to the \"MRI atlas of the human hypothalamus\" by M. Baroncini. Also, PSG data were compared with PET CT of the brain.Results: 41.7% of patients of group 1, there were no sleep cycles. The NREM/REM ratio in patients of the 1 group was almost twice as high as in patients of the 2 and 3 groups. In patients of 3 group total sleep time was higher, and sleep cycles were recorded in 58.3% of patients, the average value of the N2/total sleep time ratio was higher, but the average value of the N1/total sleep time ratio in patients of the third group was lower than in other groups. Melatonin level was maintained in patients of all groups. Relationship of PSG changes in the FDG PET data was not found. When analyzing macroscopic changes of the structure morphology (thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, corpus callosum), relationship with the assignment to the group and the PSG data was not identified.Conclusions: There are no clearly defined PSG patterns that reliably define each of the reviewed DOC states.

Stevens21Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA;2Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, USACritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P116Introduction: Patients with acute brain injury (ABI) commonly receive mechanical ventilation (MV) which can be harmful due to lung injury and adverse physiological effects on the brain. Our aim was to explore relationships between MV and outcome of patients with ABI. We hypothesize that MV variables are important determinants of short-term ABI outcomes.Methods: Adult patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke who received MV as part of their care in the ICU were selected from large multicenter database (eICU). A set of features was crafted based on current recommendations for lung-protective MV and included time “out-of-range” (OOR) for: tidal volume per ideal body weight (> 8 ml/kg), plateau pressure (> 30 cmH2O), PEEP (< 5 cmH2O). Outcomes were defined as “Unfavorable” for patients who died or whose discharge motor Glasgow Coma Score (mGCS) was < 5, and “Favorable” for patients who were alive and had a mGCS ≥ 5 at discharge. Two models were created: (1) A clinical model which uses only the first value recorded for each feature; and (2) A combined model which included predefined OOR MV variables.Results: Data were analyzed on 839 and 1,221 ICU stays for TBI and stroke, respectively. Clinical and combined models had an AUROC of 0.67 ± 0.07 and 0.79 ± 0.13 for Stroke and an AUROC of 0.70 ± 0.07 and 0.81 ± 0.07 respectively for TBI. A number of OOR MV variables and respiratory physiologic variables were found to be significant (Fig. 1). Longer durations of exposure to OOR tidal volume, PEEP and plateau pressure were identified as top contributors with longer OOR durations predictive of unfavorable outcome.Conclusions: These results indicate that exposure to non-lung protective MV may contribute to clinical and neurological outcomes in stroke and TBI patients. They support the need for clinical trials evaluating optimal MV strategies in this population.Fig. 1(abstract P116)Feature ranking of top 50 features for TBI combined model (left) and stoke combined model (right).

Placement of an intracerebral catheter represents the gold standard technique for intracranial pressure (ICP) invasive monitoring. This maneuver has usually been performed by neurosurgeons, but recently this procedure has more often been carried out by intensivists, at the bedside [2]. Preliminary retrospective data suggest that ICP catheter placement performed by trained intensivists can be a safe procedure which can be carried out faster than the one performed by neurosurgeons, with a similar incidence of complications. The aim of this observational, prospective and multicentric study is to compare timing of invasive ICP monitoring performed by intensivist and neurosurgeons and to detect differences in the incidence of complications.Methods: We are including all adults with acute cerebral pathology and urgent indication to invasive ICP monitoring in 16 different centers in Italy. Exclusion criteria are represented by significative coagulation disorders, not urgent request, need for intracranial catheter placement other than ICP monitoring. Timing of ICP probe positioning will be analyzed as follows: T0 represents time in which ICH development is suspected, T1 represents time when indication to ICP monitoring is stated and T2 is the time in which skin incision is performed. Incidence of catheter-related intracranial bleedings, meningitis related to procedure and wrong positioning of catheter and/or its malfunction will be also registered.Results: This study was registered on ClinicalTrial.gov. Centers are enrolling patients.Conclusions: Despite all efforts, intracranial hypertension is still a worldwide medical issue. TIMING-ICP may allow us to assess if ICP monitoring placement by intensivists can be a time-saving procedure compared to neurosurgical one and equally safe.ReferencesVik A et al.

We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, All EBM Reviews (Cochrane) and Embase until May 2021. Trial eligibility, data extraction and Risk of Bias (ROB Cochrane Collaboration tool) assessment were independently done by 2 or 3 reviewers.Results: Thirty-nine trials were retained after screening 16,132 papers. ROB was high in all studies, but one. Many studies evaluated multiple interventions, of which most done in adults. All 7 adult studies evaluating small blood tubes observed a significant reduction in blood loss, only 1 observed a positive effect on hemoglobin (Hb) / transfusion. 8 adult studies evaluated closed blood sampling: all showed a significant reduction in blood discarded with varying effects on Hb. 1 neonatal study showed that returning blood discarded was effective in lowering transfusion volume. Point-of-care testing was found effective in reducing transfusion in 1 adult study; 5 neonatal studies reported divergent effects. Another study showed adults being significantly sampled more with arterial line vs. without. The remaining 16 trials that implemented bundled interventions showed mixed results: only 3/10 adult studies observed a significant lower transfusion rate, the 6 pediatric trials observed a lower transfusion rate when bundles included education/protocols.Conclusions: Current evidence on interventions to reduce diagnostic blood volume and associated complications is highly heterogeneous. Using smaller tubes and closed-loop sampling may be effective in adults, while bundled interventions with protocols/teaching seem promising in the pediatric population.P119Application of population pharmacokinetics of nadroparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients: accurate prediction of anti-Xa levels and assessment of dosing regimensL.

At ICU admission, patients started with b.i.d. 5700 IU nadroparin. Using anti-Xa level vs. time, a population PK model was constructed with NONMEM v7.4.1. Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 patients) provided individual anti-Xa versus time curves to allow evaluation of the accuracy of sample timing with Bayesian analysis. Accuracy was described by the relative mean prediction error (rMPE) for bias (< 15%) and relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) for imprecision (< 25%).Results: Anti-Xa levels versus time profiles were adequately described using a 2-compartment model with following covariates associated to clearance (CL): CRP, D-dimer, CKD-EPI-eGFR, corticosteroid and vasopressor use. Target level (0.3 IU - 0.7 IU/ml) achievement was most optimal for b.i.d. 5700 IU (Fig. 1). Using 1 sample, t = 3 h allowed to estimate the anti-Xa level (rMPE: 1.8%; rRMSE: 19.1%) and CL of nadroparin (rMPE: 1.9%; rRMSE: 22.4%) most optimally. Using 2 samples, a first t = 4 h and second after a subsequent dose between t = 2 h to t = 10 h allowed to adequately predict anti-Xa levels (range rMPE: 0.94%-3.36%; rRMSE: 15.1%-23.7%) and CL (range rMPE: 0.79%-1.49%; rRMSE: 16.6%-18.2%), respectively.Conclusions: Anti-Xa levels were most optimal within target using an intermediate dose (b.i.d. 5700 IU).

Previously, we showed that PhPA is always present in blood of healthy humans, but is absent in patients with sepsis. The aim of the work is to evaluate the ability of the modified sorbent to perform targeted sorption of metabolites associated with sepsis and desorption of the modifier.Methods: In an experiment in vitro, created model solutions in blood plasma with sepsis-associated metabolites such as 3-phenyllactic (PhLA), 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic (p-HPhAA), 3- (4-hydroxyphenyl)lactic (p-HPhLA) acids close to the known concentration of these metabolites in the blood serum of patients with A) renal failure, B) sepsis, C) septic shock (Table 1).

CFDC is an iron-chelator, siderophore cephalosporin developed for the treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR) Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacterales and non-fermenter species, in adult patients with limited treatment options.Methods: Patients with serious CR infections were randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous CFDC, 2 g, q8h, or best available therapy (BAT; ≤ 3 antibiotics with Gram-negative activity) for 7–14 days [1].

CFDC is the first siderophore, iron-chelator cephalosporin developed for the treatment of adult patients with serious CR Gram-negative infections with limited treatment options. Critically ill patients with anemia eventually receive iron supplementation or blood transfusions.Methods: CREDIBLE-CR, an open-label randomized 2:1, Phase 3 study, investigated the efficacy of CFDC 2 g (or renal function-adjusted dose), q8h, or best available therapy (BAT; ≤ 3 non-siderophore antibiotics) for 7–14 days in hospitalised critically ill patients with serious CR infections [1]. Clinical cure and microbiological eradication were evaluated at end of treatment (EOT), test of cure (TOC) and follow-up (FU). Day 28 all-cause mortality (ACM) was compared for patients with or without iron supplementation given at any time up to EOT.Results: Of 118 patients with confirmed CR pathogens at baseline, 42.5% (34/80) in the CFDC arm and 36.8% (14/38) in the BAT arm received blood transfusions and/or iron preparations up to EOT.

Microcirculatory dysfunction has been proposed to cause sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI). However, whether it induces S-AKI through tissue hypoperfusion or increased local inflammation remains unclear. We hypothesize that microcirculatory dysfunction can induce S-AKI in the absence of impaired renal cortical oxygenation.Methods: C57Bl/6 mice (n = 5–8/group) were randomly assigned to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis or sham surgery. We measured the following outcomes at 24 h: renal injury using serum creatinine (sCr), systemic inflammation using IL-6, renal cortical oxygenation and mortality. Renal cortical oxygenation was measured by the phosphorescence quenching method using an established phosphorescent probe, Oxyphor PdG4, injected systemically, and an OxyLED fiber-optic phosphorometer. Partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) were measured in four locations of the kidney during 1 min each. Renal cortex microcirculatory flow was assessed using 2-photon intravital microscopy and quantified using the microvascular flow index (MFI).Results: CLP resulted in higher levels of sCr (CLP 1.66 vs Sham 0.98; p < 0.001) (Fig. 1.1), Il-6 (CLP 7759.28 vs Sham 79.1; p = 0.01) (Fig. 1.2), microcirculatory dysfunction evidenced by an MFI < 2.5 (CLP 1.88 vs Sham 2.59; p = 0.06) (Fig. 1.3), and"

Importantly, the renal cortex oxygenation was higher in the CLP group (PO2: CLP: 53.7 mmHg vs Sham 41.2 mmHg; p < 0.001) (Fig. 1.5).Conclusions: Sepsis induced a decrease in renal cortical microcirculatory blood flow concomitant with an increase in cortical partial pressure of oxygen. This suggesting that local regulation of microcirculatory blood flow relative to tissue demand was impaired and that this mechanism may contribute to the development of S-AKI. Further studies will need to address if this is secondary to a mechanism akin to tissue ‘hibernation’ vs. mitochondrial dysfunction.Fig. 1(abstract P125)ResultsP126Oliguria in critically ill patients: impact on AKI classification and outcomes predictionN.

We aimed to determine their impact on AKI diagnosis, severity assessment and mortality prediction.Methods: We conducted a cohort study including all adult patients admitted to our unit between 2010 and 2020. Daily serum creatinine (sCr) and hourly urinary output (UO) measurements along with socio-demographic characteristics and severity scores were extracted. Long-term mortality was assessed by cross-referencing our database with the Swiss national death registry. We determined the onset and severity of AKI according to KDIGO classification using UO and sCr criteria separately and assessed their agreement. Using a multivariable model accounting for baseline characteristics, severity scores and sCr stages, we evaluated the relative influence of UO criteria on 90-day mortality. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of missing sCr, body weight and UO values.Results: Among the 15,620 patients included [10′330 (66.1%) males, median age 65.0 years (IQR 53.0–75.0), median SAPS score 40.0 (IQR 30.0–53.0), median follow-up 67.0 months (IQR 34.0–100.0)], 12,143 (77.7%) fulfilled AKI criteria. SCr and UO criteria had poor agreement on AKI diagnosis and staging (Cohen’s weighted kappa = 0.36, 95% CI 0.34–0.37, p < 0.001). Compared to the isolated use of sCr criteria, consideration of UO criteria enabled to identify AKI in 5,630 (36.0%) patients. Those patients had a higher 90-day mortality than no-AKI patients (respectively 12.9% and 8.3%, p < 0.001).

Identification of predisposing factors can improve standards of care and outcome.Methods: Retrospective analysis of 27 consecutive LTx recipients in Silesian Center for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland operated in 2015 and 2016. The level of AKI according to KDIGO guidelines was noted in 7 postoperative days period. Patients were divided according to KDIGO level 1 and 2 – (group A – 9 patients) and 3 (group C – 14 patients). One patient died and was excluded from analysis.Results: AKI was developed by 23 of 26 analyzed subjects (88.46%). Level 1 was noted in 3 cases (11.54%) and Level 2 in 6 (23.08%). Serious AKI - 14 patients (53.85%) and 4 of them needed renal replacement therapy. We did not find differences in preoperative creatinine levels. Patients did not differ according do age sex and BMI between groups.

PS-AKI was defined as 1) AKI stage 3 lasting ≥ 3d or with death within 3d, without intervening lower AKI stage, or 2) AKI stage 2/3 with dialysis within 3d. A second definition, PS-AKI by SCr only (PS-AKISCrO), excluded PS-AKI defined by dialysis or death. Regression models adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity, CCI, hospital characteristics (number of beds, teaching status, region, urban/rural), admission type and point of origin, medical vs surgical MS-DRG, primary payer, presence of CKD or sepsis, and ICU stay.Results: Of 126,528 AKI stage 2/3 patients, 75.6% had NPS-AKI, 24.4% had PS-AKI and 15.3% had PS-AKISCrO. Compared to NPS-AKI, PS-AKISCrO had ≥ 38% longer mean index LOS (4.8 d) and ICU LOS (2.8 d), and 11% longer readmission LOS (1.0 d).

OstermannCritical Care, Guy´s & St Thomas´ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P129Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in patients with severe respiratory failure receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, long-term renal function is rarely monitored in survivors. This study aimed to assess the long-term mortality and renal outcomes in patients receiving ECMO.Methods: This was a single-center retrospective observational study of adult patients (≥ 18 years old) who were treated with veno-venous ECMO at Guy’s & St Thomas’ Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31st, 2017. We excluded patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplant recipients, and patients who received veno-arterial ECMO. The primary outcome was 1-year mortality. The secondary outcomes were 1-year incidence of ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with and without AKI.Results: A total of 300 patients (57% male; median age 44.5 (IQR, 34–54) were included in the final analysis. Past medical histories included diabetes (12%), hypertension (17%), and CKD (2.3%). The main indication for ECMO was respiratory infection (72%). AKI occurred in 230 patients (76.7%) [AKI stage 1 (79.4%), stage 2 (7.4%), stage 3 (13.2%)]. RRT was commenced in 59.5% of all patients. Patients with AKI were more likely to have longer mechanical ventilation duration, in-hospital mortality, RRT dependence, and higher creatinine at discharge. One-year mortality was 27.8% in AKI vs. 21.4% in non-AKI patients (p = 0.18). ESRD occurred in 3 patients in the AKI group. At 1-year, only 95/237 (40.1%) survivors had creatinine results available. Among these, CKD was found in 27% of AKI patients compared with 4% in non-AKI patients (p = 0.02).Conclusions: In vv-ECMO patients, one-year mortality is non-significantly higher in patients with AKI than in those without AKI. Follow-up of renal function post-ECMO was infrequent. In patients with follow-up creatinine measurements, the CKD incidence was extremely high at 1 year.

At each study time point, we computed urea, creatinine and β2-microglobulin clearance. Results obtained in patients with COVID-19 (C19 group) were compared to those without COVID-19 (control group). Circuits’ lifespan was assessed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and compared using log-rank test.

Samples were taken before and after 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min after intravenous administration of 5 g fosfomycin during multi-filtration dialysis and withdrawal of renal replacement therapy, each in the same patient. Using E max model for time-concentration curves we determined peak concentration, time to half-maximum concentration and gamma, each for rise and fall in concentration, elimination half-life as well as area under the curve (AUC) of elimination.Results: 15 patients had a mean age of 60 (± 8 SD) years, mean weight of 88.5 (± 19.8 SD) kg and mean height of 175.6 (± 19 SD) cm. 13 patients were male. Dialysate flow was 2.4 (± 0.5 SD) l/h, blood flow 110 (± 27 SD) ml/min and ultrafiltration 73 (± 57 SD) ml/h. Fosfomycin peak concentration was significant lower during renal replacement therapy (117 µg/ml; ± 59.9 SD) compared to discontinuation of multi-filtration (143 µg/ml; ± 54.7; p < 0.05).

The final selected model was used to simulate patient concentrations to investigate the probability of different dosing regimens achieving target therapeutic concentrations.Results: 107 vancomycin dosing intervals (155 levels) in 24 patients were examined. An acceptable base model was produced (Plots of observed vs. population predicted concentrations (Obs-Pred) R2 = 0.78). No continuous covariates used resulted in a clear improvement over the base model. Use of anticoagulation modality and vasopressor use as categorical covariates resulted in similar PK parameter estimates, with a trend towards lower parameter estimate variability when using RCA or without vasopressor use. Simulations using PTA plots suggested that a 2 g loading dose followed by 1.5 g in 24 h as maintenance dose, commencing 12 h after loading, is required to achieve adequate early target trough concentrations of at least 15 mg/l.Conclusions: Simulations based on PTA plots showed we could achieve acceptable vancomycin trough concentrations early in treatment with a 2 g loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly in CVVHDF.P133Population pharmacokinetics of multiple dose fosfomycin in critically ill patients during continuous veno-venous hemodialysisK.

Studies report variable filter life despite optimal citrate protocols. The aims of this study were i) to investigate whether citrate affects thrombin generation, fibrinolysis and platelet function, and ii) to explore whether systemic blood samples are representative of intra-circuit clotting parameters.Methods: We screened critically ill patients who were prescribed CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI). Patients with known thrombotic or bleeding tendencies and patients who had been prescribed blood products or other anticoagulants were expluded. In eligible patients, we measured coagulation parameters at baseline (pre-CRRT), followed by serial measurement of thrombin generation, D-dimer and platelet function during CRRT for up to 72 h. We also compared samples taken from the arterial line with paired samples taken directly from the circuit.Results: A total of 11 patients were recruited (mean age 62.4, 82% male).

In vitro data show effective removal with a hemadsorbent system [1]. We report the first successfully treated clinical case of a lethal VPA intoxication with CytoSorb® (CS) hemadsorption after an intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) session.Methods: A 54-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department following auto intoxication with VPA, lorazepam and olanzapine. He was intubated because of lowered mental status (GCS 4). First measured VPA plasma concentration was 1320 mg/l with a free fraction of 1012 mg/l. IHD was commenced for 4 h. As VPA remained at toxic levels, a citrate-anticoagulated continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) circuit was initiated with a CS cartridge installed in pre-hemofilter position. Blood samples were collected at the adsorber in-and outlet to evaluate VPA plasma levels.Results: At the start of CVVHD and CS therapy, VPA bound and free fraction plasma levels where 525 mg/ml and 335 mg/ml respectively. Combined treatment resulted in a decline to 50 mg/ml and 0 mg/ml over the course of 30 h (Fig. 1). A total of 3 adsorbers were used. CS showed saturation in approximately 3 h.

This systematic review summarizes evidence on the impact of CS on vasopressor requirements.Methods: A systematic search was conducted (last update: May 8, 2021) and studies reporting norepinephrine (NE) doses before and after CS were selected for a descriptive analysis. Four studies in patients with hyperinflammation-induced vasoplegia that included control cohorts were used for a comparative analysis. Effect size was expressed as reduction in NE dose from baseline to 24 h.Results: Thirty-six studies totaling 447 patients reported NE dose before and after CS. Significant NE dose reduction was noted with CS (before CS: 0.55 [0.39–0.86] vs. after CS 0.1 [0.00–0.25] μg/kg/min, p < 0.001). In the comparative analysis, a statistically significant benefit after 24 h of CS was observed (Hedge's g: 1.59, 95% CI 0.48- 2.70); however, the I2statistic suggested a high heterogeneity between studies [1–4] (Fig. 1).Conclusions: Despite the limited number of studies, this analysis indicates that CS may reduce NE needs in vasoplegic shock patients.

Aim of this study is: 1- to evaluate the changes of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a key suppressor of fibrinolysis, during RRT with an adsorbing membrane; 2 - the time course of the thromboelastographic parameters.Methods: Thirty patients with sepsis and AKI were submitted to RRT with the adsorbing membrane oXiris (Baxter, USA) in CVVHDF mode integrated into the Prismaflex platform (Baxter, USA). Pre-filter citrate was used as loco–regional anticoagulation. In all the patients arterial and post-filter TEG was performed at basal time (T0) and at 24 h of treatment (T1) and an arterial sample was obtained to calculate plasmatic PAI-1 (Elisa method) at the same times.

Takeyama1, H. Mori1, T. Terajima1, M. Hattori1, S. Tanabe1, M. Tsuda1, S. Ito2, T. Irahara11Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan;2Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, JapanCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P138Introduction: Previous studies demonstrated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation augmented during COVID-19 and the levels of circulating NETs-derived molecules correlated to the severity of COVID-19. We hypothesized that removal of circulating NETs-derived molecules from the bloodstream could be an effective strategy to reduce dysregulated inflammation in COVID-19. In this study, we examined whether treatment with direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B (PMX)-immobilized fiber column (Toray Industries, Japan) can limit the progression of COVID-19.Methods: We studied, 30 COVID-19 ARDS patients, who required admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation from August 2020 to June 2021. Thirteen patients received PMX hemoperfusion within 12 h after ICU admission and blood samples were taken from them before and immediately after hemoperfusion. Plasma levels of NETs-related products including myeloperoxidase-DNA, neutrophil elastase-DNA, and cell free-DNA were measured.Results: Plasma levels of NETs-related products collected at ICU admission increased in COVID-19. This result suggests that NETs would be accelerated by COVID-19. When plasma levels of NETs-related products and cytokines were measured before and after PMX, the former significantly decreased after PMX, whereas the latter did not change. Time-course change in lymphocytes count without PMX significantly decreased at 5–7 days when compared with 0–1 days. On the other hand, patients who were treated with PMX lymphocytes counts significantly increased at 5–7 days compared with patients without PMX.Conclusions: We demonstrated that PMX membrane can effectively capture various nucleus-derived molecules. Furthermore, scavenging nucleus-derived molecules by treatment with PMX inhibited the progression of lymphopenia. Removing systemic nucleus-derived molecules from circulation by PMX may ameliorate irrelevant inflammatory and thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19.P139CytoSorb therapy in COVID-19 (CTC) patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a multicenter, retrospective registryT."

The CTC Registry was established to collect patient-level data from U.S. centers using CytoSorb under the EUA.Methods: Consecutive patients on ECMO treated with CytoSorb were included. Retrospective data collection included demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 medications, inflammatory biomarkers, and details on ECMO and CytoSorb use. Study follow-up was to hospital death or discharge. Primary outcome was ICU mortality. Comparisons between survivors and non-survivors were performed to evaluate predictors of mortality. Up-to-date information from the international Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) ECMO COVID-19 Registry was considered to help contextualize the results.Results: Fifty-two ECMO patients treated under EUA from April 2020 to April 2021 were enrolled from 5 U.S. centers. Baseline characteristics were comparable to the ELSO Registry except for higher rates of obesity in the CTC cohort. ICU mortality rates in the CTC cohort were 17.3% at 30 days, 26.9% at 90 days, and 30.8% overall. Gender, age, baseline SOFA, baseline D-dimer levels, and CytoSorb use between survivors and non-survivors are shown in the Table. Regression analyses suggested a borderline association between baseline D-dimer levels and mortality, with 32% increase in the risk of death per 1 µg/ml increase (p = 0.055). CytoSorb was generally well tolerated without any unanticipated device-related adverse events reported.Conclusions: Combined use of ECMO and CytoSorb in critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with mortality rates that compared favorably to international benchmarks. Elevated baseline D-dimer levels appeared to be associated with increased risk of mortality.Table 1(abstract P139)Comparison of survivors and non-survivors in the CTC ECMO cohortSurvivors (S) vs. Non-Survivors (NS)S (n = 36)NS (n = 16)p valueMale67% (24/36)63% (10/16)0.764Age (years)47.4 ± 9.5451.2 ± 7.380.161SOFA score at start of CytoSorb therapy6.3 ± 3.648.3 ± 4.130.104Baseline D-dimer levels (µg/ml)2.0 ± 1.322.1 ± 36.70.056Duration of CytoSorb therapy (hours)79.4 ± 27.7288.3 ± 35.110.326Time to therapy after ECMO start (days)2.3 ± 6.632.8 ± 4.540.781Time to therapy after ICU admission (days)6.1 ± 7.409.1 ± 5.600.168P140The SCRAM bag: a"

The Pediatric Structured CRitical Airway Management (SCRAM) bag has been designed to rationalise and standardize the approach to pediatric airway management. We hypothesized that the use of the SCRAM bag in hospital on first exposure, with no prior training would perform at least as well as standard practice.Methods: Twelve participants, comprising a combination of anesthetic registrars, operating department practitioners and pediatric emergency department nurses, were randomized into two groups and asked to prepare a ‘kit dump’ for a simulated pediatric emergency using either a standard resuscitation trolley or the SCRAM bag. Following at least a 2-week wash out period, each participant completed a second simulation using the alternative equipment set. The primary outcome measured was time taken to kit dump completion. Secondary outcome measures were the number of errors and self-reported cognitive load.Results: Use of the SCRAM bag resulted in a shorter time to kit dump completion (95% confidence interval: 44.5 + 35.6; 8.9 to 80.1 s). This is an average reduction of 11.5%. 20% fewer errors and an average of 9.8% reduction in cognitive load were observed in the SCRAM group.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the SCRAM bag performed as well as established emergency airway preparation systems in the hospital setting. The SCRAM bag did not increase time to readiness nor increase errors, despite this being the first exposure with no prior training. This highlights ease of use which provides the user with the advantages of equipment standardization, portability and cognitive aids integrated within the SCRAM system.P141Do-not-intubate order and prolonged high flow nasal cannula therapy in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure related to COVID-19A.

Purpose: Assess mortality in patients affected by HRF due to COVID-19 with a DNI order treated with HFNC. Identify predictive factors for mortality in this cohort. Compare the use of HFNC and mortality between a first and second pandemic wave of COVID-19.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of all COVID-19 patients with a DNI order that received HFNC in UZ Brussel between March 6, 2020, and the January 1, 2021. Besides 30-day mortality, we focused on APACHE III score and P/F ratio at the start of HFNC. Furthermore, to evaluate an evolution in HFNC use, a comparative analysis was made between patients treated during the first and the second COVID-19 wave.Results: A total of 57 patients treated with HFNC had DNI orders with a 30-day mortality of 84%. Higher APACHE III and lower P/F ratios at the start of HFNC were predictors for mortality. APACHE III scores higher than 47 had a positive predictive value for mortality of 97%. Survivors had a median APACHE III score of 45 (IQR 40–48). In the first wave, the duration of HFNC therapy was 3 (IQR2-5) vs. 6 (IQR3-10) days in the second, p = 0.005. Mortality was comparable 85% vs. 84%.Conclusions: COVID-19-patients with HRF and DNI orders treated with HFNC have high mortality. Patients in the second wave received significantly longer HFNC therapy compared to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, without improved survival. APACHE III at the start of HFNC is an early predictor for mortality with a high positive predictive value. In high APACHE scores with DNI orders, palliative care should be considered, as prolonged HFNC therapy does not improve the outcome.Fig. 1(abstract P141)ROC curve and diagnostic accuracy of APACHE III for prediction of mortality, applied to COVID-19 patients with DNI orders; x-axis: 1-specificity; y-axis: sensitivity; AUC: area under the curve; 95% CI: 95% confidence intervalP142Safety for health workers of bronchoscopy in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumoniaA.

The Indications for A-VDL were neck/facial anatomical abnormalities, super-obesity or El Ganzouri Risk Index > 6. We collected data about the timing of sedation, drugs used and dosage, level of sedation, procedure success/failure, complications, patient’s explicit memory, and comfort.Results: A-VDL was successful in all the patients: 23 were allocated to A-VDL intubation and 1 to A- videobronchoschopic intubation due to an A-VDL Cormack-Lehane score of 4.

The COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase in NAT doctors re-deployed to ICU, bringing its own challenges. This quality improvement project aimed to assess the impact of simulation training on the confidence of NAT doctors to manage tracheostomy emergencies.Methods: A self-assessment survey and multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ) were distributed to NAT doctors in a tertiary center ICU to assess their confidence and knowledge in managing a tracheostomy emergency. They were subsequently invited to participate in simulation sessions based around the National Tracheostomy Safety Project algorithm [2]. Management of a tracheostomy emergency up to the point of primary oxygenation was demonstrated on a simulation dummy. Participants then ran through scenarios including blocked and displaced tracheostomy tubes. Trainees completed the same MCQ and survey post-intervention. The aims were to train a minimum of 80% of our NAT doctors in the ICU and increase the average confidence score to manage an emergency to ≥ 3/5 (on a Likert scale 1–5: 1 = not at all confident/familiar, 5 = very confident/familiar).Results: Twenty-one out of 26 NAT doctors participated in a simulation (80.1%). Twenty-two doctors completed the pre-simulation survey, and 16 completed a post-simulation survey.

Herein, we report our experience with the use of NIV.Methods: This was a prospective observational study was conducted between April 01, 2020 and April 31, 2021 in our ICU. Patients were monitored clinically and with serial arterial blood gas analysis. NIV was started with initial inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 6–8 cm of H2O and was gradually increased to achieve clinical response. The success of NIV, duration of NIV use, hospital mortality, and improvement in clinical parameters were assessed. The failure of success of NIV was defined as a subsequent requirement of invasive ventilation.Results: A total of 64 patients were included. The mean age of the study population was 62 years. 34 were men. Community-acquired pneumonia (83%) and pulmonary edema (17%) were the most common causes of respiratory distress. The ARDS criteria were found in 45 patients. NIV was used in 54 patients (84.3%), NIV with prone in 47.2% and NIV with High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) in 38.9%. The use of NIV was failed in 25 subjects, while 32 subjects required intubation with an average delay of 4 days. The mortality rate was 31% with positive correlation with NIV failure. Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 100 (p = 0.02), comorbidity (p = 0.01) and ICU delay admission ≥ 7 days (p = 0.038) and acute renal injury (0.01), are significantly associated with NIV failure. The use of prone position and HFNC combined with NIV decrease significantly endotracheal intubation.Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, NIV is feasible can decrease the rate of tracheal intubation and mortality particularly if combined with prone and HNFC.P146Development of an interactive intubation checklist for use on mobile devicesJ.

AlonsoIntensive Care, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, AustraliaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P148Introduction: Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is an aerosol-generating procedure with high risk of clinician exposure and infection by SARS-CoV-2. Protective barrier enclosures have been found to complicate ETI and prolong intubation times, posing a potential threat to patient safety. We designed a novel barrier mouthpiece (Airway Shield) for use during ETI, to reduce risk of clinician exposure to airborne pathogens without complicating the procedure. Our study aims to demonstrate Airway Shield's efficacy in reducing airborne particle exposure in a preclinical model.Methods: We performed a preclinical simulation trial of ETI using a C-Mac videolaryngoscope in manikin models to evaluate laryngoscopist exposure to airborne particles (droplets (> 5 microns) and aerosols (< 5 microns)) with and without 3-D printed prototypes of Airway Shield (Fig. 1). A self-contained clinical simulation lab and a manikin (AirSim, TruCorp®) with droplet and aerosol-generating equipment using normal saline were used for simulation. Airborne particle generation during intubation was measured in 2 clinical scenarios (CPR and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)) during induction, initial laryngoscopy, and endotracheal tube placement. ImageJ software was used to estimate airborne particle dispersion using automatic pixel quantification applied to manually selected polygonal areas. Student's T-test"

MacLoughlin11R&D Science and Emerging Technologies, Aerogen Ltd., Dangan, Galway, Ireland;2Medical Affairs, Aerogen Ltd., Dangan, Galway, IrelandCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P149Introduction: High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) is used for oxygen supplementation and the application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in spontaneous breathing patients. Jet nebulizers (JN), require a driving gas flow to operate and disconnection from the high flow circuit for drug refill. For vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN), drug is refilled without breaking the circuit and does not require a driving gas flow. The objective of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the impact of nebulizer drug refill on PEEP during HFNT in a simulated adult model.Methods: A VMN (Aerogen Solo, Aerogen, Ireland) or a JN (Cirrus 2, Intersurgical, UK) was connected to a high flow system (O2FLO, Inspired, HK) at 50LPM, with nasal cannula placed on an anatomically correct head model. The head model was connected to a breathing simulator (ASL 5000, Ingmar Medical, USA) set to simulate an adult breathing pattern (Vt 500 ml, 15BPM, and I:E 1:1). The JN was driven with compressed air at 8LPM. This additional gas flow was accounted for in the total high flow gas rates applied. PEEP was recorded using a pressure sensor (Citrex H5, IMT, Switzerland), placed at the level of the lung.Results: During the JN drug refill process, the applied PEEP in the lung drops to near zero (p < 0.0001). This might be explained by the need to break the circuit in order to add drug to the medication cup. On the other hand, the VMN was seen to have no significant effect on PEEP (Table 1) as it remains closed during drug refill (p = 0.84). This could be explained by the VMN design wherein the ventilatory circuit remains intact and drug refill is completed by opening the silicon cap on the medication cup.Conclusions: This study provides key information"

AlmutairiRespiratory Care, King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P150Introduction: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) are the modes of ventilation that applied positive pressure to keep the airways continuously open by using a mask or interface. It is widely use in managing COVID-19 patients in COVID-19 wards and in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main challenges in managing the COVID-19 patients is how to improve oxygenation and to avoid deterioration leading to ICU admission, intubation and sometimes death.Methods: The data were collected precisely using Non-invasive Ventilation Flowsheet and Introduction-Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation (ISBAR) handover tool from the month of May 2020 to October 2020. Data collected includes the type of mask use, number of patients with improved oxygenation, number of patients without improvement, diagnosis of patients, comfortability of mask by applying skin barrier and arterial blood gas results.Results: Based on the patient’s data collected for the month of May up to October 2020, 82% of COVID-19 patients who used CPAP therapy outside ICU improved their oxygenation, while about 18% of them showed no signs of improvement then later intubated. On the first three months of the study, success rate in improving oxygenation of patients after using CPAP were between 91–95% (Fig. 1). The success rate eventually drops significantly on month of August and September due to surprising increase of COVID-19 cases which overwhelms the number of RT staff assigned and also the supply of proper mask sizes became scarce. Not long enough, additional RT staff were trained and assigned to COVID-19 patients and arrival of mask supplies late-month of September that causes rebound in success rate to 75% on month of October.Conclusions: Improvement of oxygenation in COVID-19 patients using non-invasive ventilation is critical prior to patient deterioration and requires proper management of trained healthcare personnel and availability of resources.Fig. 1(abstract P150)ResultsP151Percutaneous tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 supported by ECMOA.

There is little literature regarding the safety of PDT for patients with COVID-19 on ECMO. The primary objective is to assess the safety of PDT in COVID-19 patients on ECMO. Secondary objectives are complications within 48 h, healthcare workers (HCWs) cross infection.Methods: A single center retrospective review of electronic ICU data of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection supported by ECMO at Hamad General Hospital, Doha-Qatar from 01/03/20 to 01/01/21.

One of 17underwent surgical tracheostomy is excluded from final analysis. In 14/16 patients, the median duration of anticoagulant infusion hold prior to PDT was 7 h (IQR 7–15.8). No major complications were observed within 48-h. 12/16 experienced none to mild bleeding; 19% (3/16) experienced moderate bleeding (obvious bleed with up to1 g/dl drop of hemoglobin and/or require at least 1 unit of blood product transfusion); and 6% (1/16) experienced severe bleeding within 48 h of PDT (a drop of 2 + g/dl of hemoglobin; needed 2 or > transfusion units or surgical intervention). 4/16 of the COVID-19 patients had a positive PCR test result on the day of PDT. Each PDT involved 3 HCWs: an operator, a respiratory therapist and an ECMO nurse specialist. None of the HCWs involved tested + ve for the virus within 2 weeks post-PDT.Conclusions: 25% of patients suffered moderate to severe non-life-threatening bleeding. None of ICU involved HCWs suffered COVID-19 transmission. Experienced operator, minimal trauma and strict adherence to PPE are essential.

We compared this to a cohort treated within one of the ICUs prior to the pandemic, from 2015–19. Patients were included if treated for ARDS secondary to bacterial, viral or aspiration pneumonitis, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy insertion.Results: Tracheostomy insertion was performed in 25 (28.1%) of 89 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 positive patients.

A combination of these characteristics is possessed by hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) [1–3].Methods: We examined 60 patients diagnosed with a new coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The control group consisted of 30 patients (13 men, 17 women, 64.5 ± 12.7 y.o.), study group - 30 patients undergoing HBO (14 men, 16 women, 61.5 ± 14.5 y.o.). HBO sessions were carried out in a Sechrist 2800 machine (USA) in the 1.4–1.6 ATA mode for 40–60 min. In total patients received 153 HBO sessions (5.1 ± 2.5 sessions per patient).Results: Depending on the severity of the condition SpO2values could reach 95% after 1–2 sessions in moderately severe patients and after 5–6 sessions in patients in severe condition. This circumstance made it possible in most cases to refuse additional oxygen therapy during the HBO course or within 1–2 days after its completion (Fig. 1).

Mora OrdoñezIntensive Care Unit, HRU Málaga, Málaga, SpainCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P157Introduction: One of the devices most used in patients with severe respiratory infection caused by SARS-Cov2 has been HFNC (high flow nasal cannula), with the aim of preventing progression to IMV. It is important to have scores that allow predicting the success or failure of this therapy, avoiding unnecessary delays in the initiation of IMV.Methods: To assess the prognostic capacity of the ROX Index in patients with severe respiratory infection due to SARS-Cov2 with HFNC. We evaluated 20 patients admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory infection with CRP + SARS-CoV-2 who required respiratory support on admission with HFNC. The following variables were collected: demographic data, ROX index at admission, 12 h, 24 h, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h, duration of NFNC, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, stay in ICU, mortality in ICU.Results: The mean age was 63.9 years ± 11.5. 85% males. The median time of HFNC was 4.5 days. The mean stay in the ICU was 12 days ± 6.9. 65% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Mortality was 50%. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation had lower ROX index values in the first 48 h compared to the group that did not require MV, however, we did not find a statistically significant association (95% CI p > 0.05). The patients who required mechanical ventilation presented higher mortality with significant differences (95% CI p = 0.029). We did not observe differences in mortality associated with the duration of previous HFNC in patients who required IMV.Conclusions: We observed an adequate correlation between the ROX index and HFNC failure in patients with severe respiratory infection due to SARS-CoV-2.P158Dose-dependent effect of diaphragm neurostimulation on GFAP serum concentrations in pigs mechanically ventilated for 50 hT.

Richardson, H. Altemimi, M. Blunt, P. YoungITU, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King´s Lynn, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P161Introduction: The accidental use of a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) in a heated and humidified ventilatory circuit causes sudden and catastrophic obstruction of the HME in hours. Water saturates the filter and blockage is usually sudden with average time to occlusion between twelve and twenty four hours [1]. An NHS safety alert (2015) identified 76 reported incidents in England [2]. The Humidicare (Medovate, Cambridge, UK) warns of an impending problem by reacting to the heated humidifier (HH) with a color change and caution message. Removal of the Humidicare is prompted before waterlogging occurs. We evaluated device ability to deliver. Warning within the relevant timeframe and to ensure immunity to heat and humidity from a simulated patient.Methods: We performed a randomized study in a simulated ICU environment using a Maquet ventilator and mechanical lung. Time to Humidicare warning delivery in a HH circuit (n = 10) was compared to behaviour in a control circuit without HH (n = 10). Fisher & Paykel HHs were used. A secondary HH on the lung side emulated patient behaviour to demonstrate no confounding factors.Results: All HMEs activated in HH arm. Color change started after a mean of 31.4 s ± 2.76 s (95% CI). The warning message was fully developed after a mean of 93.6 s ± 8.09 s (95% CI). No HMEs were triggered in the control arm after five minutes.Conclusions: The Humidicare HME seems to reliably indicate the problem in a timely manner. It does not register false positive with the heat and humidity coming off a patient equivalent. Occasional errors are hard to eliminate with traditional information dissemination techniques and training; improved response is achieved with engineered solutions [3]. The Humidicare protects staff and patients by helping comply with NHS safety standards to prevent errors.COI: Young: share of patent ownership.ReferencesDoyle A et al.

This phenomenon is reported as highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the risk factors of SH in COVID-19 ICU population.Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of institutional database of COVID-19 patients treated in the ICU during the year of 2020. The SH was defined as a respiratory rate below 20 bpm and by two groups of PaO2/FiO2ratio: ≤ 300 to 200 (indicating mild ARDS) and ≤ 200 (indicating moderate to severe ARDS) upon admission to the ICU; the latter was selected for further analysis. Demographic data, co-morbidities and other variables were entered into the regression analysis of SH risk factors. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS IBM v24.Results: A total of 228 patients were included in the study. 62.3% were women (n = 142), mean age of 61.52 (SD = 13.5), and APACHE II score of 13.42 (SD = 7.21). The prevalence of SH was 18.9% (n = 43) in mild ARDS group and 11.8% (n = 27) in severe to moderate ARDS group. Univariate regression analysis revealed count of days before admission to ICU (Exp(B) = 1.09 CI 95: 1.02–1.17, p = 0.013) and lymphocyte count (Exp(B) = 1.29 CI95: 1.01–1.67, p = 0.046) as risk factors of SH. Multivariate regression model of these determinants revealed count of days before admission to ICU (Exp(B) = 1.09 CI95: 1.01–1.17, p = 0.025) as an independent prognostic factor of SH. Further analysis of days before admission to ICU showed median of 12 [7.8–14.3] for SH group and median of 7.5 [4–11] for non-SH group (p = 0.003), overall group – 8 [4–11].Conclusions: SH is prevalent in COVID-19 patients and is dependent on the definition criteria. Prolonged disease course before ICU admission is an independent risk factor of SH.P163Performance of automatic endotracheal cuff management deviceU. Borg, K. BullMedtronic, Boulder, USACritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P163Introduction: Effective control of endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressure (CP) is vital to airway management in intubated patients. CP must be kept within a therapeutic range to ensure adequate cuff seal and delivery of mechanical ventilation, while preventing against complications such as ischemia, aspiration, and stenosis [1]. The purpose of this study was to test the CP management device PBACC (Puritan Bennett Automatic Cuff Controller, Medtronic, Boulder, USA) and evaluate maintenance of cuff seal in an animal model during mechanical ventilation.Methods: Eight animals with tracheal sizes suitable for 5.0 to 8.0 mm inner diameter ETTs were intubated. The cuff was inflated to a pressure of 25–30 cmH2O, as recommended in instructions for use."

Animals were in supine position for 60 min, followed by lateral position for 60 min. Supine position was assumed again for 30 min, followed by opposite lateral position for 60 min. Fluoroscopy was obtained five minutes after position change and at the end of each position period. Images were examined for dye in the trachea below the cuff.Results: There were no statistical differences between the PBACC pressures and the reference. No cuff leaks were detected on fluoroscopy.Conclusions: CP may change due to change in position, slow cuff leaks and other causes, making routine monitoring of CP necessary to maintain correct pressure. Automated cuff management devices have been suggested to remedy this situation. The PBACC maintained CP during all position changes resulting in no breach of cuff seal. These results may indicate that the PBACC device is suitable for continuous CP management. Longer-term clinical studies are needed to demonstrate its clinical utility.ReferenceSole M et al.

Delgado AmayaHRU Málaga, Intensive Care Unit, Málaga, SpainCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P165Introduction: Faced with a patient with difficult weaning, we must evaluate all the factors involved. Diaphragmatic dysfunction, due to injury or atrophy, plays a key role in these patients, so it is important to carry out an adequate assessment, for this we can use diaphragmatic ultrasound, which is a useful, non-invasive tool available at the bedside.Methods: We evaluated a 62-year-old patient with a history of hypertension, DM2 and obesity (BMI > 30) who was admitted to the ICU due to severe acute respiratory failure due to SARS-Cov2 requiring ECMO support with good evolution, currently in the weaning phase of respiratory support Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed due to difficult weaning. She is stable at the hemodynamic and respiratory levels, with a good level of consciousness (RASS 0), adequate cough, but with significant paresis due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. We monitor diaphragmatic mobility through ultrasound during the weaning process. Diaphragmatic ultrasound is performed at the level of the right hemithorax, at the 7-8th rib in the mid-axillary line. We monitor diaphragmatic mobility through diaphragmatic excursion.Results: We started a SBT in CPAP 8 cmH2O for 60 min, measurements were made after 30 min showing a diaphragmatic excursion between 22-26 mm. Subsequently, we removed the ventilator and switched to a humidifier with 50% FiO2, we performed a new ultrasound control after 30 min, presenting a diaphragmatic excursion between 18–22 mm. After 4 h, the patient begins to be fatigued, with use of accessory muscles, although he maintains SpO298%. We repeat ultrasound, presenting a 16–17 mm diaphragmatic excursion. We again connected in PS 10 cmH2O over 6 cmH2O PEEP, FiO240%, after 60 min we repeated the ultrasound control again, presenting a diaphragmatic excursion between 20-24 mm.Conclusions: Monitoring of diaphragmatic mobility by ultrasound is useful and simple, it is a tool to consider in patients with difficult weaning.Fig. 1(abstract P165)A) CPAP 8 cmH2O, FiO240% 30 min, B) tracheal mask oxygen FiO250% 30 min, C) tracheal mask oxygen FiO250% 4 h, D) support pressure 10/6 PEEP FiO240% 30 minP166Monitoring the"

Assisted ventilation may prevent diaphragm atrophy, facilitating weaning. Nevertheless, a high drive could increase transpulmonary pressure causing patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) [1]. The diaphragmatic electrical activity (EAdi) can be continuously monitored at the bedside and is a reliable surrogate of the neuro-ventilatory drive. Objectives: To evaluate neuroventilatory drive, in terms of Eadi, during pressure support ventilation (PSV) in critically ill patients with COVID-19.Methods: Eadi was continuously recorded for 30 min during PSV in 8 patients. PSV was set on clinical basis. For each mechanical breath, Eadi peak, VT, RR were measured. The Eadi peak was classified as LOW: between 1–5 μV; NORMAL: between 5–15 μV; HIGH: over 15 μV.Results: The figure shows the distribution of LOW, NORMAL and HIGH Eadi during the 30 min. There was no difference in terms of VT and RR in the three different Eadi classes (VT: 0.43 ± 0.04 l, 0.43 ± 0.10 l 0.47 ± 0.05 l for LOW, NORMAL and HIGH Eadi respectively and RR: 25.52 ± 3.06 b/min, 22.97 ± 5.10 b/min, 21.02 ± 2.52 b/min for LOW, NORMAL and HIGH Eadi).Conclusions: The incidence of high neuro-ventilatory drive during PSV in our cohort of COVID-19 patients was 25.83%. The fact that VT and RR were similar among the Eadi classes suggests that the clinical detection of P-SILI may be difficult. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the incidence of high respiratory drive may influence the duration of mechanical ventilation and other clinically meaningful outcome parameters.ReferenceEsnault P et al.

This study aimed to assess changes in the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and IVC collapsibility index (IVCcl) as a predictor for the development of postoperative pulmonary edema.Methods: In the period from October 2020 to May 2021, one hundred patients scheduled for the major noncardiac surgical procedures were included in this observational study. TAPSE and IVCcl were measured the day before and the day after the procedure. Development of pulmonary parenchymal opacity, as a sign of pulmonary edema, was monitored by lung ultrasound.Results: Changes in preoperative vs postoperative TAPSE measurements were seen: TAPSE 25 mm 2 vs 0 patients, TAPSE 24 mm 22 vs 8 patients, TAPSE 23 mm 21 vs 6 patients, TAPSE 22 mm 28 vs 15 patients, TAPSE 20 mm 20 vs 28 patients, TAPSE 19 mm 7 vs 37 patients and TAPSE 18 mm 0 vs 6 patients. Preoperative measurements showed that 73 patients had IVC diameter ≤ 2 cm with IVCcl > 50% and 27 patients had IVC diameter ≥ 2 cm with IVCcl > 50%. In the postoperative period, 47 had IVC diameter ≤ 2 cm of which 25 patients had IVCcl > 50% and 22 IVCcl 35- 50% while 43 patients had IVC diameter ≥ 2 cm of which 31 patient with IVCcl 35–50% and 12 patients with IVCcl < 35%.

Inclusion criteria: PaO2/FiO2ratio < 300 mmHg and/or respiratory distress, requiring helmet CPAP. Exclusion criteria: unstable hemodynamics and Glasgow coma scale < 15. Blood gas analyses, respiratory mechanics and oesophageal pressures were collected during supine position and 3 h after the initiation of prone position. For statistical analysis, a fully scripted data management pathway was created within the R environment for statistical computing, version 3.6.1.Results: The results are shown in Table 1. In particular, we observed that prone positioning was associated with a PaO2/ FiO2ratio increase from 166 [136, 224] mmHg to 314 [232, 398] mmHg (p < 0.001). Respiratory work, estimated as the product of esophageal pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate, decreased from supine (65 [46, 88] cmH2O*l/min) to prone position (51 [34, 67] cmH2O*l/min) (p < 0.001).

ACE inhibition was found to be beneficial, but its hypotonic effect impedes clinical application [2]. Here we tested, whether additional manipulation of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) by blocking aminopeptidases can alleviate this undesired effect.Methods: Anesthetized mice (C57/BL6, 18–28 g, 8–10 weeks) were mechanically ventilated with low or high tidal Volume (LVT, 6 ml/kg; HVT, 30 ml/kg) for 4 h, and treated with the ACE inhibitor Lisinopril (0.15 ug/kg/min) with or without aminopeptidase inhibitor (ALT00) at 2.7, 10 or 100 ug/kg/min. BALF was analyzed for inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, KC, MIP-2 and IL-1β) by ELISA. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured continuously in the right carotid artery. Equilibrium concentrations of RAS metabolites in plasma were measured by LC tandem MS.Results: ACE inhibition decreased ventilation-induced inflammatory cytokines and MAP. Co-treatment with ALT00 reduced inflammation and increased dose dependently levels of Ang 1–7, an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic RAS metabolite. Various doses had mixed effects of normalizing MAP and reducing cytokine secretion.Conclusions: Combined manipulation of the RAS system might represent a promising new treatment strategy for VILI requiring further mechanistic exploration.ReferencesBaumgardner JE et al.

The progression of ventilatory parameters during the first four days evidenced a significant increase in the energy delivered to the respiratory system in the no survivors patients compared with survivors patients, especially in the ventilator inspiratory power (4.82 vs 0.2 J/min) p: 0.04. There is a trend of increase of adjusted ventilator inspiratory power (8 vs 0.2 J/min/kg ideal body weight*10) ventilator work (0.18 vs -0.03 J) and adjusted ventilator work (0.3 vs 0 J/kg ideal body weight*100). No significant difference was found in the trend of driving pressure over the first four days of support.Conclusions: More than the absolute value in the ventilatory parameters at the beginning of mechanical ventilation support, the trend to increase in the ventilator inspiratory power over the first days of mechanical support, could be better associated with mortality in ARDS patients due to COVID-19.P174Performance of Access IL-6 assay in predicting risk for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patientsN.

Elevated IL-6 has been shown to identify patients at risk of hypoxemia and need for mechanical ventilation [1].Methods: A retrospective cohort study enrolled adults presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) between March 18 and May 4, 2020 with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and who were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. All patients had blood samples drawn at ED presentation and tested with the Access IL-6 assay on Unicel DxI 800 immunoanalyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc.). Results of radiological studies and respiratory treatments (non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, nasal cannula) were extracted from the medical charts. An IL-6 cut-off of 35 pg/ml based on literature was utilized for the analysis [1].Results: Seventy-five RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were initially enrolled. The prevalence of mechanical ventilation in this cohort was 32% with a median time from sample draw to mechanical ventilation of 4 days, and a mortality of 17%. 10 patients were excluded, as despite having severe hypoxemia, died before receiving mechanical ventilation.

Data from low- and middle-income countries for COVID-19 ARDS are limited. Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa expanded its ICU service to support patients with COVID-19 ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We report on patients' characteristics and outcomes from two pandemic waves.Methods: All adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS admitted to ICU for IMV were included in this prospective cohort study. Data were collected from 5th April 2020 to 5th April 2021. Ethical approval was granted (HREC: 362/2020). Consent was obtained for survivors and waived for patients who died.Results: Over the 12-month study period, 461 patients were admitted to the designated COVID-19 ICU. Three-hundred-and-eighty patients met study criteria and 377 had confirmed hospital discharge outcomes. The median age of patients was 51 years (range 17–71), 50.5% were female and the median BMI was 32 kg/m2 (IQR 28–38). The median P/F ratio was 97 (IQR 71.5–127.5) after IMV was initiated. Co-morbidities included diabetes (47.6%), hypertension (46.3%) and HIV infection (10.5%). Of the patients admitted, 30.8% survived to hospital discharge with a median ICU length of stay of 19.5 days (IQR 9–36). Predictors of mortality after multivariate analysis were: male (OR: 1.79), increasing age (OR: 1.04), higher SOFA score (OR: 1.29).Conclusions: In a resource limited environment, escalation of ICU IMV support achieved a 30.8% hospital survival in patients with COVID-19 ARDS.

Microglia are key cells that initiate and control inflammation in the brain, behaving either as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cells. We investigated whether transvenous temporary diaphragm neurostimulation (TTDN) in synchrony with MV, a hybrid ventilation strategy, mitigates neuroinflammation.Methods: Thirty-one healthy juvenile pigs (4–5 months, 48–66 kg) with non-injured lungs were divided into four groups: MV only (MV group, n = 10), MV in association with diaphragm neurostimulation delivered either every other breath (TTDN50% + MV group, n = 8) or every breath (TTDN100% + MV group, n = 7) and never ventilated (NV group, n = 6). TTDN targeted a reduction in pressure–time product between 15 and 20%. Volume control MV was set to achieve and maintain a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Hippocampus samples were harvested, and IBA-1 assay was used to stain microglia. Machine learning software classified microglia cells as either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory based on cellular biometric characteristics. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range. The Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used for statistical analysis. P values £0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: Microglia percentages were dependent on TTDN dose. Differences in percentages of IBA-1-positive hippocampal cells were statistically significant between groups, p < 0.0001 (Fig. 1). Microglia from the TTDN100% + MV group had cellular characteristics statistically indistinguishable from the NV group.Conclusions: TTDN mitigates neuroinflammation after 50 h of MV.

However, complications such as cannula displacement could be life-threatening, and the benefits of PP whilst on ECMO are yet to be proved. Our study aimed to assess safety of proning patients on VV-ECMO and try to identify signs of potential benefit of this therapy.Methods: Retrospective data collection from electronic Pt notes including: demographics; SARF aetiology; CT findings; indication; number of PP sessions; duration of ECMO and complications. Pre- and post-P/F ratio, ventilator and ECMO settings were compared. The data were analyzed using statistical software SPSS®Results: Fifty-two ECMO Pts (71% male; 46 ± 14 years-old; BMI 29 ± 6 kg/m2) were PP from 2016–2021. 73% survived to ECMO decannulation and were discharged from our center. ECMO duration was 26 ± 18 days. The most frequent etiologies of SARF were community acquired pneumonia (38.4%) and COVID-19 pneumonitis (23.1%). CT chest prior to PP documented consolidation in 94.2% and bilateral infiltrates in 84.6% A high PEEP CT was performed in 16 Pts, showing recruitability in 81%. Most patients were proned for recruitment (32.7%) or due to refractory hypoxia (30.8%). Ventilator and ECMO support decreased with PP (FiO2on the ventilator 0.5 ± 0.2 vs 0.4 ± 0.2; p = 0.001; ECMO blood flow (4.4 ± 0.8 vs 4.2 ± 0.8 l/min; p = 0.006). A significant improvement in the following variables was seen after PP: lung compliance (19 ± 17 vs 25 ± 20 ml/cmH20; p = 0.014), P/F ratio (137 ± 102 vs 180 ± 126; p = 0.001) and 100% test (17 ± 10 Kpa vs 31 ± 16 Kpa, p < 0.001). Two Pts required emergency deproning due to oropharyngeal bleeding and one due to sudden drop in ECMO flow. Otherwise, no major adverse events (ECMO cannula removal, accidental extubation or central vascular access removal) were documented.Conclusions: PP in VVECMO support therapy seems to be safe and is associated with improvement in lung mechanics and oxygenation.

TurcoElectrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, NetherlandsCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P181Introduction: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is difficult to detect consistently since it relies on visual inspection of the waveforms. However, the development of automatic detection methods is hampered by the lack of properly labelled ventilation data. One solution would be to utilize artificially generated data. In this study, we compared the performance of a detection method based on clinical data to a detection method based on simulated data.Methods: The detection method was based on a neural network that was trained to detect the start and end of the patient breathing efforts, as described in [1]. In our work, two different datasets were utilized to train the network. The first dataset consisted of clinical data and the second consisted of simulated data obtained from the model in [2].

Being an overall low-volume high-cost form of therapy, the effectiveness of having care delivered in segregated units across a geographical locality is debatable. Longitudinal trends in outcomes of ECMO patients managed in high- and low-case volume centers are not well described.Methods: This was a retrospective observational study including all adult ECMO cases admitted to public hospitals in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2019.

Follow up (4.3 ± 2.9 years after ECMO therapy) was successful in 94 patients, with 71 (75.5%) patients being still alive. Hospital survivors showed a high 6- and 12-month survival rate (89.4% and 85.1%, respectively, Fig. 1). QoL interviews were completed for 53 patients. Mean SF-36 score was 70.7, SGRQ score 19.3% and HADS score 7.4.Conclusions: This analysis with a long follow up period showed very encouraging long term survival rates of VV ECMO therapy survivors. Moreover, SF-36, SGRQ and HADS showed a low level of remaining physically, respiratory and mentally limitations.Fig. 1(abstract P185)Kaplan–Meier survival estimation for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy survivorsP186Procedural characteristics of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndromeJ.

Understanding the differences between survivors and deceased patients is crucial for developing tomorrow’s therapy.Methods: We report retrospective data of a single-center registry of patients with severe ARDS requiring VV ECMO support between 10/2010 and 04/2020. Vital parameters, laboratory values and blood gas analysis as well as the level of support of ECMO therapy, ventilator settings and catecholamine therapy of the first 10 days after ECMO cannulation were analyzed with regard to their association with survival.Results: A total of 283 patients with complete medical data could be analyzed (age 53 years, 66% male). Overall ECMO weaning and hospital survival rate were 52.8% and 44.8%, respectively. Survivors showed a lower level of ECMO support after day 2 (blood flow and sweep gas flow) and day 3 (fiO2, p < 0.05, Fig. 1). Pulmonary compliance and tidal volume were higher in survivors after day 1. Moreover, survivors showed a lower noradrenaline dosage in the first 8 days and a lower fluid balance in all 10 days. Interestingly, positive end-expiratory pressure, driving pressure, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, lactate and bilirubin showed no or no clinical significant association to survival.Conclusions: In this analysis of the first 10 days of ECMO therapy, there were major differences in the level of ECMO support, tidal volume and pulmonary compliance as well as fluid balance and required noradrenaline dosage between survivors and non survivors.Fig. 1(abstract P186)Parameters associated with outcome in patients with ongoing VV ECMO therapy.

DavidsDepartment of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South AfricaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P188Introduction: Intensive care units are tasked with the mammoth responsibility of caring for the sickest patients. These patients are often in critical condition and despite best medical therapy, mortality remains high. The end of life scenario is commonplace in these units placing health care staff under immense occupational and emotional pressure. In South Africa these pressures are compounded by additional issues of financial constraints and limited resources on the background of great demand. The author explores the impact of these external factors on the ethical and moral standing of intensivists when contending with end of life decisions.Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive analysis was performed on data obtained from an anonymized questionnaire survey of healthcare workers in the intensive care unit. The questionnaire was developed and guided by similar studies and covers aspects of end of life decisions, sedation and analgesia and explores the pressures of the critical care environment. Face validation of the survey was performed. Ethical clearance obtained via Stellenbosch University REC 11,786.

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) frequently require deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade to optimize mechanical ventilation.Methods: We assessed the incidence of over-sedation and delirium in COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients and sought any differences between those with and without ARDS. Depth of sedation was monitored through use of continuous processed EEG. Delirium was evaluated through use of the CAM-ICU. The main outcomes were the incidence of over-sedation and delirium and the correlation between them in COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS. A total of 78 patients were included into the study, 38 of whom ad ARDS, 21 of whom had COVID-19 disease.The mean monitoring time for the COVID-19 and the non-COVID-19 patients was respectively 43 and 50 h. Thirty-eight (49%) of the total 78 patients fulfilled the criteria for over-sedation.Results: There was a statistically significant association between the incidence of delirium and over-sedation (OR 11.4, p < 0.001) and age (OR 1.04, p = 0.017) (Fig. 1). When adjusting for age, over-sedation was still significantly associated to delirium (OR 8.35, p = 0.002).

It supports the use of continuous EEG-based monitoring systems for the quantification of sedation depth and highlights the necessity for larger, randomized trials to verify whether monitoring the depth of sedation can improve outcome.Fig. 1(abstract P189)Incidence of oversedation and delirium in COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19and ARDS vs non-ARDS patientsP190Endogenous glucose production and gluconeogenesis: are they predictable?

Berger11Intensive Care Unit, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland;2Computational Fluid Dynamics, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland;3Institute of Physiology, University, Lausanne, SwitzerlandCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P190Introduction: Feeding a patient the closer to his/her needs is a challenge in the intensive care unit (ICU), avoiding both under- or over-feeding and their associated complications and mortality [1–3]. But ICU patients have an unrepressed endogenous glucose production (EGP) [4, 5], an energy source not considered by classical energy balance. This study aims at identifying clinically available variables predictive of EGP and gluconeogenesis (GNG), which otherwise need isotopic tracers.Methods: This exploratory study is based on the data from the Supplemental Parenteral Nutrition study 2 (SPN2) [5], which measured EGP and GNG at days 4 and 10 in 23 ICU patients. The correlations between EGP and GNG and 83 potential clinical indicators were explored, using single-stage and multivariate analysis.Results: On single-stage analysis, the strongest correlations were norepinephrine dose at day 4 with GNG (R = 0.71; p = 0.0004), and at day 10, VO2with GNG (R = 0.59, P = 0.04), and VCO2with EGP (R = 0.85, p = 0.00003). Cumulated insulin dose between days 5 and 9 was correlated to EGP at day 10 (R = 0.55, p = 0.03). Our multivariate model could predict EGP at day 4 with an error coefficient (EC) between 7.8% and 23.4% (minimal and maximal error), and GNG at day with an EC of 18.5% and 29.9%. GNG at day 4 and EGP at day 10 could not be predicted with an EC < 40%.Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that GNG and EGP have different predictors on days 4 and 10; EGP is more correlated with the metabolic level, while GNG is dependent on external factors. Some variables could be identified to assess the magnitude of both values. Our results suggest that a robust model might be built, but require a prospective study including a larger number of patients.ReferencesZusman O et al. Crit Care 20:367, 2016Dissanaike S et"

Singer11Intensive Care Unit, Beilinson hospital, Petah Tikva, Israel;2Industrial Engineering and Management, Ariel University, Ariel, IsraelCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P191Introduction: The aim of the study is to examine the association between feeding intolerance (FI), defined by different gastric residual volume (GRV) thresholds, and clinical outcomes in enterally fed critically ill patients. “Large” GRV is a key criterion used in most FI definitions, yet due to conflicting evidence, the determination of the optimal GRV threshold remained an unresolved issue.Methods: We included adult patients (2012–2018) admitted at Beilinson hospital ICU for more than 48 h. FI definition is based on the occurrence of “large” gastric volumes (thresholds of 150, 250 and 500 ml), GI symptoms and “inadequate” delivery of enteral nutrition [1]. Admission conditions and FI occurrences, along 72 h, were analyzed by machine learning classification algorithms predicting mortality and morbidity. Prediction performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUROC) of ten-fold cross-validation and validation sets for 3 GRV thresholds.Results: The dataset comprised of 1782 enterally fed patients. The median (IQR) age was 62 (48–72) years, BMI 26.5 (23–31). Main admission conditions: surgical (47%), trauma (27%) and medical (25%). Five algorithms were trained and tested (Python software). The best performing algorithm was Random Forest classifier. Models with GRV threshold of 250 ml achieved the best results (AUC = 0.82–0.87, depending on outcome metric), followed by models using GRV threshold of 150 ml (AUC = 0.81–0.86) and models using GRV threshold of 500 ml (AUC = 0.76–0.85). Valuable predictors in the models were GRV > 250 ml or GRV > 150 ml in 72 h.Conclusions: FI occurrences along 72 h of ICU admission, using GRV threshold of more than 250 ml, have the best performance in predicting clinical outcomes in enterally fed critically ill patients.Acknowledgments: This study was funded by Fresenius-Kabi.ReferenceReintam-Blaser et al., Nutr Clin Pract 36:1, 2021P192A handheld device to detect CO2after insertion of nasogastric feeding tubesJ.

Here we report first results of a handheld point of care device to demonstrate usability of CO2detection.Methods: NGTs were inserted in 30 patients in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital intensive care unit. Data collection included: conventional pH measurement of aspirate (if obtained) and CO2detection using the DoubleCHEKTM device (https://enteralaccesstech.com). NGT location on CXR was also recorded. Users were asked to complete an evaluation form containing device experience questions and allowed free-text comments.Results: Evaluation of the device was completed in 29/30 (96.67%) of cases. Aspirates were obtained in 14/30 (46.67%) cases with 7/14 (50%), resulting in a pH of < 5.5 as measured by conventional pH strips. Of the 16/30 (53.33%) insertions yielding no aspirate, 3/16 (18.75%) were clinically located in the lungs. In these insertions, CO2was detected, the NGT was removed, and a second insertion attempt was successful as indicated by CXR or pH < 5.5. Of the 7/30 (23.33%) cases in which aspirates were obtained, but pH reading was > 5.5, six of seven (85.71%) CXRs showed that NGTs were in the stomach, and no CO2was detected with the DoubleCHEKTM device. Only 2/29 (6.8%) users would object to using the device in daily practice.Conclusions: Simultaneous pH and CO2detection is a promising method to avoid misplacement of NGTs. Difficulties in obtaining aspirates and high pH are common problems in NGT placement [1]. Further clinical trials are warranted to determine sensitivity and specifity of the technique compared to standard protocols and to evaluate the cost-saving potential.ReferencePailsey et al.

Yamamoto21Department of Anesthesiology, Obihiro Kosei Hospital, Sapporo, Japan;2Obihiro Kosei Hospital, Sapporo, JapanCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P197Introduction: Thyroid storm (TS) is an endocrine emergency, which is a rare and life-threatening condition. It occurs suddenly leading to a high mortality rate if not recognized immediately and treated aggressively. However, due to its rare incidence, there is a lack of information about the manifestations of TS. The present study aimed to evaluate important aspects of epidemiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of TS.Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study on patients diagnosed with thyroid storms in our hospital between January 2011 and December 2020. The definition of TS was used by the Japanese Thyroid Association criteria [1]. We obtained information on the patients’ clinical characteristics and outcome from medical records.Results: Six patients were included in this study. The median and the interquartile range (IQR) of age were 45 [41–52] years old. The SOFA score on ICU admission was 3.5 [3.0–4.8] and the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale was 65 [60–81]. The thyroid function test revealed free triiodothyronine (fT3) level of 13.58 [9.78–20.00] pg/mL (normal range: 2.3–4.0), free thyroxine (fT4) level of 6.00 [4.41–6.53] ng/dL (normal range: 0.9–1.7), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) < 0.003 μIU/mL (normal range: 0.5–5.0). All patients exhibited abnormal tachycardia and altered mentation. The symptoms of the patients mostly included fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Melia21Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, UK;2Dept of Anaesthesia and Critical Care, Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P199Introduction: In 2018 a teaching program for doctors starting their first rotation in critical care was created at Whipps Cross Hospital; Intensive Care Essentials (ICE), covering basic knowledge and practical skills [1]. Here, we reflect on its evolution, evaluate feedback and assess whether it is still fit for purpose.Methods: The program is delivered as a mixture of lectures and practical workshops. It aims to introduce core critical care topics, helping to alleviate anxiety felt by new starters. Initially the attendees were new doctors, but it has since been expanded to include new nursing staff. The themes covered remain unchanged: mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, cardiac output monitoring, inotropes and vasopressors, sedation and delirium, renal replacement therapy, and airway management, but the content within each theme has been modified according to feedback from previous courses. This year, we have also had to make adjustments to enable smaller groups in line with covid social distancing advice. Attendees were sent a pre- and post-course questionnaire, asking them how strongly they agreed with certain statements using a Likert scale (1-strongly disagree, 5-strongly agree). Unpaired t-tests were used to compare pre- and post-course results, and these were in turn compared to data from previous courses.Results: Feedback from 2021 (Table 1) demonstrated that after the course, attendees felt significantly more prepared for ICU clinical work (mean pre-course score 2.47 (SD = 0.94), mean post-course score 3.03 (SD = 1.26), p < 0.01) and more knowledgeable (mean pre-course score 2.88 (SD = 0.96), mean post-course score 4.04 (SD = 0.56), p < 0.01). These findings were similar to previous courses.Conclusions: Feedback was consistently positive in all domains over all courses run since 2018.

J. Jones1, D. H. Hepburn21Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK;2Intensive Care Unit, Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P200Introduction: Every new admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) prompts a handover from the referring department to the ICU staff. This step in the patient pathway provides an opportunity for information to be lost and for patient care to be compromised. Mortality rates in intensive care have fallen over the last twenty years, however, 20% of patients admitted to an ICU will die during their admission [1]. Communication errors contribute to approximately two-thirds of notable clinical incidents; over half of these are related to a handover [2]. NICE have concluded that structured handovers can result in reduced mortality, reduced length of hospital stay and improvements in senior clinical staff and nurse satisfaction [3].Methods: A checklist was created with doctors and nurses to review the information shared and to score each handover. This was relevant for handovers between all staff members. Information was gathered prospectively by directly observing 17 handovers on the ICU.Results: There is a notable discrepancy in the quality of handovers of new patients (Fig. 1). This is true of handovers between doctors, nurses and a combination of the two. It is also true of all staff grades. Whilst a doctor may have reviewed the patient prior to their arrival, 41% (n = 7) of patients were not handed over to a doctor. The most commonly missed pieces of information were the patient’s weight (96%, n = 16), their height (100%, n = 17), whether they had previously been admitted to an ICU (78%, n = 15) and whether they had any allergies (71%, n = 12).Conclusions: The handover of new patients to the ICU is often unstructured and information is missed. This is true for all staff members and grades, and for handovers from all hospital departments. Standardising handovers could improve their efficiency and effectiveness.References:ICS.

Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) scoring systems are designed for ICU mortality prediction. APACHE scoring systems are not validated in critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study aims to assess and compare the predictive value of APACHE II and IV for ICU mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Methods: All adult patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of Jessa Hospital, Hasselt, Belgium between March 13, 2020, and October 17, 2020, were included in this retrospective, cohort study. APACHE II and APACHE IV scores were calculated within 24 h after admission. The performances of the APACHE scoring systems were evaluated by means of logistic regression models with ICU mortality as the dependent variable and one of the scoring systems as an independent variable. Discrimination for mortality was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves. tenfold cross-validation was used to obtain more conservative estimates of the discriminative abilities of the prediction tools. The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit (HL) test was used to assess calibration.Results: In total, 116 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU between March 13, 2020, and October 17, 2020. 13 COVID-19 patients were excluded for various reasons, leaving 103 patients in the statistical analysis of the overall population. Table 1 shows the results of the cross-validated discriminative abilities and the HL test.Conclusions: APACHE IV on admission provided the best discrimination and calibration for ICU mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients compared to APACHE II.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine parameters for inclusion in the final risk score. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by means of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test respectively. Internal validation was conducted using the regular bootstrap technique.Results: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 13.6% (n = 166).

The population included was 92 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with COVID-19, and 240 patients who received IMV with non-COVID-19 illness before the pandemic. Follow-up data were collected using self-reported questionnaires. The main outcome measures were self-reported fatigue severity and the prevalence of significant fatigue at 3–12-months post-hospital discharge.Results: COVID-19 IMV-patients were significantly younger with less prior comorbidity, and more males, than pre-pandemic IMV-patients. At 3-months the prevalence (87.5% [7/8] vs. 82.4% [155/188]) and severity (median 5.5/10 vs. 5.0/10) of fatigue was similar between COVID-19 and pre-pandemic populations respectively.

In the COVID-19 population, women under 50 experienced more severe fatigue, breathlessness, and worse overall health state compared to other COVID-19 IMV-patients (adjusted mean difference 2.58, 95%CI: -0.19 to 5.35).

Study selection: Two reviewers independently screened studies to identify observational studies of adult ICU patients that explicitly examined the association between sex and treatment intensity, specifically mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and length of stay. Data extraction: We extracted data independently and in duplicate: mean age and illness severity of women and men, length of stay in ICU and hospital, use of and duration of mechanical ventilation and use of renal replacement therapy. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale and used a Dersimonian-Laird random effects model to calculate pooled odds ratios and mean differences between women and men.Results: We identified 21 studies with a total of 545,538 participants (42.7% women). The study populations ranged from 246 to 261,255 participants (median 4420). Most studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain, for example not adjusting treatment intensity outcomes for illness severity or other potential confounders.

We aimed to summarize the evidence regarding the use of frailty tools in COVID-19, assessing the risk of frail patients for in-hospital and 30-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospitalization (LOH).Methods: The protocol was prospectively registered via PROSPERO (CRD42021241544). We conducted a systematic search up to 03.02.2021 with terms related to COVID-19 and frail* in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. Studies reporting on frailty in COVID-19 patients were eligible. We compared in-hospital and 30-day mortality, LOH and ICU admission in frail and non-frail COVID-19 patients. Search, selection, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessmentwere conducted in duplicate by two independent authors. The QUIPS tool was used for the RoB assessment. Odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2and χ2tests.Results: From 1693 records, 27 were included in the qualitative and 21 in the quantitative synthesis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used in 24 studies. We found that frail patients (CFS 5–9) compared to non-frail patients (CFS 1–4) have a higher risk for both in-hospital (OR: 2.77; CI: 1.86–4.15) and 30-day mortality (OR: 1.47; CI: 1.05–2.06). Frail patients were less likely to be admitted to ICU: CFS 4–9 (OR: 0.13, CI: 0.09–0.17); CFS 5–9 (OR 0.05, CI: 0.01–0.16); (Table 1). Quantitative synthesis for LOH was not feasible.

Beattie1, P. Henderson2, M. Shaw2, T. Quasim21School of Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK;2University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P207Introduction: Relative to the general hospital population, ICU survivors experience high levels of morbidity following hospital discharge, leading to high rates of unplanned hospital readmission. If we can predict which patients are at highest risk of readmission, targeted outpatient interventions can be made to prevent use of costly emergency healthcare resources. Existing models to predict readmissions, designed for the general hospital population, have poor predictive performance in the ICU survivor cohort. We set out to create a parsimonious, ICU-specific model to predict emergency readmission in ICU survivors.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on patients discharged alive from hospital following ICU admission from a single Scottish ICU between April and October 2018. Patients were split into derivation and validation cohorts using an 80:20 random split. A logistic regression model was developed using the derivation cohort; performance of the model was determined using the validation cohort.Results: A total of 121 of 402 patients (30.1%) experienced unplanned readmission within 90 days of hospital discharge. The model consists of eight predictors which predict 90-day emergency hospital admissions with a discriminatory c-index of 0.75 (0.70–0.80). Significant predictors in the multivariable model were: number of emergency admissions in year prior to ICU admission (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.25, 1.83) and number of elective admissions in year prior to ICU admission (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.41). Table 1 illustrates the performance of the model as a screening tool.Conclusions: Emergency hospital readmissions are common in this ICU survivor cohort. This simplistic model can be used as a screening tool at hospital discharge to identify patients at high risk of emergency hospital readmission. This allows risk stratification of need for outpatient support. Further consideration should be given to exploring modifiable risk factors for readmission to improve the cost-effectiveness and clinical utility of post-ICU outpatient care.Table 1(abstract P207)Performance of risk prediction model as a screening tool to identify patients at risk of emergency hospital"

Spataru, M. Angelova-Chee, V. MetaxaCritical Care, King’s College Hospital, London, UKCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P208Introduction: Old adults are the fastest-growing segment of the population in many developed countries [1]. Data paucity on the post-ICU outcomes in this population is perpetuated by the reluctance of physicians to admit very old patients (VOP) to the ICU [2, 3]. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and the short and longer-term outcomes of critically ill VOP.Methods: We included all patients aged 80 y/o and over admitted to the ICU of a large tertiary hospital in 2018. We collected patient demographics (including frailty scores) along with data on admission diagnoses, treatment escalation decisions, and mortality. Frailty scores were assigned based on admission functional status, using a 9-item clinical frailty scale (CSF) [4].Results: A total of 191 patients with a median age of 84 (IQR 82–87 y/o) were included. More than half (51%) were frail and almost a quarter (23%) had a do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) order in place before ICU admission. Most VOP were admitted emergently (93.7%), with a non-surgical diagnosis (78.5%). Details on the interventions undertaken in both groups are shown in Table 1. In our cohort, the ICU mortality was 30.4% and the 1-year fatality rate 60.2%. Higher frailty was associated with lower ICU death (16.3% vs 45.2%, p < 0.001), but similar hospital and long-term mortality. Factors associated with non-survival at 1 year were higher SOFA scores (OR 1.2, 95%CI 1.001–1.4), DNACPR status on admission (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.1–6.5), and non-surgical pathology (OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.5–8.8).Conclusions: Most of the VOP survived their ICU stay and almost 40% of them were alive at 1 year. Our results do not support ICU admission bias against this population. However, as we did not examine long-term sequelae, the burden of critical illness on functional outcomes could not be assessed.ReferencesWaite LJ. Popul Dev Rev 30:3–16, 2004.Guidet B et al.

Volunteered-surgical resident trainees were recruited for this study. Low-cost box-trainer was used. Evaluative score was calculated after peg transfer task in optimal ergonomic settings then in non-optimal ergonomic settings. The principal judgment criterion was the difference between the scores.Results: First- and second-year participants accounted for 57% of all participants. Ten participants (33%) had no experience with minimally invasive surgery simulation. Twenty-two participants (73%) weren’t aware about ergonomic principles. None of the participants had experienced ergonomic-dedicated simulations in minimally invasive surgery. The mean score obtained after peg transfer in optimal ergonomic settings was 107.0 (extremes: 19 and 220) versus 54.8 (extremes: 0 and 191) in non-optimal ergonomic settings. The difference was 39.6 in median (extremes: 7.3 and 70.1) with a statistically significance. Multi variant analysis retained only the resident year as an independent factor associated to the accomplished scores after comparison of the scores reached by first- and second-year residents versus those of third-, fourth-, and fifth-year residents.Conclusions: The impact of the box-trainer was the awareness rise about the importance of ergonomics in minimally invasive surgery, the application of these concepts, and the work environmental enhancement allowing better security for both sanitary staff and patients.P210Models of care in geriatric intensive care (MAGIC): a scoping review on the models of care for critically ill older adultsT.

Geriatric ICU patients present unique challenges in terms of management due to their physiology and comorbidities. We aim to review models of care of geriatric population in critical care settings.Methods: We conducted a scoping review on critically ill older adult hospitalized in critical care settings. Medline (PubMed), Embase (OvidSP), CINAHL (Ebsco) and Web of Science (Clarivate) were searched from inception to 28 August 2019, with a subsequent review of Pubmed made in May 2020. Nineteen articles were selected for the review.Results: Four models of care could be extracted from this review: dedicated geriatric beds, geriatric assessment by geriatrician, geriatric assessment without geriatrician, and other models of care including checklists, bundles of care, and incremental education strategies. Because of an absence of comparative studies, the optimal model of care could not be identified through our review.Conclusions: Four models of care with varying applicability and resource requirements were identified. Additional studies will be necessary to determine the optimal model of care.P211Modeling of COVID-19 pandemic to estimate the demand of mechanical ventilatorsY. Yuan, C. TianPhilips Research, Philips, Shanghai, ChinaCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P211Introduction: The emergence of several variants is associated with COVID-19 rebound in many countries and regions with higher transmission advantage, and additional demand on medical resources including mechanical ventilators (MV). It can be challenging to estimate the demand by using infection rate of population, given the epidemiological response varies over time due to different factors such as pathogen variant, non-pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, we modeled the outbreak with time-varying epidemiological response to estimate the demand of MV in a dynamic way.Methods: Confirmed cases and fatalities in six countries (US, Italy, UK, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil), were collected from COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University. We performed a Long-short term memory (LSTM) model to predict confirmed cases and fatalities at 8th day by using data for past 7 days. Data from Jan 22 to May 14, 2020 were split into training (80%) and validation (20%) dataset. Internal testing dataset was from May 16 to May 24, 2020, while Taiwan data from May9 to Jun16, 2021 were used as external testing. The root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) was used to evaluate the model performance.

After the tough but efficient first wave struggle, the Veneto Region in Italy faced a more difficult second surge. We aimed to describe the COVID-19 critically ill pts admitted to our hospital (AOUI of Verona) during the second wave.Methods: Prospective observational study of all COVID-19-confirmed critically ill pts, treated at our ICUs between 1 Oct 2020 to 2 Feb, 2021. Date of final follow-up was May 1, 2021. Demographic and daily clinical data were collected, including data on organ failure, management and outcome.Results: According to our treatment protocol, all pts received dexamethasone 6 mg/day,therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH and were supplemented with Vit C and D. 212 pts were included in the analysis, the median age was 65 ± 11 years and 161 (76%) were male.164 (77%) had cardiovascular disorders,43 (20%) had diabetes, overall BMI was 28.7(26–31); 105(49.5%) pts received pre-hospital antibiotic therapy. 112 (53%) pts were admitted from an intermediate care medical ward while 18 (8.5%) were transferred from another hospital ICU. APACHE II and SOFA scores were 17 ± 8 and 9.4 ± 3.1; 171 (80.7%) pts had only respiratory failure, while 17.3% of them were on vasopressors upon ICU admission.

We included all patients consulting the emergency department, regardless of the reason. The predictive factors of a COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR or by a typical appearance on the chest CT scan were sought.Results: We included 5241 patients. The sex ratio was 0.97. The mean age was 44.6 ± 18 years. Thirty-five percent of patients were smokers. The most common medical history in our patients was hypertension (23.9%), diabetes (19.5%), asthma (7.8%), and coronary artery disease (7.7%). The reasons for consultation were dominated by cough, dyspnea, nausea or vomiting, and fever, in 9.5, 8.5, 8.8, and 6.9% of cases respectively. The concept of exposure was observed in 3.1% of patients. The concept of contact with a suspected case was observed in 1.3% of patients, while contact with health personnel was observed in 6.3% of patients. Suspicion of covid 19 infections was found in 2.3% of patients. Eighty-nine percent of patients were managed in the emergency department. Independent predictors of COVID-19 infection in multivariate analysis were: fever (adjusted OR = 21.19, p < 0.01), breathing difficulties (adjusted OR = 16.49, p < 0.01), neoplasia (adjusted OR = 15.93, p < 0.025), and contact with health care personnel (adjusted OR = 5.78, p < 0.019).Conclusions:"

FivezAnesthesiology and Intensive Care, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk, BelgiumCritical Care2021,25(Suppl 1): P214Introduction: In early spring, Belgium was struck hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting one of the highest mortality rates in the world [1]. Our hospital, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (ZOL), is situated in Limburg, which was the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis in Belgium, reporting the highest infection rate of all Belgian provinces [2]. National guidelines concerning admission criteria on ICU of patients with a COVID-19 pneumonia were lacking. This is a single center retrospective analysis of patients that would be have been excluded from ICU according to the NHS COVID-19 decision support tool [3]. All patients admitted to the ICU with a confirmed COVID-19 pneumonitis from March to June 2020 were included in the analysis.Methods: Categorical data were represented as numbers and percentages. The distribution of continuous data was analyzed and represented as either mean ± SD or median and IQR. No data imputation was done as for all variables the missings were less than 15%. All p values were two-sided and considered significant when < 0.05. All analyses were performed with JMPsoftware version 15.0.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).Results: Ninety-seven patients were admitted to the ICU. Mean APACHE III was 67(n16), with a predicted ICU mortality of 30%. The ICU mortality rate was 20.6% (n20). 44% (n44) patients would not be admitted to the ICU according to the NHS guidelines. The mortality in this group was significantly higher 38% (n17).Conclusions: Although mortality is significantly higher; 28% of our population (n27) would not be admitted to the ICU according to the NHS COVID-19 decision support tool; although they did survive. Follow-up of these patients is planned.References:How well have OECD countries responded to the coronavirus crisis?

We recorded the epidemiologic characteristics of our cohort of patients in order to determine which factors, if any, could have a positive effect on ICU survival.Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in a 13-bed capacity ICU. On admission age, gender, preexisting comorbidities (arterial hypertention, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, pulmonary disease), and disease severity scores APACHE II and SOFA were recorded. Duration of stay and final outcome were also noted. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test checked normality. An unpaired student T-test was performed for continuous variables. Analysis of variance (Anova) tested for differences in the means between categorical and continuous variables.Results: Between December 24, 2020, and May 28, 2021, 64 patients (70.3% male) with median age 64.5 years were ICU admitted. 51 patients (79.6%) were under invasive mechanical ventilation and 13 patients were on HFNC. 14 patients died (21.8%). Survivors in relation to non-survivors were male (p = 0.028), younger (p = 0.000) and had lower APACHE II score (p = 0.030). We investigated whether age, number of comorbidites, obesity, duration of ICU stay, and severity scores could predict patients’ outcome. The model explained 98% of the variance and it was a significant predictor of outcome [F(6,3) = 27.99, p = 0.01]. While obesity (B = -0.43, p < 0.039), SOFA (B = -0.88, p = 0.04) and APACHE II scores (B = 1.13, p = 0.004) contributed significantly to survival, age (p = 0.09) total comorbidities (p = 0.07) and duration of ICU stay (p = 0.14) did not.Conclusions: Nonobese patients and low SOFA scores had better outcome in this cohort of patients.

This led to rapid development of guidelines by the University Hospitals Birmingham COVID-19 Working Group for the immediate management of severe respiratory disease in September 2020. We audited the adherence of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s (QE) intensive care units (ICUs) to these guidelines during wave 2.Methods: Adherence targets were set at 90% for three core guideline aspects: 7–10 days of dexamethasone administration, lung protective ventilation (LPV), and microbiology investigations (HIV, sputum culture, urinary legionella). This was a retrospective audit, with data collected from patients admitted to QE ICUs between September to November 2020 the electronic Prescribing Information and Communications System (PICS) system. Data was analyzed using Excel.Results: A total of 88 patients were included. The only investigation that met the 90% target was HIV testing (100%).

The aims of this retrospective study were to assess PNI prevalence three months (M3) after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge, and to search for some risk factors.Methods: During the first and second waves of the pandemic, all COVID-19 adults who survived an ICU stay ≥ 7 days were included if they attended the M3 consultation at our follow-up clinic. PNI referred to limb weakness, pain, hypoesthesia or paresthesia. Data about demographics, medical history, ICU stay (illness severity, duration of MV, PP, neuromuscular blocking agents and insulin; corticosteroids, peak of glycemia, creatine kinase and C-reactive protein) and M3 outcomes (autonomy using Barthel index, quality of life (QOL) using EQ-5D scale) were recorded. Data are expressed as median (Q1-Q3).Results: Fifyt-six patients (age 62 (55–71)y, all obese, SAPS II 35.62 (16–82)) survived an ICU stay of 20 (3–64)d for COVID-19 pneumonia and were followed at M3. From them, 75% (42/56) received MV during 17 (11–25)d, and 55.4% (31/56) patients had at least one PP session. At M3, 41.1% (23/56) declared motor and/or sensitive symptoms of PNI, located mainly at feet, thighs, hands and arms. PNI significantly impacted Barthel index: 100 (70–100) vs 100 (90–100) in survivors with and without PNI, respectively (p = 0.013). Their QOL was similar. After multivariate binary logistic regression with stepwise selection, MV duration was significantly associated with PNI (p = 0.037), independently of a wave effect. The other parameters were not associated with PNI.Conclusions: In this cohort, at least 40% of critical COVID-19 survivors presented PNI 3 months after ICU discharge, associated with a significant alteration of autonomy. Only MV duration was observed as a potential independent risk factor. A larger cohort is needed to complete these preliminary results.P220Correlation of persisting post-discharge symptoms in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with severity of the diseaseP. M.

Factors potentially associated with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms were explored in patients hospitalized in COVID-19 medical wards and/or ICU.Methods: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease (severe and non-severe) hospitalized and successfully discharged at home were evaluated for persisting clinical symptoms and performed lung spirometry, lung CT scan and echocardiography. Blood sampling for IgG SARS-CoV-2 detection by the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was done. Factors influencing persisting symptoms for more than one month after the patients’ discharge were analyzed by descriptive statistics and ROC curve for serum antibody titers and severity of the infection.Results: Among 45 patients, men (n = 30, 66.7%) with mean age (± SD) 59.62 (10.25) years and mean BMI (± SD) 30.62 (4.41) kg/m2presented after a mean post-discharge time of 71.11 days, COVID-19 was severe in 20% of cases. Comorbidities (62.2%) included hypertension (n = 15), dyslipidemia (n = 13), diabetes mellitus (n = 6). Echocardiography revealed mild (n = 28) or moderate (n = 2) diastolic dysfunction, being normal in 9 patients. In 35% of CT scans fibrotic lesions were detected. Lung spirometry was abnormal in 21/36 patients (58.3%) more often in those with persisting symptoms > 1 month after discharge (p = 0.05): fatigue (90.3%), dyspnea (38.7%), cough (38.7%), myalgias/arthralgias (35.5%), loss of smell/taste (35.5%) and dizziness (19.4%). Mean (± SD) IgG SARS-CoV 2 titer was 234.42 (130.10) AU/ml whilst most seriously ill patients during hospitalization present the highest titer [ROC AUC 0.787 (95%CI 0.657–0.918)].Conclusions: More than 50% of patients presented with persisting symptoms -predominantly fatigue- for > 1 month post-discharge and abnormal spirometry even if only 20% of patients had severe disease during hospitalization which correlated with higher post-discharge SARS-COV-2 IgG titers.P221Impact of coronavirus 19 pandemic on children after their discharge from pediatric intensive careL.

We are describing the repercussions of the COVID-19 lockdown on the physical and psychological wellbeing of PICU survivors and their families, their quality of life and their accessibility to medical resources and extrafamilial support.Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and families followed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) follow-up clinic from October 2018 to February 2020. Patients and parents were contacted by phone by a pediatric intensivist to fill out validated questionnaires (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to medical care and extrafamilial support.Results: Fifty-five families were contacted between November and December 2020. Quality of life scores were 88.1 ± 16.9 and 83.8 ± 13.9 for physical and psychosocial aspects, respectively. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were detected in 23.6% and 3.6% of respondent parents, respectively. A significant proportion of families reported cancelled health appointment (65.5%) and medication access issues (12.7%). Twenty-five families (45.5%) reported a significant decrease in their familial financial incomes.Conclusions: PICU survivors and their families experience significant impact on medical care and familial organization during the COVID-19 pandemic.References:Cacioppo M et al 2021 Ann Phys Rehabil Med 64:101429, 2021.P222Limitation of life-sustaining treatment in critically ill patients admitted in ICU with SARS-CoV-2 pneumoniaA.
