Although uncommon, life-threatening musculoskele-tal injuries must be properly assessed and managed. Most extremity injuries are appro-priately diagnosed and managed during the secondary survey.3 It is essential to recognize and manage in a timely manner pelvic fractures, arterial in-juries, compartment syndrome, open fractures, crush injuries, and fracture-dislocations.Knowledge of the mechanism of injury and history of the injury-producing event enablesthe doctor to be aware of what associated conditions potentially exist with the injuredextremity. Early splinting of fractures and dislocations may prevent serious complicationsand late sequeiae. In addition, an awareness of the patient's tetanus immunization sta-tus, particularly in cases of open fractures or significantly contaminated wounds, mayprevent serious complications. Armed with the proper knowledge and skills, as outlinedin this chapter, the doctor can satisfactorily provide the initial management for mostmusculoskeletal trauma,\n\nVirkelyst C, Hougaard S, Kehlet H.

The examiner needs to askabout characteristics of the injury incident and prehospitalcare. Remember, open wounds may not bleed, but may beindicative of nerve injury or an open fracture.\n\nSTEP 1. deformed which indicative\n\nSplint extremities, are of a fracture or joint injury, before patient transport or as soon as is safely possible.STEP 2.Assess the color of the extremity. The presence of bruising indicates muscle injury or significant soft tissue injury over bones or joints. These changes may be associated with swelling or hematomas. Vascular impairment may be first identified by a pale distal cxtrcmity.STEP 3.Note the position of the extremity, which can be helpful in determining certain injury patterns. Certain nerve deficits lead to specific positions of the extremity. For example, injury to the radial nerve results in wrist drop, and injury lo the peroncal nerve results in fool drop.STEP 4.Observe spontaneous activity to help determine the severity of injury. Observing whether the patient spontaneously moves an extremity may suggest to the examiner other obvious or occult injuries. An example is a patient with a brain injury who does not follow commands and has no spontaneous lower-extremity movcment; this patient coulcl have a thoracic or lumbar Fracture.STEP 5.Note gender and age, which are important clues to potential injuries. Children may sustain growth plate injuries and fractures that may not manifest themselves (eg, buckle fracture). Females are less likely to have urethral injuries than vaginal injuries with a pelvic fracture.STEP 6MObserve drainage from the urinary catheter. lf the urine is bloody or catheter insertion is difficult, the patient may have a pelvic fracture and a urologic injury.\n\n[\"ife- and limb-threatening injuries are excluded first.\n\nSTEP 1. Palpate the pelvis anteriorly and posteriorly toassess for deformity, motion, and/or a gap thatindicates a potentially unstable pelvis.

Attention to the basic principles of initial trauma re-suscitation and timely application of simple emergencymeasures can help to minimize the morbidity and mortal-ity caused by these injuries. These principles include a highindex of suspicion for the presence of airway compromisefollowing smoke inhalation, identification and managementof associated mechanical injuries, and maintenance of he-modynamic normality with volume resuscitation. The doc-tor also must take measures to prevent and treat thepotential complications of thermal injuries, such as rhab-domyolysis and cardiac dysrhythmias, which are sometimesseen in electrical burns. Temperature control and removalfrom the injury-provoking environment also are majorprinciples of thermal injury management.\n\nImmediate Lifesaving Measuresfor Burn Injuries\n\n? What is my first priority?\n\nLif esaving measures for patients with burn injuries includeestablishing airway control, stopping the burning process,and establishing intravenous access.\n\n? How do / identify inhalation injury?\n\nAlthough the larynx protects the subglottic airway from di-rect thermal injury, the airway is extremely susceptible toobstruction as a consequence of exposure to heat. Airway\n\nobstruction may not be obvious immediately; however,signs may be present that can warn the examiner of poten-tial airway obstruction. When a patient is admitted to thehospital after sustaining a burn injury, the doctor should bealert to the possibility of airway involvement, identify signsof distress, and initiate supportive measures. Clinical indi-cations of inhalation injury include:\n\n● Face and/ or neck burns\n\n● Singeing of the eyebrows and nasal vibrissae\n\n● Carbon deposits and acute inflammatory changes inthe oropharynx\n\n● Carbonaceous sputum\n\n● History of impaired mentation and/or confinementin a burning environment\n\n● Explosion with burns to head and torso\n\n● Carboxyhemoglobin level greater than 10 % in pa-tient who was involved in a fire\n\nAny of the above findings suggests inhalation injury.Transfer to a burn center is indicated if there is inhalation in.jury. If the transport time is prolonged, intubation should beperformed prior to transport to protect the airway. The symp.tom of stridor is an indication for immediate endotracheal in.tubation. Circumferential burns of the neck can lead toswelling of the tissues around the airway. Theref ore, early in-tubation is indicated in this situation.\n\nSTOP THE BURNING PROCESS"

Syn-thetic fabrics can ignite, burn rapidly at high tempera-tures, and melt into hot residue that continues to burn thepatient. Any clothing that was burned by chemicals shouldbe removed carefully. Dry chemical powders should bebrushed trom the wound, with the individual caring forthe patient avoiding direct contact with the chemical, andthe involved body-surface areas should be rinsed withcopious amounts of tap water. The patient then shouldbe covered with warm, clean, dry linens to preventhypothermia.\n\nAny patient with burns over more than 20% of the bodysurface requires fluid resuscitation. After establishing airwaypatency and identifying and treating immediately life-threatening injuries, intravenous access mustbe established.I.arge-caliber (at least #16-gauge) intravenous lines shouldbe introduced immediately in a peripheral vein. If the ex-\n\ntent of the burn precludes placement of the catheter throughunburned skin, overlying burned skin should not deterplacement of the catheter in an accessible vein. The upperextremities are preferable to the lower extremities for ve-nous access because of the high incidence of phlebitis andseptic phlebitis when saphenous veins are used for venousaccess. Begin infusion with an isotonic crystalloid solution.Guidelines for establishing the flow rate are outlined laterin this chapter.\n\nThe assessment of patients with burn injuries begins withthe patient history and is followed by estimation of thebody-surface area burned and the depth of the burn injury.\n\nThe injury historyis extremely valuable in the treatment ofthe burn patient. Associated injuries can be sustained whilethe victim attempts to escape the fire, and injury from ex-plosions can result in internal injuries or fractures (eg, cen-tral nervous system, myocardial, pulmonary, and abdominalinjuries). It is essential that the time of'the burn injury be es-tablished. Burns sustained within an enclosed space suggestthe potential for inhalation injury.\n\nThe history, from the patient or a relative, should in-clude a brief survey of preexisting illnesses (eg, diabetes, hy-pertension, cardiac, pulmonary, and/or renal disease) anddrug therapy, as well as any allergies and drug sensitivities.The patient's tetanus immunization status also should beascertained.\n\nHow do / estimate burnsize and depth?"

Thepercentage of total body surface of the infant's head istwice that of the normal adult. The palmar surface (in-cluding the fingers) of the patient's hand represents ap.proximately 1% of the patient's body surface. Thisguideline helps estimate the extent of burns with irregu-lar outlines or distribution.\n\nThe depth of burn is important in evaluating the severity ofthe burn, planning for wound care, and predicting func-tional and cosmetic results.\n\nFirst-degree burns (eg, sunburn) are characterized byerythema, pain, and the absence ofblisters. They are not life-threatening, and generally do not require intravenous fluidreplacement. This type of burn is not discussed further inthis chapter.\n\nPartial-thickness, or second-degree, burns are character-ized by a red or mottled appearance with associated swellingand blister formation (Figure 9-2A). The surface can have aweeping, wet appearance and is painfully hypersensitive,even to air current.\n\nFull-thickness, OT third-degree, burns usually appear darkand leathery (Figure 9-2B). The skin also may appeartranslucent, mottled, or waxy white. The surface is painlessand generally dry; it may be red and does not blanch withpressure.\n\nPrimary Survey and Resuscitationof Patients with Burns\n\nA history of confinement in a burning environment or earlysigns of airway injury on arrival in the emergency depart-ment (ED) necessitate eval uation of the airway and defini-tive management. Pharyngeal thermal injuries can producemarked upper airway edema, and early maintenance of theairway is important. The clinical manifestations of inhala-tion injury may be subtle, and frequently do not appear inthe first 24 hours. If the doctor waits for x-ray evidence ofpulmonary injury or change in blood gas determinations,airway edema can preclude intubation, and a surgical air-way may be required.\n\nThe initial trea tment of airway injuries is based on the signsand symptoms, which can result from the following possi-ble injuries:\n\nDirect thermal injury, producing upper airwayedema and/or obstruction\n\n● Inhalation of products of combustion (carbon par-ticles) and toxic fumes, leading to chemical tracheo-bronchitis, edema, and pneumonia\n\nAlways assume CO exposure in patients who wereburned in enclosed areas. \"I'he diagnosis of CO poisoning is\n\n● Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning\n\n214 CHAPTER 9 · Thermal Injuries"

Patients with COlevels of less than 20% usually have no physical symptoms.Higher CO levels can result in: (1) headache and nausea(20%~30%), (2) confusion (30%-40%), (3) coma(40%-60%), and (4) death (>60%). Cherry-red skin coloris rare. Because of the increased affinity of CO for hemo-globin (240 times that of oxygen), it displaces oxygen fromthe hemoglobin molecule and shirts the oxyhemoglobin dis-\n\nsociation curve to the lef1. CO dissociates very slowly, and itshalf-lifeis 250 minutes (4 hours) while the patient is breath-ing room air, compared with 40 minutes while breathing100% oxygen. Therefore、 patients in whom CO exposure issuspected should receive high-flow oxygen via a nonre-breathing mask.\n\nEarly management of inhalation injury may require en-dotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Prior tointubation, the patienl should be preoxygenated with con-\n\ntinuous administration of oxygen. Intubation should beperf ormed early in patients with suspected airway injury.Because there is a high probability of the need for bron-choscopy in burn patients with airway injury, an endotra-cheaj tube of sufficient size shouldbe chosen for a defin itiveairway. Arterial blood gas determinations should be ob-tained as a baseline for the evaluation of the patient's pul-monary status. However, measurements of arterial PaO2 donot reliably predict CO poisoning, because a CO partialpressure of only 1 mm Hg results in a carboxyhemoglobinlevel of 40% OI greater. Therefore, baseline carboxyhemo-globin levels should be obtained, and 100% oxygen shouldbe administered.\n\nIf the patient's hemodynamic condition permits andspinal injury has been excluded, elevation of the head andchest by 30 degrees helps to reduce neck and chest walledema. If a full-thickness burn of the anterior and lateralchest wall leads to severe restriction of the chest wall mo-tion, even in the absence of a circumf erential burn, chestwall escharotomy may be required.\n\nCIRCULATING BLOOD VOLUME\n\n? What is the rate and type of fluidsadministered to patients with burns?\n\nEvaluation of circulating blood volume is often difficult inseverely burned patients. ln addition, these patients mayhave accompanying injuries tliat cause hypovolemic shock.Shock should be treated according to resuscitation princi-ples as previously outlined.

A good rule to follow is to infusefluids at a rate sufficient to produce 1.0 mL of urine per kilo-gram ofbody weight per hourfor children who weigh 30 kgor Iess, and 0.5 to 1.0 mL of urine per kilogram of bodyweight per hour in adults.\n\nPatients with burns require 2 to 4 mL of Ringer's lactatesolution per kilogram of body weight per percent of second-degree and third-degree body-surface burns in the first 24hours to maintain an adequate circulating blood volumeand provide adequate renal perfusion. The calculated fluidvolume is then proportioned in the following manner: halfthe total fluid is provided in the first 8 hours after the burninjury has occurred, and the remaining halfis administeredin the nexl 16 hours. In children who weigh 30 kg or less, thegoal is to maintain an average urinary output of1 mL/kg/hr.In these patients, it is necessary to administer maintenanceintravenous fluids containing glucose in addition to the burnformula.\n\nResuscitation formulas provide only an estimate of fluidneed.

How does cold affect my patient?\n\nTYPES OF COLD INJURY\n\nHow do / recognize a cold injury?\n\nThree types of cold injury are seen in trauma patients: frost-nip, Irostbite, and nonfreezing injury.\n\nFrostnip is the mildest form of cold injury. Itis characterizedby initial pain, pallor, and numbness of the affected bodypart. It is reversible with rewarming and does not result intissue loss, unless the injury is repeated over many years,which causes fat pad loss or atrophy.\n\n220 CHAPTER 9 · Thermal Injuries\n\nFrostbite is due to freezing of tissue with intracellular icecrystal formations, microvascular occlusion, and subsequenttissue anoxia. Some of the tissue damage also can result fromreperfusion injury that occurs on rewarming. Similarto thermal burns, froslbite is classified into first-degree,second-degree, third-degree, and fourth-degree accordingto depth of involvement.\n\n1. First-degree frostbite: Hyperemia and edema withoutskin necrosis\n\n2. Second-degree frostbite: Large, clear vesicle formationaccompanies the hyperemia and edema with partial-thickness skin necrosis\n\n3.

Fourth-degree frostbile: Full-thickness skin necrosis,including muscle and bone with gangrene\n\nAlthough the aff ected body part is typically initiallyhard, cold, white, and numb, the appearance of the lesionchanges frequently during the course of treatment.

Although the entire foot can appearblack, deep-tissue destruction may not be present. Alter-nating arterial vasospasm and vasodilation occur, with theaffected tissue first cold and numb, and then progressing tohyperemia in 24 to 48 hours. With hyperemia comes in-tense, painful burning and dysesthesia, as well as tissuedamage characterized by edema, blistering, redness, ec-chymosis, and ulcerations. Complications of local infec-tion, cellulitis, lymphangitis, and gangrene can occur.Proper attention to foot hygiene can prevent the occur-rence of most such injuries.\n\nChilblain, or pernio, is primarily a dermatologicmanifestation of chronic, repetitive, damp cold exposure,or long-term, dry cold exposure, as might occur in moun-tain climbers.

In the absence of anorganized rhythm, CPR should be instituted and continueduntil the patient is rewarmed or there are other indicationsto discontinue CPR. However, the exact role of CPR as anadjunct to rewarming remains controversial.\n\nPrevent heat loss by removing the patient from the coldenvironment and replacing wet, cold clothing with warmblankets. Administer oxygen via a bag-reservoir device. Thepatient should be treated in a critical care setting wheneverpossible. Cardiac monitoring is required.

Body-surface area differs considerably for children. The infant's or young child's head represents a larger proportion of the surface area, and the lower extremities represent a smaller proportion than an adult's. This guideline helps estimate the extent of burns with irregular outlines or distribution. As- sociated injuries can be sustained while the victim attempts to escape the fire, and in- jury from explosions can result in internal injuries or fractures (eg, central nervous system, myocardial, pulmonary, and abdominal injuries).2 Immediate lifesaving measures for patients with burn injury include the recognition of inhalation injury and subsequent endotracheal intubation, and the rapid institution of intravenous fluid therapy. All clothing should be removed rapidly. Early stabilization and treatment of the burn patient include identifying the extent and depth of the burn, es- tablishing fluid guidelines according to the patient's weight, initiating a patient-care flow sheet, obtaining baseline laboratory and x-ray studies, maintaining peripheral cir- culation in circumferential burns by performing an escharotomy if necessary, and iden- tifying which burn patients require transfer to a burn unit or center.. Diagnose the cause and severity of cold injury by obtaining an adequate history and noting the physical findings, as well as measuring the core temperature using a low-tem- perature range thermometer (esophageal temperature probe is preferred). The patient should be removed from the cold environment immediately, and vital signs should be monitored and supported continuously. Rewarming techniques should be applied as soon as possible. The patient with hypothermia should not be considered dead until rewarm- ing has occurred. Early management of cold-injured patients includes: adhering to the ABCDEs of resuscitation, identifying the type and extent of cold injury, measuring the patient's core temperature, initiating a patient-care flow sheet, initiating rapid rewarm- ing techniques, and determining the patient's life or death status after rewarming.3 Attention must be paid to special problems unique to thermal injuries.
