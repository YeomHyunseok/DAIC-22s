Historically, developing countries prioritize primary care efforts and outpatient clinic-based health care models. Ghana has added emergency medicine infrastructure to its health care system in an effort to address the ongoing shift in disease epidemiology as the population urbanizes, mobilizes, and ages. Ghana’s investments include prehospital care, personnel training, health care resource provision, communication improvements, transportation services, and new health facilities. This is in addition to re-educating frontline health care providers and developing infrastructure for specialist training. Change was fueled by public support, partnerships between international organizations and domestic stakeholders, and several individual champions.Conclusion:Emergency medicine as a horizontal component of low- to middle-income countries’ health systems may fuel national health and economic development. Ghana’s experience may serve as a model. BODY: Discussion:Ghana’s health leadership has affirmed emergency care as a necessary adjunct to its preexisting primary health care model.
