Despite five decades of intensive research, there are no widely accepted neuroprotective drugs that mitigate ischemic brain injury, or neuroreparative drugs, or personalized approaches that guide therapies to enhance recovery. We here explore novel reverse translational approaches that will complement traditional forward translational methods in identifying mechanisms relevant to human stroke outcome. Although Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs), have yielded over 30 genetic loci that influence ischemic stroke risk, only a few GWASs have been performed for stroke outcome. We discuss important considerations for genetic studies of ischemic stroke outcome—including carefully designed phenotypes that capture injury/recovery mechanisms, anchored in time to stroke onset. We also address recent GWASs that provide insight into mechanisms underlying brain injury and repair. There are several ongoing initiatives exploring genomic associations with novel phenotypes related to stroke outcome. To improve the understanding of the genetic architecture of ischemic stroke outcome, larger studies using standardized phenotypes embedded in standard-of-care measures are needed. Novel techniques beyond GWAS— including exploiting informatics, multi-omics, and novel analytics—promise to uncover genetic and molecular pathways from which drug targets and other new interventions may be identified."
